                --The review contains minor spoilers--
Since I've seen a plethora of scores of 10 for this show, I thought I'd write what I feel is a more realistic review for this show. Sword Art Online is more or less the equivalent of a fanfiction in it's writing and quality. Whether people want to overlook it or not is up to the individual, but I believe it fails at the fundamentals for writing a good story. This review will go into details as to my opinions on why I feel this way. 
1) Story - This is first major problem is the show. Let's start from the
                  beginning shall we. The first arc consists of 14 episodes. The first 2 episodes are honestly pretty good and set up the plot of the show that should follow. You're introduced to the main characters and it shows mmo style of play. I mean with 2 episodes that are amazing, surely what follows will be more of the adventures of the main characters and these mmo boss fights...right? Wrong. What follows are 5 completely irrelevant side character episodes and unnecessary terrible time skips that ruin any sense of a story the first 2 episodes set up. So due to some illogical reason, we're now down to 7 episodes to tell the rest of this story. Still doable right? RIGHT? Wrong again. The series wastes another 2 1/2 episodes on pointless filler garbage. So there you have it over half of first part of the story has nothing to do with the overall plot. Well what about the other episodes you ask? The remaining ""plot"" episodes are filled with deus ex machina in its purest form. Even the finale of the first season makes absolutely no sense. This isn't a fantasy world, it's a freaking video game, you can't have miracles here. So that concludes my issues with season 1, which the majority of SAO fans consider to be the best part....Yeh you heard me, the 2nd part is even worse.
       Without going into spoilers, the 2nd part of the series takes place in a different setting, with a mostly new cast aside from our main hero. This part of the series probably deserves the award for most unnecessary story in the history of anime. This arc is pretty much a mario game. Our hero must save the princess in the castle. Not really much to say about it. Oh yeh deus ex machina finale here too...oh and there's an incest subplot...for some reason. This concludes the plot section. I think I'm being pretty generous with a 4 here. 
2) Art - The art is fantastic. Colorful characters, bosses (the few we see), and settings are all here. It's easily worth an 8.
3) Sound - Again fantastic. Nothing wrong with it at all. 8.
4)Characters - Here we go...This is easily the worst part of the series. I'll separate the main characters and lump together the not so main characters.
Kirito/Kazuto - The main character of this show is the epitome of the current definition of a ""Gary Stu"". He has no personality whatsoever. He is good at everything he tries for no reason. He's an amazing player, an super sleuth, a ladies man, and a master hacker. You name it, he can do it. There's no reason given for this other than he's just that good. Girls all love him, guys want to be him, and villains are jealous of him. He also solos MMO boss fights...yeh wrap your head around that one. Side note - I often see people claim they love this show because they're hardcore gamers. I have to say as an avid gamer myself I find this show to be insulting. Unless you've hacked or cheated , I don't understand why you're content with a character who does. Side note over. 
Asuna - The main female lead/most blatant waifu  character ever. Asuna is introduced as a strong player who can stand on her own with Kirito, that is for the first couple episodes. Once she reappears she barely does anything other than cook for Kirito. That's right, her ass stays in the kitchen, while Kirito does all the important stuff. In part 2 she does absolutely nothing...seriously. She again has no original personality...textbook Tsundere. 
Yui - This character is terrible in all senses of the word. She's walking deus ex machina, nothing more. This character should be hated by any gamer, since she's a cheat device, who adds nothing to the story. 
Villains (minor spoilers) - There are 2 major villains in this series and they're both terrible. The first one forgets his motives for doing everything in part 1 and the part 2 one is so comically evil he can't even be taken seriously. 
Other Characters/ Who the hell cares - The female characters all want to have sex with Kirito and have no personality past this. The male characters don't get to do anything because Kirito hogs the show from everyone. That's really all there is to say about that.
Suguha - This is Kirito's sister. She honestly has layers and was a plus to the show in my opinion. I don't know why she's in this show, she doesn't belong in it...
So yeh, Gary Stu and Waifu - these characters are pathetic (1).
5) Enjoyment - Needless to say I didn't enjoy it. Poor show (3)
6) Overall - This show has so many fans, and I really don't know why. Its plot is rushed and terrible. Its characters so flat, it's almost funny...almost. Its romance is highly misogynistic and terribly developed. I felt insulted watching this, and don't understand how any could like this show. Even Gamers.",4

                I don't really want to go into too much depth, but I'd like to give an overview of the series and give my opinions it. If you haven't noticed yet there are many negative reviews out there for this anime, and while many of them bring up some pretty fair points, I think some people are being a bit too harsh on it. Let me explain. 
Yes it's a popular anime, yes it has flaws, no it's not perfect, but at the very least in my opinion it is enjoyable. The pacing is off, the beginning particularly feels rushed, there were moments where I thought
                  I skipped an episode because of the time skips which made it difficult to really connect with any of the characters in the beginning, and there were some less than stellar instances where it felt like the anime was trying to make me care but failing hard. 
Some characters felt to be completely forgotten throughout most of this series too. For example in the beginning we are introduced to a character named Klein who is quickly pushed aside after the first episode and barely seen again and doesn't really make much of an impact at all on the story later on. This seems to happen a lot throughout this series where there might be some emotional moments where a character dies, or something dramatic happens but there is really no emotional impact from it, and the main character seems to not really care that much about it or it doesn't really effect anything significantly.
I really felt this series shined from around episodes 4-13 and I wish they would have kept with that pace instead of rushing an ending midway and throwing something new at us. The second half just felt completely unnecessary and forced. 
Pushing the negative aside, I found the overall theme and atmosphere of the series to be great, and being an avid lover the MMORPG genre obviously a lot of things in this series appealed to me. I really enjoyed the idea of being stuck in a game that was impossible to escape from without winning and having real consequences, it really made everything much more dramatic and meaningful in the story. Sadly this quickly goes away midway through the plot. 
If I had to pick two of the best things this anime did well for me it would probably be the animation and soundtrack. They both were really well done, and honestly without them being as good as they were this series would have gotten a much lower score from me, and when I say I really enjoyed the soundtrack I mean that I loved it, it was superb. 
I think what it really comes down was just the fact that I enjoyed watching it. I can look at the flaws and pick the anime apart pretty easily, but those flaws never really stopped me from enjoying this anime.I really do feel though that it had a lot of potential to be a top tier series, it just made far too many mistakes. Looking at it objectively I simply cannot give this anime higher than a 7. It was good because I found it to be enjoyable, but it wasn't great or amazing. 
At the end of the day I watch anime because I want something that will entertain me and keep me interested, and I feel that Sword Art Online did a good job at accomplishing that.",7
"
                Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a brave young boy. He was the best swordsman in the land and the manliest man of all. He overcame countless trials with little effort and won the hearts of many fair maidens.
Yes, it's time for Sword Art Online, the origin of many angry rants. 
The premise doesn't sound too bad. Ten thousand players of a virtual MMO are trapped in the game and forced to complete it to escape, except that death in the game leads to death in real life. Just think about it: this could be a tragic story of struggle
                  where death is behind every corner. A story of sacrifice and despair. A story of alliances and betrayal. A story of the struggle to retain humanity in front of impossible conditions. 
...But why have any of that when you can have romance and harem?
That's right; the survival game is just for show. Don't expect deep interpersonal or political conflict. Don't expect psychology or moral dilemmas. Don't expect tactics or mind games. Actually, don't expect witty dialogue of any kind.
And that is the biggest problem with this show. It is bankrupt in substance. It's mostly just uninspired romance and harem, with a bit of action here and there. There isn't much thinking involved. A few plot holes I could forgive, but if the show isn't about anything worthwhile, there isn't much to do. What makes this problem all the more apparent is that the premise promises something entirely different than what it delivers. The show has thrown its hands up in the air and said, ""We don't care."" So why should the viewer? 
It doesn't help that the show has grown infamous for glorifying its protagonist, who in the eyes of many has become the epitome of a Gary Stu. He can defeat anything, he can solve any problem, and he gets all the girls. It's almost like this show was meant to be a propaganda piece in his favor.
Story: 3
The first two episodes are decent, building up the premise. We are introduced to the protagonist Kirito and the concept of the death game. Soon enough, we are told that a month has passed and two thousand players have died offscreen. ...Wait, not even a short montage or anything? Apparently not. Anyway, these two episodes are pretty much the only decent ones, so savor them while you can.
The third episode begins to show more serious problems. We are supposed to form an emotional bond to new characters in a few minutes, and we have to go through over-the-top angst over irrational actions. But there is also optimism in the air; of course we can revive someone whose brain has been fried, right?
What follows is an abrupt leap to harem and romance antics. The next few episodes are about various girls suddenly falling for Kirito, often the same day they met him. This typically involves uncontrollable blushing, fanservice, and people acting Tsundere. You probably get the picture. It doesn't help that many of these episodes have a very filler-esque feel to them. The main plot ‒ if you can call it such at this point ‒ takes a backseat in favor of these random new girls. 
The girl called Asuna, who quickly becomes the token love interest for Kirito, has at least met him before, but there is still very little buildup to their relationship. Unless it took place offscreen. You see, another thing that becomes very noticeable is the pacing. There have been timeskips of months between episodes. This wouldn't be a problem if these snapshots contained all the events that were critical to the story, but it's obvious that the author has picked rather boring events out of all the possibilities. Why is it that thousands of people dying is covered in a few lines, while we have to sit through hours and hours of romance and harem? I hate to be beating a dead horse here, but it's unavoidable because it comes up again in just about every episode.
By now, it has also become obvious to the viewer that Kirito is invincible to the point of tedium. He has a level higher than anyone, the best equipment, and a seemingly endless pool of abilities, but most importantly he always wins. There is sometimes false tension, sure, but you know he will survive anyway. You can only stomach so many clutch survivals before you start rolling your eyes.
The rest of the story arc involves Kirito and Asuna hanging out in the countryside to spend their honeymoon. They even adopt a daughter to portray a typical happy family. The problem is that their relationship is really not that interesting. But ""dem feels""! Nah, sorry. I have a heart of stone. 
This is followed by a sudden confrontation with the main villain, which Kirito wins because the power of love conquers all. And by that I mean the power of love conquers the programming of the game. Well, okay, maybe there was some ""power of love"" clause in the code somewhere. It wouldn't surprise me at this point.
Predictably enough, melodrama ensues. Tears, promises of love, etc. You can probably imagine. At least now we're done with this show, right?
No, think again, that was only the good part. There are actually 11 more episodes left, and the journey takes us further downhill. We enter another game, this time without the death aspect. Before we get to the plot itself, even at a glance this idea brings up a few problems.
The harsh reality hits you faster than you can say ""cashcow."" This second arc feels completely unnecessary. It has been tied into the original story with an overly convenient plot device for no apparent purpose other than stretching it further. At least know to quit while you're ahead. But no, they just had to drag this show through the mud to rip apart any shred of dignity it had left.
It doesn't help that there is no death anymore. While this makes the slice-of-life content more fitting, it also removes the established selling point of the show. The change is too abrupt, and the difference in tone is too jarring. If you want to make a slice-of-life of ordinary MMO players, do it from the start. 
Now, for the plot itself, and it isn't pretty. We go straight to a Mario game, by which I mean saving a damsel in distress trapped in a cage. And that isn't a metaphor; she is quite literally trapped in a cage. Add tentacles and incest to the plot, and you have a winning combination. The incest aspect is provided by Kirito's sister Suguha, who also provides additional fanservice.
At least now the pacing is less erratic and there is seemingly less development taking place offscreen. It's just too bad that there is also very little meaningful taking place onscreen. There are some new characters and even an ingame war going on, but it's all so irrelevant to the main story that it's hard to maintain interest. 
Long story short, Kirito beats the second villain with the help of more deus ex machinas. There are also more tears, promises of love, etc.
So now we're done, right? For now, yes, but there's still season 2 to look forward to. 
Setting:
This is technically part of the story category, but I really think it deserves its own section here. You see, the very foundations of the setting make no sense. People in Sword Art Online are too often acting like they are in a normal game, not in a life-and-death scenario.
For instance, why is there so much resentment towards beta testers who have greater knowledge of the game? This isn't a competition; the faster someone beats the game, the faster everyone gets out. And, similarly, why are beta testers reluctant to share information? Are they so worried about other people using their newfound abilities to kill them for no reason? Look, you can't have both a casual slice-of-life of MMO players and a grim death game at the same time. Pick one. 
This casual attitude becomes more pronounced later on when it becomes obvious people are wasting tons of time with unproductive quests, romance, and just hanging around. Kirito himself spends time on seemingly useless sidequests, and Asuna spends time cooking for him. Come to think of it, why has Asuna wasted points on a useless skill like cooking in the first place? Are these people even trying?
And why are so many players dying when towns are safe zones? Are they stupidly rushing into high-level dungeons? I suppose so. You see, for a grim death game it sure is hard to die in SAO. Bosses won't respawn, so everyone can advance forward, even weak players. Going from town to town is also easy enough with teleport crystals. Well, okay, there is that problem of challenging people to a duel while asleep, but that can't take out so many. 
There is no lack of critical resources because you can hang out in the safety of towns indefinitely. Sure, exp and money are limited because the regeneration of monsters is limited, which is strange game design itself, but they aren't necessary if you stay in town. At least, the show never implies that they are necessary. Oh, and for the record, I'm treating the show as self-contained and ignoring the source material. 
So why do they die? I'd put my money on rushing stupidly into dungeons because we get to see one notable example.
Let's imagine you found yourself in the following situation. Before you and your guild are about to enter a high-level dungeon, you learn that one of them lied about his level. Knowing this, you realize you are underleveled and likely to end up dead, while avoiding death and warning the others would be as simple as staying in town.
What would you do? Would you
a) Record a message in advance, knowing that you wouldn't last long, or
b) Stay in town so that you wouldn't get killed in the first place?
A tricky one, I admit.
We are also introduced to groups of player killers. Sounds good until you realize this isn't a normal game. At least, I thought it wasn't, but it looks like some people didn't get the memo. In a situation like SAO, there should be no reason for these killings. This isn't Danganronpa, where the main point of the premise is that you can only escape by killing someone. This is a game where it makes the most sense to team up and beat the game. There is no prisoner's dilemma; cooperation is the best plan and any sensible person would go for it. 
If you kill someone here, you only get some money and equipment. While it may help you beat the game a little faster, odds are that it will only hurt your chances of survival overall. Just off the top of my head, a few reasons: 
1) If people start killing each other, it obviously increases the risk of dying yourself, both in retaliation and spontaneously.
2) Killing people reduces manpower needed for beating the game, and the distrust that follows will make it even slower. You could only kill useless low-level players, but they probably don't have much money or good equipment to begin with. 
3) There is the chance that you will land murder charges if you escape from the game and officials find out.
Actually, does the equipment even help that much? Kirito seemingly uses the same equipment for long periods of time, yet he is practically invincible. On the other hand, he does say that equipment can be worth many levels, so did he get the best stuff for himself so fast? Is it strange game design or cheat codes? It's anyone's guess.
Of course, if you have little interest in beating the game, killing other players makes more sense, if only a little. I suppose getting more money can help you obtain some luxury items, but is it worth the risk? The implied reason is that they are killing people for laughs, but why did so many murderous psychopaths decide to log into this MMO on its opening day? Is this some kind of stab at gamers, saying that they are unable to distinguish between real violence and fake violence? Maybe, or the author forgot that this isn't a normal MMO. Again.
So is it a legit plan to stay in the virtual world for the rest of your life and give up on getting back to the real world? If so, it would explain a lot. While the range of pastimes in there is smaller than in the real world, maybe there is enough for some people. 
The choice between staying in relative happiness in a virtual world and risking your life returning to the real world could have been an interesting one. Unfortunately, their bodies are deteriorating in real life, which makes the choice very one-sided. For some reason, Asuna has to point this out to Kirito because apparently the state of his real-world body had never occurred to him over the course of two years. Yeah, good job, Kirito, you sure were fast on the uptake. Lying down on the grass and having a carefree nap doesn't sound so smart anymore, eh? 
Finally, why are virtual MMOs still legal after the SAO incident? Sure, the new hardware is supposedly safer, but the previous death trap must have equally passed through ""strict"" government examination, so who in their right mind would trust them? And even if we assume it is safe, since when has people's hysteria hinged on facts? People fear new technology even when it's harmless, let alone when a massive incident like this happens. There would be mass protests in the streets in favor of banning them.
Characters: 2
You may have noticed that I have only mentioned three characters by name so far. For some other show, this might be because the cast is so vast that there is no time to go through them all, but here it's rather that there are very few characters worth mentioning. Kirito, and by extension Asuna and Suguha who are defined by Kirito's character, hog practically all of the screentime. 
Everyone else gets thrown under the bus. Girls only exist to fall in love with Kirito, and males only exist to be inferior to him. The villains in particular only exist as fodder to the guy.
Kirito:
I have barely touched on Kirito's personality. Well, blame the show, not me; it should at least be willing to meet me halfway. We know very little about him, other than being invincible and inexplicably good with the ladies. Essentially, he is the manliest man on the planet.
That's pretty much all he is. Even his dialogue ends up pretty bland. There are no witty insights, no clever jokes, no skillful word games. Much of his dialogue consists of saying that the world is a virtual one, explaining game mechanics, wishing to save everyone, or loving someone forever. The sort of stuff you'd expect from a cardboard cutout hero in a situation like this. 
It can be a facepalm-worthy experience to witness girl after girl falling for Kirito like nothing, often the same day they met him. The show endlessly drills into the viewer that he is the sexiest man alive... for some reason. I get that rescuing people can give you points in their eyes, but come on now. I can only assume there is a hidden manliness stat and his black jacket comes with a +999 boost.
As far as his invincibility goes, the win streak by itself isn't the biggest problem. The problem is that he always wins through brute strength. That is to say, his character skills and stats. There are no tactics worth mentioning, no psychology, no politics, no thinking whatsoever. He will just go out there and pull off his generic action hero stunts. Sure, developing those skills and stats may have required some tactical thinking. Maybe he has optimized his skill tree or has amazing grinding strats. In theory. We see no hints of it. It all happened offscreen and offscreen doesn't count. I'm sorry, it just doesn't. 
To add insult to injury, some of Kirito's abilities are completely forgotten later on. I'm sure that health recovery thing would have come in handy any number of times. And when even his skills and stats aren't enough, he is saved by plot armor at the last second.
It's also a mockery of MMOs in the sense that Kirito is able to solo raid bosses. And he is able to attain a level higher than anyone despite playing solo, supposedly because he doesn't have to split the exp. His most unique ability is revealed to be... *drumroll* dual-wielding, which nobody else is allowed to do in this game. This doesn't sound like any MMO I know of, or was the idea to portray a player with god-mode cheats on?
I'm seriously thinking that the show would have been a lot more tolerable if Kirito alone had been replaced by one of the side characters. It still wouldn't have been a masterpiece or anything, but at least the Gary Stu accusations could have been avoided.
Asuna:
She is about as bland in personality as Kirito. She is also portrayed as fairly powerful for no substantial reason but of course nothing compared to him. As time passes, her most notable trait becomes being a textbook Tsundere.
...Well, that was fast. Moving on.
Suguha:
As mentioned earlier, her main role is providing fanservice and a tacked-on incest subplot. It's simply another element thrown into the plot for cheap shock value, if anyone is still shocked by incest in anime nowadays.
Villain #1:
The first villain barely appears, and his motivation for trapping the players is vague, to say the least. He basically did it out of personal interest. He wanted to create a virtual world where death has meaning like in the real one, but as for why he was interested in the idea, he forgot. Err, alright then. Moving on.
Villain #2:
The second villain is pathetic and a disgrace to antagonists everywhere, coming across as a cartoon villain who does evil things for the sake of being evil. The conflict here is portrayed as completely black-and-white, just in case someone had sympathy for the guy, as unlikely as that is. 
His main focus is essentially raping a comatose girl. And that is over obtaining tons of cash, presumably in the millions. If he had left the girl alone, he probably would have got away with it, so for all intents and purposes, he chose raping a girl over millions in cash. Talk about priorities. 
Come to think of it, it's already ridiculous that the family of the comatose girl is planning to have her marry the guy. I mean, she is in a coma. As in unconscious, unable to state her own intentions, etc. Where are child protective services when you need them? Thankfully, the law disagrees, so they can't apply for an official marriage. Instead, he'll be adopted by her family as their son in spirit... Wait, what? 
Furthermore, his sheer incompetence is mindboggling. He openly explains his evil plans and his security is practically at Dr. Evil level, up to entering a secret keycode in plain sight so that the prisoner can see. Thankfully the government and his company are equally incompetent and are not monitoring his research group closely despite its reliance on infamous technology used in SAO. Are these the same people who deemed the new tech safe? If so, I'd like a second opinion. I wouldn't trust these people to operate Angry Birds, let alone a virtual MMO with potential health risks. 
Art: 7
So this is where the money went. The backgrounds look nice but cheap fanservice scenes not so much. 
Sound: 7
Not too bad either. The soundtrack and opening and ending songs work pretty decently, and the voices are also alright.
Enjoyment: 5
Funnier than I was expecting but for the wrong reasons. There is something earnest about how the show is trying to portray escapism and human relationships, but it falls just short enough to create a dissonance.
Overall: 3
Watch it to witness the writing yourself. But more importantly, by watching the show you can better understand the reviews or, better yet, write one yourself.",2

                Once in a while, there comes along a title (be it movie, book or anime) that takes the audience by storm, sweeping numerous off their feat, leaving several with a bad aftertaste in their mouth and making a few pass the work off  as ‘average’ or ‘mediocre’. Online communities, forums, chat rooms and every other nook and corner of the internet known to man turn into arenas of debates, discussions, fanboyism/fangirlism and flaming. It’s apparent that when something is popular, it doesn’t always get to bath in praises. With the acclaim, comes a sheer amount of criticisms. Also, it goes without saying that popularity
                  doesn’t necessarily equate to quality. 
Sword Art Online, abbreviated as SAO from this point on, is no exception.   
SAO, the anime adaptation of a series of light novels of the same name by Kawahara Reki, has been the much talked about show of the Summer and Fall 2012 seasons, and taking into consideration the incredible hype surrounding it with reviews of mixed sorts, it’s likely to stay that way for quite some time. Keeping in mind the vogue of MMORPGs and the demand for something ‘captivating’, the team behind SAO attempts to bring an enticing work to the table by executing the intriguing premise of ‘players trapped in a VRMMORPG where death equates to death in real life and the only way out is to clear the game’. Unfortunately, SAO fails at many levels which is a shame because when the anime kicked off with the highly anticipated first episode, all seemed well and it gave the vibes of something truly worth spending your time on but then it does a flip and from this point, things go awry. And here we have it— one of the most controversial anime of the recent years. 
Before proceeding with the review, let’s get one thing straight. I have not read the original source material— the light novels, that is. Hence, I’m not going to draw any comparison between that and the anime. With that out of the way, let’s keep the ball rolling.  
SAO on the surface has a fairly interesting premise, no doubt, and it’s executed well to some extent or so did it initially seem. The very idea of a large number of people logged into a VRMMORPG with the intention of embarking on a virtual reality adventure but only to be struck with utter horror as they’re faced with the shocking truth of the game has been put into effect quite satisfactorily in the first episode. It’s pretty much what I’d call an excellent start. However, SAO effortlessly manages to send all my expectations and enthusiasm down the drain for it takes the show only an episode or two to reveal its true colours followed by the disappointment it has in store.  
So, what goes wrong? Well, many things.  
Following the Great Beginning, the first arc decides to take a detour and invests on a few episodes dealing with side stories in which our protagonist Kirito gets acquainted with one girl per episode and ends up rescuing her from a jam. This is precisely why I like referring to this bunch of side stories as ‘episodic harem’ wherein the primary heroine of the story and Kirito’s love interest Asuna is assumed to be constant and the other girls are variables. Now this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. However, these side stories have very little to nothing to contribute to the series as a whole. Admittedly, they equip the viewers with some clever, little details here and there regarding how the game world works but they hardly have any bearing to the overall plot. The primary goal of these filler-like episodes appears to be that of giving our hero clad in black an opportunity to flaunt how much of a chick magnet he is and how he has it all that takes to be the coolest dude in this world made up of zillions of pixels. To boot, the characters (read: cute chicks) that appear in these episodes have absolutely no substantial role to play in the story later on. ‘Side’ characters indeed. And SAO knows how to effectively sideline them. 
When the arc finally gets itself back on track, it’s only natural to hope that the show will now have something worthwhile to deliver. However, that isn’t the case. If anything, some severe cracks begin to appear as very soon the focus of SAO is the romance between the two leads which is, in one word, cheesy. At this point, opinions are divided. The romance aspect, for some, can be appealing while for others, it can be a major turn off especially if they don’t like the characters involved. It all comes down to personal preference. However, personal preferences aren’t a convincing excuse by any means to overlook the fact that the story, world building and everything else take a backseat for the sake of allowing the two leads to be lovey-dovey in the backdrop of gorgeous sceneries. When the arc does manage to divert its focus on to some ‘serious business’, things look good for a while but with a rather unimpressive ending, the first arc concludes on a pretty bad note in my book.  
And then begins the second arc which, to be blunt, is a letdown again. 
The second arc or the ALO arc is set within ALfheim Online, a VRMMORPG successor to SAO. Kirito logs in with a mission to rescue his wife (Asuna, duh) from the clutches of an archetypical antagonist who is a disgrace to all the villains in fiction we have come across so far. This arc showcases some really eye candy visuals but that’s pretty much its only redeeming point. It doesn’t have anything much going on except for a few climactic action sequences now and then with intense battle music playing in the background that last only for a while. Not to mention, there’s another girl added to Kirito’s harem.  
And then the hilarity ensues.  
The manner in which ALO is brought to a close is appalling to say the least and at the same laughable because it doesn’t hesitate to use the much notorious plot device dues ex machina, ruining whatever hopes there were for the final confrontation with the villain. The poor conclusion could be excused if it was handled more cleverly and convincingly but a blatant ass pull is by no means satisfactory. If anything, it only proves that the writer faced a dead end and was unable to think of anything better and creative, and expected the audience to swallow down whatever he could come up with, no matter how downright stupid it is.  
Among all the other things, the most easily noticeable flaw without a doubt is the execution of the plot itself which is all over the place. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out after a couple of episodes that SAO suffers from poor pacing and inconsistency. It appears to be highly indecisive as to what exactly it wants to do and how to get it done. This is mostly evident in the first arc which is incredibly rushed at many parts. There’re timeskips and the next thing you realize is that the characters have already cleared quite a lot of floors while keeping us, the viewers, in the dark. This makes the plot disjointed, prevents any sort of correlation to the win-or-die situation that the characters have been put into and gives everything the feel of it being nothing more than a piece of cake. The struggle for survival and a sense of urgency are hardly felt even though the lives of the characters have been said to be literally at stake. The episodes dealing exclusively with the lead couple taking some time off for a ‘vacation’ and subsequently ending up building a virtual family can further make one wonder: Why are they so carefree when they’re supposed to chalk out plans to beat the game and make a quick escape? To put it in other words, the arc has a tendency to go off track. It lays down for itself one thing but ends up doing something else altogether. It’s uncertain as to whether to make itself come across as a story of survival set within a VRMMORPG or as a fluffy love story. In due course, it decides to juggle with both but doesn’t get either of them rightly done. Not to mention, when the situation demands it and the writer goes out of any creative ideas to move the story forward, the characters’ actions are made to contradict the established game mechanics and the only reasoning that’s provided for such miracles is ‘where there’s a will, there’s a way, and there’re times when true love and determination can overcome any obstacle in the game’.  
Now, for those who look for substance in any given story, it’s almost a fact that no amount of fanservice, eye candies, self-insertion or guilty pleasure factors can possibly compensate for a substandard storytelling. Yet that’s what SAO tries to do. It brings in all the aforementioned elements to sugarcoat its sloppy writing. On the whole, there’re no sincere efforts made to incorporate details that would contribute in some way or the other to world building or characterization whatsoever.  
While the poor quality of the writing is the key factor, the other aspect that contributes considerably to the mediocrity of the show is the characterization. Simply put, SAO’s characters are bland. Essentially, the show has its focus on only two characters: Kirito and Asuna. The others are just there; mere devices to move the story forward. And a few have nothing to contribute to the plot at all. For instance, the ones featuring in the side stories. 
Let’s talk about the protagonist Kirito first.  
An unsocial, reserved yet headstrong player who knows how to get things done his way and is determined to beat the game. That’s basically how Kirito is portrayed in the beginning. At this point, he seems like a good riddance from the generic wimpy male leads that have become so much of a commonplace in anime. A proficient main character who knows how to deal with things is something refreshing to witness once in a while. Unfortunately, the impressions didn’t last for long. In desperate attempts to make his character more ‘appealing’, Kirito is depicted as a ‘perfect’ being which leaves his character with little plausibility and much insipidity. 
He’s a guy with a heart of gold. 
He has an ‘ideal’ girlfriend/wife.
He’s admired by those around him. 
He can ‘unintentionally’ make every other woman adore him, romantically or otherwise.  
Thus, he serves as a mere self-insert character for wish-fulfilment and at the end of the day, there’s nothing ‘individualistic’ about him. Gary stu is probably what describes his character the best, and if paired with the Mary sue of the show, we get a lead couple that seems to have been cut out straight from a tacky romance fanfiction.  
Yes, when I mentioned ‘Mary sue’, I was referring to Asuna. 
Asuna as the female lead is as stereotyped as they come. Much like Kirito, her character is heavily idealized. She’s pretty, popular, kind, caring and every other man wants to have a piece of her. Oh, and did I mention her cooking skills that level up with each passing day? After all, her foremost duty is to cook for Kirito and show how much she cares for him. While initially she’s portrayed as a strong, independent female player with a tsundere-ish attitude, it doesn’t take her long to make a transition from that to a deplorable damsel in distress, requiring her knight in black robe to come to her rescue whenever she’s in a bind. Kirito fighting her guild leader to earn her some time for honeymooning is laughable to say the least. It soon becomes apparent that she doesn’t have much of a role other than serving as the love interest of the protagonist and being the object of fanservice now and then which might be successful in pleasing the male audience somehow but that alone can’t make up for her badly written character. In fact, the other female character the show cares to put the spotlight on also ends up becoming the target of fanservice but doesn’t have anything else going on for herself.  
If you haven’t guessed it already, I’m talking about Kirito’s beloved imouto. 
Throughout the first arc, the writer must have had been itching to include a love triangle in the story but couldn’t find a potential candidate to get the job done. As the first arc comes to a closure and the second arc begins, he grabs the opportunity, puts Asuna behind the bars (so that she’s not an interference in what he’s attempting to do) and introduces Suguha, Kirito’s cousin sister. The sole purpose of creating her character, it appears, is to make way for a generic love triangle and melodrama. Suguha loves her cousin but can’t do anything about it because he loves Asuna. That’s the bitter truth. Hence, she looks up to a certain someone she happens to befriend within ALO and hopes that he’d be able to sooth her aching heart. However, she gets trolled… badly. This, in turn, leads to more drama that’s somehow supposed to be heart wrenching but it isn’t.  
The remaining cast consists of two antagonists, both failing to make any sort of impression though the one making his debut in the second arc can be a good comic relief at times, and a bunch of side characters that wouldn’t have had made any difference even if they hadn’t existed. The bottom line is, the characters of SAO are a half-baked lot devoid of any depth or development. They could’ve perhaps turned out to be interesting if they were more fleshed out but who cares about that as long as they appeal to the intended target audience?  
Onto the technical aspects now.  
In the department of visuals, A-1 Pictures does a pretty good job. Within the game, the vast tracts of greenery, the beautiful cities during the night, the castles… they’re all a pleasure to behold. The animation is also well-handled for the most part. Initially I wasn’t much pleased with the character designs but they gradually grew on me, and I personally find a few characters like Asuna, Heathcliff and Lisbeth to be very well designed.  
The music is composed by one of the most renowned composers in the anime industry, Yuki Kajiura. While the soundtracks aren’t bad by any means, none of them stand out much except the one that plays during combat/intense scenes. In fact, that’s the only track that can be heard playing most of the time in the entire show. A few other tracks, though they aptly fit the scenes they’re played in, are easily forgettable. The same applies to the opening and ending themes. Nothing groundbreaking there. I’m a fan of almost all of Kajiura’s works and if compared to her previous works, SAO’s music is lacklustre to say the least and so much so that it’s hard to believe Kajiura is the composer to begin with. 
To wrap up the review, SAO had the potential to be something good but that potential goes down the drain due to poorly executed plot and bland characterization. It starts off in a satisfactory manner but goes downhill thereafter. Nevertheless, it can be an entertaining ride if one keeps their expectations low and swallows down whatever it has to offer without questioning anything. One of the reasons why SAO has been a letdown is the anticipation the majority had for it prior to its airing but that’s justified since the light novel series from which the anime is adapted is one of the most popular ones out there.

"
                Well then. SAO is indisputably one of the most polarizing anime in recent memory. It has devout fans who think it's one of the greatest, haters who think it's trash, and a minority that just says ""hey guys, can't we all just have different opinions?"" I hate the first and last groups with a fiery passion. I feel like breaking down why I think it's awful, so I'm writing a review. Let’s get into it, shall we?
Story:
The premise was a somewhat generic one, and “trapped in a video game” has been done numerous times before, but SAO seemed promising. And then the plot did everything
                  wrong. It utilizes time skips to avoid character development and many important events happen off screen and are never mentioned again or properly explained. Once Kirito was in a seemingly impossible to escape situation, but it just skipped to after he survived without ever explaining how he managed it. Because, I guess, that's not as important as filler episodes about Kirito resurrecting some irrelevant bitch's bird thingy. 
It lacks any amount of tension due to the main character having invincible plot armor and LE EPIC DUBBLE SWORDZ. I'm confused by the point of the double swords. Why was that his special thing? No one else was capable of putting another sword in their other hand? I mean, Jesus, if you're going to give the main character an overpowered weapon at least be creative. The funny thing is that although dual wielding was supposed to be Kirito's unique ability and this idea was drilled into our minds time and time again, other characters are shown dual wielding on several occasions. They seriously put no effort into this series. 
The worst aspect of the story was how rushed it was. The first half of the series was full of episodic filler episodes which did not develop the plot and mostly featured episodes about random women falling in love with the blank slate of a main and episodes centered on the uninspired romance between the two main characters. Because of this the episodes that were important to the plot were dealt with very quickly and almost glossed over in the grand scheme of things. 
Despite the supposed danger of the game, it seems like you would have to be a complete moron to get killed. Towns are safe, there are teleportation crystals, and boss fights were short and boring and easy. Besides, bosses don't respawn anyway. Then all of a sudden the arc came to an anticlimactic finish, illogically and out of nowhere. There was supposed to be 100 boss battles, but we're only shown a couple that are settled easily. But does SAO stop there? Nonono. It's not nearly bad enough yet.
The entire point of the series was an MMO where you couldn’t escape and would die if you lost. While Kirito is, for all practical purposes, invincible anyway, an incident occurs that makes the MMO even less dangerous, effectively killing any kind of promise the original premise had. The second half features even more girls falling for our boring protagonist, a spindly 16 year old gamer inexplicably overpowering a grown man, netorare, kind of-incest, almost-tentacle rape, a world without logic, the degradation of women, and our wonderful protagonist defying all the rules of the game with THE ETERNAL POWER OF LOOOOOVE.
(dude, I don't think that's how the programming works)
Chock full with plot holes, contradictions, deus ex machina, and diaboli ex machina, and devoid of foreshadowing, originality, or subtlety, this is one of the, if not the, worst plots I have ever encountered in any medium. And I've read ""120 Days of Sodom.""
Art:
Good scenery, but the character design was lacking. The characters were very generic looking and their armor and weapons weren't anything special. There were several atrocities as well. 
All of the fairies looked stupid, in my humble opinion. Especially the scary butterfly man. There were a couple instances of obvious mistakes like characters that should be in the background of a fight that disappear then reappear after, but that's nitpicking compared to the real problems with this series.
One weird thing was that Kirito was apparently supposed to look different in the game than he was in real life, based on important un-spoilable plot elements, but he looks exactly the same.
Sound:
Same as the art. It's alright, but that means nothing if the series has no substance. Good sound is just icing on the cake and icing won't make this cake taste any less like shit. 
Characters:
Oh, boy. This is the worst part.
Kirito: Kirito is a character who was designed as a blank slate so that losers could insert themselves into his place. He has no personality to speak of. He is the male Kristen Stewart of anime. His only unique trait or real aspect to his character is him being strong. Really. He's so strong people surrender to him without even fighting. He’s pretty much perfect for  a shut-in loser who’s addicted to video games. I mean, only a couple times in the series is he actually challenged because he is an all powerful 1337 b34t3r. Seriously, most of his enemies only hate him because they’re jealous. 
What is the point of an action series where the protagonist cuts through all of his enemies with the greatest of ease? There was more than one occasion where he died, but did not die because plot armor. Kirito is too cool for the silly rules of (virtual) reality that apply to everyone besides him.
Asuna: She's perfect as well. She's strong, beautiful, and most importantly, good at cooking. She falls in love with Kirito inexplicably and out of nowhere and they just have no chemistry. When you pair a Mary sue up with a blank slate/self-insertion you get a love story on the level of twilight.
I feel like the writers were trying to make her a strong female character at first, but seeing as how well she fits the female gender role, how often she must be the damsel in distress, and all the shameless fanservice, I'd say the portrayal of her character was archetypal to the highest degree and somewhat misogynistic. Ok, very misogynistic. She’s mostly here for Kirito to look cool. What kind of self-insert doesn’t have a Mary sue girlfriend? 
Suguha: She's Kirito's sister-cousin thingy. She's clearly very stupid because she did not recognize Kirito even though he looks no different in the game than he does in real life. All I can say about her besides that is this: she was thrown in for extra fanservice, obligatory incest, (Why is this a thing in Japan? Is the birth rate issue that bad?) a half-assed and predictable love triangle, and for another girl to love Kirito because, hey, you can never have too many. She has no personality and she's annoying. She’s pretty much here to emphasize Kirito’s coolness.
Villains: I don't remember these guys’s names tbh. There was a MMO designer guy who was responsible for a bunch of people's deaths, but for some reason we're supposed to think is good in the end. There's also the butterfly guy. He was my favorite because he was so hilarious, but he was also my least favorite because he was the least threatening villain ever. There were also two purple tentacle guys. I don't really know who they are and I think they were just there to grope Asuna, but they were weird.
As a whole the villains either have unrealistic motives or no motives at all. With the original programmer guy they try to make a morally grey villain, but fail entirely. He is also there to make Kirito look cool, but for reasons that I cannot describe in a spoiler-free review. With butterfly man they make him too pathetic and unrealistically evil. He was made like this to contrast with Kirito and so, like everybody else in the series, he’s just there to make Kirito look cool. And I don't know wtf to say about the purple tentacle guys. They were probably the best villains though. The desire to tentacle rape is certainly the most believable motive I encountered in this anime, especially seeing as most characters never even offered one. Although that is like saying that they are the undisputed champions of the Special Olympics, congrats to them anyways.
Honestly there were a lot more antagonists, but these ones are the only ones that matter enough to me to write about. The others weren't memorable enough to criticize. They were all bad, let's just say that. 
Everybody else: Because nobody else matters. Hell, I just put in Suguha to be nice and it's not like the villains actually matter because Kirito is pretty much invincible. Shit, Asuna only matters because she pleases Kirito. If Asuna didn't make such boss sandwiches, she wouldn't even be relevant to the story.
There are a couple recurring characters with no personality and no development, but they show up rarely and only to make Kirito look cool and/or fall in love with him. 
There are several incidents where Kirito inexplicably befriends or makes acquaintance of characters devoid of personality who do nothing, but get killed. And then we're supposed to care about the death of these random characters. You can't just introduce random characters, kill them, and say ""ohhhh dey died isnt dat saaaad."" You need development. 
Even worse is the thousands of unidentified characters that die early on in SAO. We're supposed to feel emotion about this, but any writer knows that reducing characters to mere numbers dehumanizes them thus removing all emotion from the equation. They probably skipped these scenes because they were incapable of making sympathetic and realistic character. This laziness and lack of ability foreshadowed the fate of the rest of the show's characters.
Did they even try? Of course they didn't. They don't have to and people will love it anyway. ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN.
Enjoyment:
I'm going to be honest: The most enjoyment I got out of this anime was laughing at the ""serious"" scenes. When Kirito introduced Asuna, in real life, as ""lightning flash Asuna"" and talked about her guild and power level, I seriously cried from laughter. Actually every time Kirito cried so did I. Just not in the way I think I was supposed to. I spat out my iced tea when the butterfly guy was licking agirlwhowillnnotbenamedforthesakeofnospoilers's face. That was too much. Seriously, it stained my shirt. Did anybody actually enjoy that scene? Did anybody actually take that seriously? The answer: no. Or, at least, I really hope that’s the answer. My God, I hope that’s the answer. 
As for the action aspect, I'm not sure how anybody would enjoy the action scenes, and I certainly did not. They were all too easy. There were a couple times when it tried to make it look like he was in trouble, but lo and behold, some miracle happened every time. Knowing how the fight will end is an unfortunate situation in plenty of anime, but those anime at least have more creative fight scenes and abilities or they are character oriented anyway. Even runescape has better and more interesting fights than this MMO. 
Besides the quality, there were quantity issues as well. This isn't really an action anime. The majority of the episodes were focused on Kirito saving Asuna from something, women falling in love with Kirito, or about Kirito and Asuna's boring relationship. I don't think there's a single episode that's ""action-packed."" Seeing as we were supposed to get 100 boss fights, this is a problem and it would be a letdown, but after a hundred of those dreary fights I believe I would likely die of boredom. 
The romance was just bad. There's much better romance out there and the characters had no chemistry. I'd prefer a romance with characters that are actually intriguing. Also, most anime focus on the build-up of the relationship a lot, but here it happens right away and there's no time to enjoy anything. This wouldn't be that bad if their relationship was interesting, but they don't have any serious arguments and are essentially the perfect couple. The only enjoyable developments in their relationship were the ones where Asuna was in danger. And by ""enjoyable developments"" I mean ""developments that made Kirito cry like a little girl."" Those moments were still awful, but comparatively speaking, they were rather enjoyable.
This is not an anime that I would recommend to anyone. I would not even recommend it to my worst enemy. That is cruelty of which I am not capable. It was atrocious, infuriating, corny, cliché, contrived, horrid, purple tentacled, pseudo-incestuous, borderline-misogynistic, vaguely misogynistic, completely misogynistic, plebeian, an affront to mankind, unintelligent, crafted by the devil, a war on art, used to torture terrorists, bourgeois, anti-intellectual, inbred, languid, shallow, self-insertionly, corny, the antithesis of Shakespeare, the apotheosis of awful fiction, blank, infantile, pathetic, vacuous, vapid, salacious, inane, imbecilic, an abortion, Stygian, sub-par, bland, poorly thought out, corny, loathsome, vomit-inducing, virulent, bile, poorly executed, infernal, eviscerating, flippant, an insult to its audience, cadaverific, philistine, lame, sad in all the wrong ways, funny in all the wrong ways, painful, paint-drying, boner-killing, wretched, impotent, generic, unemotional, repetitive, redundant, boring, and corny. I really really wish I hadn’t watched it. If you’re one of the people who told me it was a “must watch” then fuck you. Not even funny.",1

                Sword Art Online, aka The Twilight Saga for Teenage Boys.
In the beginning, Sword Art Online (SAO) looked like it could have turned out to be the best show of the year, no exaggeration. The premise of being stuck and unable to log out of a virtual reality MMO with the condition that dying in the game means you die in real life and the only way out is to clear all 100 floors was set up extremely well in the first episode. The second episode continued this with the first boss fight, supported by well-done animation and Yuki Kajiura's amazing-as-always score. At this point, hopes
                  were high.
But it didn't last.
The following few episodes were side stories from the original novel that have little to do with the overall plot. On their own, none of these are all that bad, but together they become rather tedious and ridiculous, especially when you realize that the focus of each one is the main character, Kirito, befriending and helping a cute girl (despite the fact that the female playerbase is said to only be 10%), and in more than half the cases, said girl getting attached to Kirito in more than a ""friendly"" way. And these characters, if they appear later at all, never again play a significant role.
These episodes would have worked better if they'd been placed throughout the series between story arcs - though it later becomes apparent that this would not actually work - or released separately as OVAs or DVD specials. The best thing to be said about them is that they help to give the game world some more depth since they explain some game mechanics and show viewers how the various groups of players are going about playing the game, but the information is mostly superfluous and could have easily been given to us through the main story. Not that any of it ever gets used again anyway.
Then the main story continues and things get...worse.
It's at this point that an idea starts developing that perhaps the writer of the novels merely had a good idea for a story but didn't know what to do with it past the premise. The above-mentioned side stories were included when they were because the show is being broadcast in chronological order; when the main story picks back up, it's been two years since the last main story episode. Bonds between characters have been formed off-screen and over the half the game has already been cleared.
What a rip-off.
Before continuing with the story, let's look at the characters. We have our protagonist Kirito, a solo player who knows his way around the game fairly well as a result of having been a beta tester for the game. Okay, this is cool. We don't need 12 episodes of training to become the best in every show, a strong-from-the-start MC is fine. But that's not quite what Kirito is. Kirito is portrayed as essentially perfect in every way; he never loses a (fair) fight, he always has a solution, and all the chicks dig him. Basically, Kirito is a Gary Stu, a self-insert wish-fulfillment character with no true substance (have you heard of that before, anime fans?). He even gets a special ability not given to any other player just because he's that awesome.
Now let's look at Asuna, the only other character the show actually cares about. She is initially portrayed as a strong, individual female who has abilities on par with the male characters. Again, this was good at first. But it quickly becomes clear that she only exists as otaku bait. She's extremely popular and beautiful and all the guys want her...but she only wants Kirito. And despite the fact that she is supposedly a strong player, she's treated more like a prize than a teammate; Kirito literally fights for her freedom from her guild more than once. Yeah, she can't even earn her own freedom for some vacation time after all the work she's been putting in for the past two years. Sexist much? No MMO guild leader would actually be this anal, but hey, we need to make Kirito look awesome somehow.
And really, that's all Asuna is here for: to enhance Kirito's badass status. When he almost dies, she's there to cling to him and cry for him. When Kirito needs to look awesome, she's put in some kind of trouble and he gets her out of it. She also cooks for him because her cooking level is so high because hey, your waifu needs to cook for you, Kirito.
Tailor Twilight so that it appeals to boys instead of girls and send your awful fanfic to the printing press. Sword Art Online has been born.
No, I'm not joking. Screw action, screw plot, cue romance. SAO skips out on all the floor-clearing and boss-killing and decides to just have its main characters play house and do character development backwards. Nothing is believable about the relationship between these two characters. We see no real development between them since the show kind of just drops us into the middle of things after those useless side stories are over. And this is the focus for multiple episodes. Lots of cheesy, lovey-dovey dialogue, hand-holding, and sleeping is what we're fed. It's an otaku wish-fulfillment, folks; you're in a medieval world, you're the strongest person around, the cute girls all want you, and you don't have to work because magic (game mechanics) supplies everything.
Oh, and breast-groping. Can't forget the blatant fanservice!
Another thing I praised the show for at first was that it seemed like an accurate portrayal of what a virtual reality MMO would actually be like. But, as usual, SAO managed to crap on itself. The whole ""beater"" concept, a combination of the words ""beta"" for beta testers and ""cheater,"" is laughably ridiculous and would never happen and obviously only exists to antagonize certain groups of players and give Kirito even more attention. We also see a group of players acting as an ""army"" of sorts going around forcing other players to pay taxes, even attacking an in-game daycare (LOL) in order to collect; this is dumb. Once again, a way to make Kirito and Asuna look like such sugoi people for helping out the needy children. Somewhere along the line the writer decided to make this a pseudo-medieval setting, taking what he wanted from the medieval era and what he wanted from MMO mechanics and not caring how they would make sense with each other. It's even written in the novel and alluded to in the anime that characters can have sex (but can't get pregnant, because that's no fun). Now that's taking cyber-sex to a whole new level. What would our wish-fulfillment world be without it?
But before too long we get to the climax of the first main arc, and after a couple miracles and deus ex machinas we can very clearly see that the author had no damn clue what he was going to do with his story after he had the premise down. The promise that was made to us has been broken and we, the viewers, are left with one of the most soulless shows to ever hit the airwaves. Any generic battle shounen at least gives us the action it promises and has better developed relationships and themes of friendship. Any generic harem at least knows it's dumb and only exists to appeal to that niche group of otaku who still enjoy it. SAO is a lie, a cheat, a traitor, and is worse than either of those. SAO wants you to believe it's good and smart, but it's so bad it doesn't even manage to achieve So Bad It's Good status. It's just terrible.
And now we're at the start of a new arc. Things...don't look any better. Kirito has added a new member to his harem in the form of a busty little sister/cousin (emphasis on that bust), because we needed some imouto fetish-fuel in here. Our antagonist is about as generic and stereotypical as they come, but that kind of fits because our new plot is about as generic and stereotypical as they come.
I've spent a lot of time on characters and plot without mentioning technical aspects because the technical aspects, no matter how good they are, really just won't change anything. They're there, and they're good; really, there's nothing wrong with them. Kajiura's music, when noticeable, is great and enhances the few good scenes the show has. The animation is also good. But neither is really amazing enough to be notable, so in the end, they just can't save a terrible piece of work.
And Sword Art Online is a downright terrible piece of work.

                After examining forums, comments, and reviews on Sword Art Online, it doesn't take a genius to recognize that this anime adaptation is one of the most controversial, disputable TV Series of the year. Thus, it'll be understandable if you disagreed with me at some point in this review, but please take the time to actually read it before deciding ""oh, just another fan boy"" or ""gross, just another hater."" Because, in my opinion, Sword Art Online doesn't deserve the amount of crap it gets or the amount of praises; essentially, it's mediocre.
First and foremost, the Sword Art Online TV Series is an adaptation of the
                  light novels under the same name. People who have witnessed this pattern unfold before know the difficulties in the adaptation process. For those of you new to the community, when a studio announces an adaptation it usually means two things: fan service, and fillers. Sword Art Online is a perfect victim for the studios these days that desire the big bucks. What derived from a romantic, unique concept was transformed into an utter construction of unoriginality and clichés. 
Other words, all the significant features residing in the original light novels were compacted down into seemingly unimportant bits and the wrong things got emphasized.
= Story (3) =
What the studios completely ignore first is the purity of the story, scripts, and chronological order of events. It doesn't even matter to the producers if positive/negative attention is given to Sword Art Online as long as the work gains popularity, discussions, and trends. Well, if you just watch anime collectively and only for enjoyment, it doesn't matter too much if the dialogues sound cheesy or unrealistic. However, there are too many clichéd story narratives, the dialogues require better writing, and [insert more heedless blobs of complaints you can read elsewhere].
The premise and first half of Sword Art Online actually poses an intriguing concept of survival of the fittest, which just isn't elaborated on enough to continuously track the audience's attention. In the actual light novel, there's much more emphasis on action-based themes than what's presented in the anime. Execution of the script definitely has problems, the pacing embodies inconsistencies which could've improved, and the story does contain some questionable timeline eclipses. However, it wouldn't exactly be the source material's fault if a parody of their work is bad. 
= Character (5) =
The main protagonist Kirito and his companion Asuna both illustrate essentially perfect beings. Kirito is a beater whose masculinity cannot be touched by anyone vincible. Comparatively, Asuna strives for a taint of sexiness with her slender yet untouchable body, and she can cook perfectly--somewhat misogynistic but inevitable. As a couple, Kirito and Asuna are both interesting subjects due to their fair share of intimate interactions with each other and other characters at first.
However, the chemistry between the two main romance interests, in the anime, quickly devolves into little or none at all. Events are laid out too bluntly, at a false pace, and Kirito's dedication for Asuna appears to be more artificial than in the light novels. Asuna became a target for fan service and though the appearance for fan service itself isn't exactly a terrible thing, the problem resides with how they applied that to more females. What shouldn't have processed through as a harem became apparent. Instead of illustrating the chemistry between Asuna and Kirito wholeheartedly, the Series often diverted with several unrelated (female) story arcs, which in turn didn't contribute to much of Kirito's phlegmatic personality anyways.
The main problem with the side characters is that barely any time is spent on them and most of them don't really have a purpose after their first appearance. Even when they do, you don't remember their names or why their presence is significant.
= Animation (8)/Sound (9) =
It's almost factual that nobody can complain about the artistic aspects of Sword Art Online. The impacting action scenes did themselves justice with intense atmospheres. Character designs transported from the light novels comprised of more details and it is overall fitting. Noticeably, the background in some of the scenes portrays a vivid, limitless sky, which soothingly befits the floating island setting.
The Original Sound Tracks from the anime are just fine. Although it would've been better to switch around its soundtracks, the synchronization of music with the art worked out efficiently. Both the Ops & EDs consisted of scores beautifully done by the artist; Yuki Kajiura strikes the mood perfectly yet again. Each voice acting roles also surprisingly resembled their character's traits.
= Enjoyment (7) =
Admittedly, Sword Art Online was a guilty pleasure the day it aired each week despite its flaws. The premise alone embraced me in a MMORPG setting which many have nostalgia for. Although a bit romanticized, the production actually portrayed the prehistoric Medieval Europe (in this case) and flourishing civilization of many cities like Venice at the time fairly well. And those familiar with the time period knows Sword Art Online just added another layer of wistfulness. 
Honestly, Sword Art Online provides decent entertainment if you watch it playfully without expecting serious, satirical works of some sort. Otherwise, it may be a disaster if you end up taking the concepts the show throws at you too literally. 
= Overall (5) =
A well thought-out premise and concept which ended up being jammed into a catastrophic adaptation—basic outline of Sword Art Online. It's really a shame that an action-packed Light Novel franchise became a victim of today's failing anime industry. This TV series comprises of lots of story arcs which should've been ignored, but was instead included due to their rewarding of pure fan service. 
There are too many trickled-down, mixed lighthearted scenes for someone to take the anime too seriously. Yet, the producer of the anime almost expects you to nonsensically. In the end, it's up to the audience to take Sword Art Online seriously or not. For one's health, I suggest viewing this TV Series as a romantic comedy with quirky action scenes and supernatural settings. Otherwise, for the real action-packed themes promised by the premise, I guarantee that the Light Novels will present a much better experience than this ""once-in-a-lifetime"" plebeian anime adaptation.",5

                Sword Art Online was one of the most hyped up animes of Summer 2012 and has probably the widest range of scores I’ve ever seen. Does it live up to the hype? Read on to find out! That being said, skip to the consensus (TLDR) if you don't want to read blocks of text! :D Please do not send anything overly negative to me; polite and constructive criticism is always appreciated.
PLOT:
The Good: Man, they really went for a lot here. The light novels themselves were actually more action/adventure focused, something that doesn’t happen in the anime. I’m going to do my best not to give
                  any spoilers, but essentially, the anime Sword Art Online aims to be a love story of epic proportions, where their relationship will experience highs and lows ranging from boundless joy to aching tragedy. Straight up, if you don’t like the main characters, you probably won’t like this anime. That’s how most love stories work. However, if you’re like me, and you absolutely adore the main characters, then this anime is definitely for you! Sword Art Online additionally does a brilliant job of easing us in to the massive, awe-inspiring frontier that is Aincrad. The concept of this anime -- being trapped in a strange, exotic new world and living in it -- is a dream that we all have had at one point, and it's fascinating to see it being unveiled before our eyes.
The Bad: At the same time, however, the execution has been done terribly. Lots of fans/first-time watchers – me included – felt that Kirito and Asuna were not given nearly enough character development. It’s hard to root for someone that you barely know or hate. Another problem lies in the pace. The side stories were rushed, no doubt about, which is bad because they offered interesting insights into Kirito and Asuna’s relationship and personality. At the same time, you can't really justify having two episodes of precious anime time being given to the side stories, and they honestly aren't as interesting as the main plot. Something else that irks me about Sword Art Online is how it suffers from deus ex machina. That is, it'll solve really big situations with just dumb stuff like ""it's the power of love"" or ""strength of will trumps everything"". However, other amazing shows (Harry Potter, Clannad) have done similar things, so it's whatever.
CONSENSUS: 7/10. Sword Art Online attempted to create a love story of epic proportions…something that they partially succeeded in. Although they eased us in beautifully in the start, undeveloped characters, a rushed storyline, and miracle syndrome make it lose quite a bit of its impact. 
ARTWORK: 
The artwork in this anime can be summed up into one word: inconsistent. The sceneries are drawn very well and have a wide variety (ranging from icy snowcaps to flowery meadows to beautiful cities…), and the characters are done beautifully (a nice contrast to the stupid body proportions in Code Geass or the crazy facial expressions in Fate/Zero), but it gets stupidly bad during the battles. For some strange reason, instead of treating us to a smooth action sequence, we instead constantly gaze at character still shots. It’s really frustrating when you know that the battle sequences could have been amazing!! Background animation is probably the most inconsistent part in that it gets really bad in towns but great in landscapes. I really don’t know what to think. I think the animation of this anime is something that really sets it back from some of the great animes, and I’m hoping it gets better in the future (especially the battle scenes, they can really make those a lot more enjoyable to wach).
CONSENSUS: 7/10. Battle scenes are very badly animated, and backgrounds sometimes are drawn very sloppily. However, the sheer scope of sceneries in this anime is a delight to see.
MUSIC: 
The music is incredible. Yuki Kajiura is one of the biggest names in anime music, and her music is absolutely astounding. So far, the music’s been perfect and set each mood beautifully. In particular, the battle scene music. Oh my god. I found myself humming it when I was eating breakfast, just a testament to how well done it is. As for the OP/ED, they’re really generic. They’re being done by LiSa, who’s done so many OP/EDs by now, but they don’t really stand out…in a good or bad way. I don’t know, I think Yuki Kajiura’s music makes up for any disparities here though.
CONSENSUS: 9/10, Music is great and going to be developed by Yuki Kajiura, the person who did Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica. OP/ED are generic, but that’s not a bad thing. 
CHARACTERS: 
The characters are ridiculously hit or miss. Kirito is pretty much your perfect, flawless teenager. That’s going to be a deal breaker for many of people upon knowing that. Many people like their protagonists to have flaws, to be more humanlike, more down to Earth, and having a character that’s flawless frankly drops a lot of the realism. I would like to argue that the alternative of having a whiny protagonist that doesn’t do anything is a lot worse though (Guilty Crown, I’m looking at you). The same lies for the female protagonist, Asuna, our main character’s love interest. Frankly, the relationship just came together too easily. Asuna also has the privilege of being practically perfect in every single way. No really: she can cook, she’s incredibly beautiful, she’s good at swordfighting, she’s dedicated, and she’s a tsundere (personally I love tsunderes). The side characters and the villains lack depth as well. Can anyone else picture how much more interesting this anime would have gotten if Sugou was initially some good guy that Asuna begins to fall for...only to be someone rotten in the inside? Instead, we're treated to a generic villain who literally doesn't have a single good quality.
CONSENSUS: 6/10, Main character Kirito isn’t absurdly annoying like A LOT of other main characters, but he does get what he wants a little too easily. Side characters are overly generic and get far too little time. Same with Kirito and Asuna, we needed more time for their development! 
THE BREAKDOWN: It's a great anime if you like Kirito and Asuna, but if you don't, you might as well watch another anime. The anime itself suffers from various flaws -- plot holes, shoddy animation, undeveloped characters -- that prevent me from giving it a high score. Still worth a watch though, if only so that you can rant about how good or bad it is on the forums after each episode. 7/10!
(+) The light novel for this anime is incredibly well done (#1 rated light novel on MAL).
(+) Incredible nostalgia for any MMORPG gamers.
(+) Music is stellar, designed by the best.
(+) Anime gets a lot better after episode 8.
(+) The landscapes are absolutely beautiful...one of the benefits of making the anime set in a fantasy video game.
(+) Tons of people to discuss this anime with since it's popular; since it's polarizing, you get some very interesting arguments too.
(−) Characters not developed thoroughly enough.
(−) Anime may be rushed in first few episodes.
(−) Suffers from very poor animation in some the fight scenes and in the background (budgeting). 
(−) Insertion of side stories before main plot may cause some viewers to lose interest.
(−) Anime suffers from miracle syndrome (occasionally will solve problems with a miracle).
(−) Causes you to waste time talking with people about the latest episode of SAO, whether you hate it or love it.",7
"
                A brave young hero. His beautiful sidekick who becomes a love interest. Dual wielding swords. A world in chaos. Lives at stake. All seem so cliche, why would I even think to watch this? I made the right decision to. I know there is alot of controversy over this anime currently so I, naturally, must enter my two cents to defend and be realistic about this hot commodity anime of 2012:
*As spoiler free as can possibly be*
Story:
The story is indeed EXTREMELY rushed. While the ideals and thoughts behind the initial plot are absolutely outstanding and completely unique and original, the SAO anime timeline leaves little
                  room for the storyline to blossom. As a 21 year old, I found it fairly childish at times yet still enjoyable. I feel as though younger people wouldn't appreciate the underlying plots which the plot holes failed to fill and give way completely to imagination. As a biased idealist, I give the story an 8/10 because the idea is there, the timeframe wasn't. But I guess that's to be expected in today's anime industry.
Art:
The art is visually stunning and appealing. The colors draw the viewer in and the scenery is the hook. The entire landscape of Aincrad is a feast for the eyes. On the flipside, some of the fights scenes were choppily done in comparison to the beauty of the backdrops. The boss details, especially the Skull Reaper, were phenomenal and several shots were created in a very different, unexpected perspective, adding additional interest to the episode's events. So that's an A++++ to colors and imaginary vision and a B to combat scenes to make a 9/10.
Sound:
Yuki Kajiura. Need I say more? 10/10. Absolutely outstanding and completely relevant and appropriate for the anime. The music truly makes the anime and hooks the viewer emotionally.
Character:
Kirito is your typical boy hero destined to save his love interest and destroy a corrupt system. Sure, seems pretty unoriginal. However, I connected to Kirito more than I feel many do. The episodes that seemed like fillers served as ways for us to get to know Kirito and his imperfections and taught us to let them go. While the anime completely fails in terms of side characters with failed attempts of Klein and Egil, the main characters are given enough spotlight to give the viewer a general consensus on their personality, actions, and values toward the Cardinal system of SAO. Asuna is a fantastic heroine at the beginning, immediately winning all the hearts of all male viewers and becoming a role model for young women. But as the anime progresses, the anime took a completely different direction in her character than I expected. While Asuna possessed so much strength and leadership, the anime fails to show this as it continues on, letting her slip into the whole damsel in distress role, especially in ALO. I truly felt the connection between her and Kirito and their desire to protect each other but their characters, as well as their love story, need more depth. 8/10.
Enjoyment:
I can't lie. I truly enjoy this anime. I have such a vision of it in my head that I feel the storymakers truly intended to get across to all viewers. Whilst the anime is lacking in depth, can be corny/childish/predictable, and is unreally rushed, it provides an entertaining feast for the eyes and ears and even for the heart from episodes 8 and on. I can't deny this one a 10/10 because I truly enjoy it.
Overall:
I have to give this anime a 10/10 wholly due to the fact that I can truly envision its perfection if it could be given more time. The character ideas are there, the unique and individualistic views are there, the fantastic composer and visual settings are there. It has the correct recipe, but the incorrect ""bake time"". Putting aside my bias, it should probably deserve a generous 9/10 due to plot holes, rushed timeframe, and incomplete character development.
Here's to hoping episode 25 will be a successful completion of an anime that could truly use a cherry on top of the sundae. The fandom will be on the edge of their seats and...so will I. I can't help it, this anime is my guilty pleasure.",9
"
                Why is SAO bad? First of all let us ask what SAO is and what bad is. SAO is an anime adaptation of a light novel of the same name. The light novel was created in 2002 by Reki Kawahara, around the time when MMORPG were the craze. The anime like the name suggest is about a virtual world in a MMO. Akin to .hack//SIGN it¡¯s about a group of people being stuck inside a videogame (at least until the third volume where the game changes) where the only way to escape is to finish the game. The MC is a guy named Kirito who
                  meets various people along his adventure to the top of the tower where the key to completing the game lies. However, unlike .hack//SIGN, in SAO everything that could have done really well is destroyed. Now, let us get back to what the word bad means. It means it¡¯s not 'good in any manner or degree' according to dictionary.com and there many reasons for SAO to be bad. These reasons include overuse of cliches and overused tropes, bad characterization and that it exists as a self insert and wish fulfillment.
A major concern I have with SAO is the uses of cliches and overused tropes. One instance is the use of the well known clause in anime where Kirito said 'Do I have to use that?' in episode 9 when fighting a boss. This is one of the biggest cliche in anime and so bad that other shows mock shows using said cliche. In the scene where Kirito said that, there were players dying from the boss. This meant that Kirito let people die because he didn't other players to find out about his skill.
One of the things that I found extremely irritating about SAO was the fact that Kirito was the strongest in the SAO the game barring the admin. This is evident due to the fact that he is a BEATer (a portmanteau between the words BETA and cheater). Also, he has a unique skill where only two people in the game have. Not only was Kirito overpowered, his girlfriend Asuna is overpowered as well. This might be sexist but I find it hard to believe that a girl would be good at MMO (she is one of the highest leveled person in the game) when she has never played them before even if SAO is different from normal MMOs.
This brings in new questions. Why did the author make the main characters the strongest? This is due to self insertion and wish fulfillment. This is painfully obvious when plenty of pretty girls such as Sachi, Lizbeth, Silica and Asuna are lusting after his manhood and his personality is very similar to teenagers who have emo tendencies and antisocial behavior so they can relate to him. He is also later shown to be a massive nerd therefore pandering to computer geeks. Asuna is particularly the largest wish fulfillment girl I have ever seen. She possess incredible power like Kirito, is considered beautiful by pretty much everyone, excels in cooking both in game and in real life and comes from a wealthy family which are considered traits of a perfect girl. However, I personally hate her due to these facts.
The characterization is absolutely atrocious. First there are the main characters Kirito and Azuna as I mentioned before are terrible characters with terrible characterization. They have inconsistent personality such when Kirito suddenly changes from an emo kid to a happy going person between episodes and when Asuna suddenly becomes a tsundere. Also, characters such as Sachi and Lizbeth fall in love with Kirito even though they only knew him for few days. Even Asuna is guilty of this since she had sex with Kirito despite not knowing too much about him. The only good characters in the series are minor characters such as Silica and Klein. (Why couldn't they become the main characters? Klein as the MC would have made the show better.)
The pacing is also a major issue. There are just too many time skips in the anime. This makes the episodes too episodic and not have real plot. I am not saying that being episodic is bad but the episodes between 2-8 serve in no point in the plot other than being a side story. The anime would have been a lot better if it was pure comedic, slice of life MMO life about a guild instead of what it is now where it changed from sol to having an actual plot which neither of them were good.
The only really good aspect of the anime is the music, decent character design, animation and the setting was done well. It had Yuki Kajiura as the series composer who is one of my favourite composers and LiSA, another one of my favourite, as the singer for the opening. The setting for the anime is surprisingly good and is somewhat creative. The art wasn¡¯t anything special but was still one of the best aspect about the anime. Regardless, all of these were sadly all wasted on this bad anime.
Despite all I said, the worst part about SAO is the potential it had to be a good anime. It could have easily become my favourite anime if it was done right. It had the trapped in the video game trope which I quite like. In the end it doesn't even matter what I write since the anime will sell like hotcake. The fact that an anime with bad characterization, plot, and plenty of cliches is the most popular is telling that anime is dead. In MAL SAO is rated higher than Nodame, Tatami Galaxy and many other anime that are better than SAO. This is disappointing and I hope publishers do not start making similar anime to SAO just because it¡¯s popular just to make money.

                Scavenge. Slay. Survive.
This is what Sword Art Online should have been about. It should have been an anime that was a pure MMORPG in anime form, as it was made out to be. What did we get instead? 55% slice of life, 25% romance, 10% action, 10% plot. SAO is quite possibly the most overrated and overhyped anime I've ever come across in my anime years. SAO is highly regarded by its fans as one of the best Light Novels ever, better than Fate/Zero, Monogatari series, Haruhi series, Kara no Kyoukai, Welcome to the NHK and Baccano for a few examples. Granted, I haven't read
                  any of these works, but for some peculiar reason, I have an extremely hard time believing this. Why? Well, this will probably get me some flame for being biased, but because the anime is bad. Really bad. Now, some might say that it's because the adaptation of the anime is bad compared to the Novel, but I pretty much say bull. Even if that is the case, it still doesn't change the fact story is extremly generic and so far has nothing I couldn't get from watching .Hack//SIGN. If I don't like the plot and characters in the anime, I most certainately won't like them in the novel.
But enough with that... What exactly is it that makes me dislike this series so much that I would call it the most overrated and overhyped anime I've yet to come across? Let's begin.
Animation: ""The animation is fantastic and incredibly smooth every single scene! It looks absolutely beautiful!""
False. While I can agree that the animation is very good looking, it's not as beautiful and gorgeous as most people make it out to be. The setting is just another generic fantasy-like setting you've already seen before in oh so many anime before SAO. The artstyle is also very unfitting. What do I mean? Let me explain very short and simple - The anime is supposed to be serious and dark (keyword being supposed) yet the artstyle makes this world look like a fairy tale due to the bright colors and round character designs. And animation wise, as in movement, looks exactly like every other anime out there. The movements are just as stiff and movement-less as the anime next to it. The only times the animation is better than your average anime is when there's a fight going on, though the choreography in these fights are pretty boring. It's mostly just rushing towards the enemy and slashing away. They could've made the fights so much more enjoyable and interesting if they put more focus on making the fights more tactical and strategy heavy. 
The only thing I could give props for, creativly wise, is how sometimes we see from the player's POV. While this was nice the first time, this starts to get very repetitive as you get to see it in every episode and the fisheye style starts to annoy you more and more. Fortunately, this disappears about halfway and we never have to see it again. But wait... That was the only creative thing they did, and now it's gone. I don't know if I should complain or be happy. 
Even the less popular Ao no Exorcist which was also animated by A-1 Pictures was better animated than SAO in my opinion, even during the daily life events, and that one wasn't either extremly well animated. But that anime had much more interesting fights and looked a bit more flashy. Though that's to be expected seeing as that was a Shounen and this is a Seinen. Oh who am I kidding, SAO's obviously a Shounen.
Sound: ""The OST was composed by Kajiura Yuki! Instant awesomeness!""
Wrong. While I do love Kajiura Yuki, whom has done some amazing works in some earlier titles (most notably Kara no Kyoukai), this is definitely one of her weakest works yet. The soundtrack is so far lifeless and generic and has nothing special going on with it. For being an anime about an MMORPG, I sure as hell am not getting an MMO feeling while watching this anime. The soundtrack is so generic that I could take the entire OST and put it over any other fantasy anime, and no matter how great the anime is, I would still get the same generic feeling as I get while watching SAO. It does have some nice tracks and the OST can grow on you, but as I just said, this is definitely one of her weakest works and doesn't even come close to her works in anime such as Kara no Kyoukai, Madoka Magica and the previously mentioned .Hack//SIGN.
Voice cast wise, it's very mediocre. The voice cast is very bad at getting me entranced in the dialogues since it sounds like they are always reading straight from a script. Only some characters have proved the different, however, those characters were mostly just side characters that disappear as soon as they are introduced. It also doesn't help that all female characters speak in a typical cute way, further detracting the fact that this anime is supposed to be serious. 
Sound effect wise, it's good. It has everything you would expect from an anime that has a video game theme. Swords colliding, objects disappearing, slain enemies and menu sounds.
Story: ""The story just keeps getting better and better!""
Nope. Well, to give it credit, it did have a solid first episode and a nice premise. People are playing a Virtual video game which they cannot escape untill they defeat the final boss. And if they are killed in the game, they won't respawn, instead they die in real life aswell! That's pretty interesting. Just a damn shame that it all went down the toilet the further down the anime went with the story. For some reason, A-1 Pictures decided to animate the side stories in episodes 3-8 which severely slowed down the pace to the point where the anime got even more boring that fillers in Shounen anime! That's not very good storytelling if you ask me! I see no reason why they couldn't have just released these episodes on the BD/DVD volumes, as this would make the anime extremely more tolerable and have a much better pace. But, does it get better when the main plot starts again? Yes, but only for a short while (short while=one episode.) After this short while, the story gets boring and makes you care less about anything. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, so why the hell is the story not showing us this gruesome world where people die in real life if they are killed in the game? Instead, it focuses on the bad romance between Kirito and his ever growing harem, which we'll get to in the character section.
Speaking of the romance, if you ask me, this is what the anime is about. Not the plot, you know the whole being stuck inside a game premise, but instead the romance of our main characters. And while I do say that this is about being stuck inside an MMORPG and the objective is about escaping, this only counts for the first 14 episodes. After those episodes, SAO goes over to a very boring and very cliché damsel in distress story.
And how can I forget that SAO resorts to miracles for both of its two arcs' endings. Asspull miracles at that, since these things are never properly explained, or not explained at all.
Character: ""The characters are so believable! They are so full of life and relatable!""
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that is incorrect. For starters, Kirito, out main protagonist is supposed to made out as a shut-in gamer Otaku. Someone who is antisocial, in so many words. So since he is just that, it's obvious that he would play as a Solo Player since he prefers to be left alone. Right? Then tell me, why the hell is he going around helping and saving more people than I can count if he's supposed to be a Solo Player? Kirito was written as a Solo Player for the first 8 episodes, and yet he helps people out during ALL of these episodes! This is a 100% contridiction to how he was claimed to be and act. But hey, we need some romance in this survival story, right? So let's throw in multiple girls whom are all after Kirito's virtual penis. The only reason why Kirito is helping out mainly females is because he's just looking for someone to bone. He finally gets one girl who is willing to give up her virtual virginity to Kirito, Asuna. Well then, Kirito finally has a girl he can have some sweet romance with. Nope. The romance between Kirito and Asuna is one of the worst written romances I've come across in an action anime. They spend so little time actually together were they would show off romantic feelings to each other that it's impossible to believe that they actually love each other. They are the typical Tsundere-Shy guy combo that you always see nowadays. And don't get me started about what happens after the first half. Oh boy, that's when things go from bad to worse.
The character development is barely there, mainly because these characters change personality more often than Aizen trolls somebody in Bleach. But what about the side character? Well... They're barely even there! SAO introduces a lot of characters during the first half of the series, but 75% (random percentage) of all those either never appear again (until maybe a brief cameo in the last episode) or appear way too little. They focus so much on the main characters that you start to forget that the series even introduced more characters. Not good, yo. When you create characters you need to split up the development and screen time of side characters and main characters at a good ratio. Sure, the focus should be on the main characters, but it's also important to not forget about the side characters, as they can be a good way to develop the main characters.
Value: ""Best Light Novel ever!""
If this is what people would claim to be the best Light Novel of all frakking time, then I don't know what the hell people in their right mind are thinking. Because based on the anime, AND from what I've heard happens next, I see no reason why you would call it that since the novel seems to just keep going in circles and brings nothing new. If that is what people call A-Class writing, then I guess Kubo Tite is one of the best writers of all time.
And all the hate the series gets, this is your fault to blame. You, as in the ones who hyped this anime to be the most amazing thing ever produced. When you hype something as much as this one, you're risking damaging its overall appeal due to leading people into thinking that it's gonna be a masterpiece, only to be left extremely disappointed.
Enjoyment: ""Best Anime ever!""
This could have been one of the top anime of 2012, but ended up as one of the worst of the bunch because of bad directing and awful storytelling. If the series had focused more on the actual premise, this couldn've been a bit more interesting - however - the bad decision to put the side stories among the main episodes, the poorly written romance and the incredibly cliché plot (especially in its second half) makes SAO one hell of a drag to watch. It had its few moments, such as an interesting first episode, and a pretty okay episode 10. But the majority of the anime is nothing more than wish fullfillment and fan catering, appealing only to MMORPG players, teenagers and otaku.
Best anime ever my ass.
And now for my own enjoyment; where's that anime adaptation of Chapter 16.5?

"
                I've heard many things about SAO (Sword Art Online): There's either a lot of love or a lot of hate for it. Personally, I'm leaning a little towards the latter, but not fully on it. Before you start sending me hate mail or press the ""Not Helpful"" button, please hear me out.
As a gamer, and a fan of MMORPG's, I tried to keep my expectations not too high, because you know what they say: ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall"". Unfortunately, SAO fits this saying to a T, as it was one of the most disappointing anime that I've seen this year. Why?
                  Well, why do think I'm writing this forsaken review?!
~~~~~~
Story: (3/10)
The story of SAO involves players getting trapped within an VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game), in which they are required to beat all 100 floors of the game in order to leave. The catch is, however, that if a character's HP drops to zero before clearing the game, not only do they die in the game, they also die in real life. 
The concept of this story is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately, the execution of this story is poor. The writing and pacing is just awful. Even during the SAO arc of the show, while this was tolerable, I was left wondering, ""What on earth is happening here?"" The Alfheim arc, on the other hand, was just... I don't even want to describe it. Parts of Episodes 21 and 24 were just borderline unwatchable... (I'm not going to say which parts, just to avoid spoilers...) At least the ending was somewhat satisfying...
Overall, the story was just utter CRAP. A good premise at first, but was terribly executed due to poor writing.
~~~~~~
Characters: (2/10)
In my opinion, the characters of Sword Art Online were by far the weakest part of the show. The main male character, Kirito, is just a Gary Stu, and nothing more. But somehow, he has the ability to attract girls by just looking at them. Why are these girls attracted to him? I'll never know. The main female character, Asuna, was introduced in Episode 2 as a badass who I had high hopes for. And what happens with her? The writers decide to turn her into a generic tsundere, and in the Alfheim arc of the show, she basically turns into f**king Princess Peach. Suguha, other than being there for the sake of fanservice, and to be part of a love triangle that involved a little bit of incest (It didn't work for me in Elfin Lied, it doesn't work for me here...), pretty much served next to no purpose (In my eyes). And to go into deeper detail about Kirito and Asuna, I could not for the LIFE OF ME understand the romance with Kirito and Asuna. It felt so forced and plot-driven that it made me feel absolutely frustrated. 
However, I'd be lying if I didn't say that the reunion of Kirito (or Kazuto) and Asuna during the final episode was heartwarming... (but I digress).
The supporting characters were either uninteresting or just really annoying. The only character I had actual interest in was Klein, but even then, he was pretty much tossed aside. And as for Sugou, he is one of the worst villains I have ever seen. Period. He just absolutely disgusts me... (Though he has a certain line that's absolutely HILARIOUS!)
In the end, next to none of the characters were interesting or likeable in the slightest...
~~~~~~
Art/Animation: (10/10)
With my bitching and moaning aside, what DO I like in SAO? That's easy. I love how it looks. The art in this show is absolutely beautiful. From the scenery to the action scenes, the animation is consistent and fluid, and the scenery is just gorgeous. Maybe it's the fact that graphics/art is one of the major things I look into within a video game, but I digress.
With animation, this anime hits a perfect bullseye.
~~~~~~
Music: (8/10)
Since I'm not a person to critique VA, I'll just talk about the music. Just like the art, I also really enjoyed the music of Sword Art Online (and because I'm a fan of Yuki Kajiura). It reminded me of the countless hours I used to spend on MapleStory leveling up my character. The first opening, ""Crossing Fields"", got me pumped for an episode; giving me SOME hope that the show would somehow redeem itself (Sadly, it didn't).
Nevertheless, the music was as good as the art!
~~~~~~
Enjoyment: (4/10)
While I did enjoy Sword Art Online in the beginning, progressing through it turned into more of a chore than an enjoyment. Most of the SAO arc was ""meh"", and the Alfheim arc was just painful to watch. If it wasn't for the action scenes, this would've been rated MUCH lower.
~~~~~~
Overall Score: 5.4 out of 10 (Rounded down to 5)
In my honest opinion, Sword Art online was just painfully average. While the art and music are amazing, the story and characters prevent the show from being anything memorable (At least for me). Like I said before, it is definitely one of the most disappointing anime I have seen this year. Although it's not a 1 in my eyes, it's also not a 10.
Was it worth the hype? No.
Will I watch it again? Probably not.

                *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
Sword Art Online is a pioneer of its genre in that, the source material dates from all the way back in 2002 (.hack// being of the same vintage).  This is important to note as with all pioneering feats, there is an initial sense of wonder and hype, followed by disappointment as the same concept is refined and improved upon.   To give an example, the Victorians pioneered the underground railway in London, a marvel at its time but it was soon realised that they dug the tunnels too small.  The tiny, overcrowded trains of today cannot be appreciated for
                  its breakthrough in technology.  SAO, due to its nature therefore shows the same seemingly obvious flaws that only become apparent in hindsight.
With that said, SAO is a fantastic piece of work considering how the author was only a high school student at the time, and how he ventured into previously unexplored territory.   The author and the subsequent adaptation by A1 pictures successfully manages to impress the intended audience; the teenage market.  This is done through a careful blend of adventure, cliffhangers , pacing, deux es machinas and a good cast of girls.
The show starts off with a highly interesting premise with players in a perfectly modelled virtual reality.  Since their consciousness is surrendered to the NervGear hardware, the only way to return to the real world is through the “Log Out” button which has unfortunately gone walkies.  We follow the life events of our protagonist, Kirito as he battles his way through his ups and downs, which is not limited to fighting.
Kirito also faces a daunting challenge emotionally, as the stakes are exceptionally high.  A death in-game equates to death in real life.  These obstacles flesh out the human nature of Kirito’s character in great detail.  His behaviour, emotions and actions are closely related to his recent happenings and experiences.  Kirito starts off as a social recluse who prefers to limit his interactions with other people.  This leads him to shun the cooperative nature of MMORPGs and plays solo.  Through a chance encounter, Kirito manages to befriend a group and re-learn the significance of friendship and comradeship, and how that improves his mental well-being.  This does not lead to the unrealistic result of Kirito becoming instantly socially adept, as he faces further obstacles and setbacks that push him back to his reclusive old self.  Such flaws truly show that Kirito is simply a mere mortal with variable emotions and feelings, which serves to connect with the viewer with empathy.  For Kirito is only the strongest player in SAO due to his effort and research, rather than simply being perfect.  Only through real experience can Kirito grow as a person, and the growth is closely tied in with the story.
A1 Pictures is to be commended for only highlighting the most significant parts of Kirito’s story as he fights to clear the game.  Thousands of hours of level-grinding which was normal in the Everquest era of 2002 (when SAO was written) has given way to achievement caps relating to the hours you play in a day in 2012 (when SAO was adapted).  To put it in simpler terms, the firms that make MMORPGs implementing such caps means the community has democratically voted with their wallets that level grinding is far too troublesome and boring.
We are therefore treated to relevant side stories instead of level-grinding filler.  Each of these side stories involves an encounter with a supporting cast with wide variations in personalities and nature of the quest.  Through the use of variety in the story, not only do we get to see Kirito develop, but also the world.  The viewer is introduced to the world of MMORPGs involving Guilds, Raids, Smithing, Conspiracy and even a compelling virtual romance that becomes the foundation of a timely rejuvenation of Kirito’s character.  Relationships however, are a two-way street and Asuna’s (the main heroine and Kirito’s girlfriend) worldview is also seamlessly influenced, and improved.  The two-way nature of the relationship really makes it convincing, and leaves a lasting impression.  The end product is an Asuna, despite her obvious flaws as a human, becomes a character whom many would look up to, due to her dedicated and faithful nature that was born out of hardship.
All of the above really shows that the writers performed an exceptional job.  The accurate portrayal of the fickle nature of human emotions, and especially during the tumultuous years of adolescence really brings the show to life.  The level of language, and the tones used by the voice actors were highly appropriate.  They successfully avoid Kirito sounding like an aged professor with a PhD in SAO, and a realistic mix of rational decision making and emotionally-charged angst is used.
The quality of writing continues with the way the villains are portrayed.  The first major villain, Kayaba is an accurate rendition of the genius, lost in his own world, which he seeked to control.  He is the prime example of a person termed as a sociopath.  The best aspect of him however is not his character itself, but the way he integrated himself into the storyline, and produced the most unexpected plot twist.  This twist is a very crafty, and convincing one due to it being totally out of the blue yet in hindsight, perfectly plausible.
The second villain, Sugou on the other hand, is the purest example of a villain in recent times.  Villains are meant to be bad, but not all can be successful at being bad and unique at the same time.  A recent, highly successful example to compare is Raoul Silva, the highly-acclaimed villain in James Bond’s Skyfall.  Not only was Silva bad, he was amusingly bad and obviously received pleasure from just being plain ‘badass’.  In SAO, Sugou betters Silva by not only bringing amusement, but also the purest feeling of disgust against the character.  In essence, Sugou is the victim of his own success, and the show goes to great extent by detailing his personality and motives.  The icing on the cake is when Sugou subjects Asuna to the unthinkable, further solidifying the author and A1’s innovative risk-taking with the series.
Although show is somewhat lacking in all-out battle action which comes across as strange, due to its highly suggestive title; the art of swordcraft,  the worry is misplaced.  The rarity of such scenes only serves to enhance the excitement during the boss battles.  The immersion is further exemplified by the convincing use of light effects during animated scenes.  This highly appropriate use of animation technique serves to amplify the effect of each, and every single hacking and slicing motion.  Instead of Diablo-style hack and slice spamming, we are treated with the significance of each motion.  A1 Pictures have clearly taken on board the mantra of quality over quantity.
Unfortunately, following the mantra means the show tried to cover too much, in too little time.  An attempt at too much quality in too little time.  SAO attempts to provide a realistic and varied portrayal of the world of MMOGs.  They have unfortunately made the pioneer’s mistake of being far too ambitious.  Some characters are casted a little too far to the side and that includes those that greatly influenced Kirito’s development being one-episode wonders.  This is especially evident in the ‘Aria’ sub-arc where A1 Pictures attempted to cover too much ground in a single episode when Asuna was introduced.  Nevertheless, while this may seem detrimental, the flip side is of course, the less intrusive nature of the side cast.  This approach avoids the trap of character bloat which other series have fallen into.  Despite the blunder with ‘Aria’, Asuna gets the focus she needs later in the series.
The excellent writing and animation is greatly amplified by the renowned composer, Kajiura Yuki who worked on the music.  The style of the music resembles her most recent previous work (Fate/Zero), but is sufficiently different to set it apart, reminiscent of the time she worked on  Mai-HiME and Tsubasa Chronicles back-to-back.  She forgoes her usual techno, and instead utilizes a greater reliance on classic instruments and the orchestra.  A highly appropriate decision as the art of swordsmanship and the resulting swordfights are traditional in nature.  Despite classical instruments being rather ‘soft’ in comparison with electronic music, Kajiura delivered beautifully with the softer style actually multiplying the effectiveness of the battle scenes.  Her mix of opera in the battle tracks only serves to give a sense of ‘epic’, seen in the likes of “The Lord of the Rings”.
It is important at this point to mention that SAO actually has two, highly distinct arcs.  The second arc is not a death game, but a race against time.  It also gives a much-needed change in pace from the seriousness that hung over the first arc.  Unfortunately, the benefits of a slightly light-hearted arc is also its downfall.  The sense of urgency from the race against time was not portrayed in the best manner, with Kirito taking seemingly pointless detours, which in actuality was in fact, perfectly reasonable.  A1 Pictures disappointed in this regard, disconnecting the viewer with the character’s decision-making.  Nevertheless, the detours sets the foundations of Kirito developing in the real world, and explores his relationship with people that are the closest to him.  Aside from the minor drawback, the quality of writing is still very good (but not excellent) and the quality of animation and music is maintained.
All in all, the excellence of the individual components (e.g. sound, animation) come together at the end to give the viewer an anime that is pleasant to see, awe-inspiring to hear, and minds in intrigue with the story.  A1 Pictures has successfully created an adaptation that entertains a wide variety of audiences.  SAO is a must watch for fans of adventure, fantasy, romance and even harem.  Even the detractors derived a whole new level of entertainment, expressed in forms not limited to reaction videos on YouTube.  The product’s success is clearly seen through pure, objective evidence by means of Blu-Ray sales as viewers have overwhelmingly embraced SAO.
Overall, SAO gets an excellent 9/10.  A truly enjoyable series that crosses an extremely wide range of anime fanbases which is no mean feat.  It is probably fair to deduct a single point in light of the slight weakness in ‘Aria’ and in the second arc but not any more than that due to the amount of ground that required covering in order to complete Kirito’s development.
Now that I’ve mentioned ‘Aria’, there is another anime of the same name.  This series must never be watched, for it involves girls simply rowing boats for 3 whole seasons.  Worst of all, a ‘moeblob’ (in other words, ‘moe[brown stuff]’) loli character is introduced, being evidenced by her having an S-tier Zettai Ryouiki.  The wise community must avoid such monstrosity going after easy cash and stick to shows of a deep and profound nature, such as SAO.",9

                |This review contains minor spoilers of the shitty story and characters|
Oh Sword Art Online, how you fooled millions of people into thinking that this show will be every gamer and anime fans' dream-come-true. We all came in, watched the first episode and thought "" This actually looks pretty cool "" , and continued watching like fish on a fishing rod. How wrong were we? Well, I will tell you, fellow readers, how the anime that received one of the largest fan-bases in recent times, holds the pinnacle of the word 'Overrated '; and I will do my best to convince you to NOT watch this
                  anime.
Story: 2
Now let's begin this review with discussing about the 'gripping' story, that led such a large fan-base into picking up SAO. So, I am not going to talk about the synopsis, as MAl has it displayed at all times, but I have to say that 'disappointment' is an understatement when describing the story of this anime. The biggest disappointment when watching this anime was the colossal time-skips that the anime takes. At one moment Kirito (the main character of the series) is a weakling, and literally in the blink of an eye, he is the most over-powered in the game. Thus, character-development is thrown out of the window. You just can't bring out a realistic and gripping story with such decisions. 
The other fact that made the story ridiculous, was the fact that Kirito simply levels so fast by PLAYING ALONE in a bloody MMORPG. If you have played at least 1 game of this genre, you would be highly aware that this is further than impossible, as you would need at least 100 players to beat a boss, of which all players must be very highly leveled. Thus the story becomes so poor and unrealistic, that it is almost hilarious.
The first arc of SAO, which consists of the first 15 episodes, in terms of story overall, was terrible. There were time-skips and an unrealistic story. However, were the story becomes even more ridiculous is the second arc, which consists of the rest of the story. A damsel-in-distress is again, an understatement. You all should be fully aware of the video-game franchise 'Mario'. Kirito is Mario and Asuna (which I will talk about how awful of a character she is in my character section of this review), is princess Peach. And i am not exaggerating at all. This becomes so annoying, that watching this series, I remember wanting to bash my head against the wall to ease my fury. Oh wait, there's more! Ever wanted to see a character in a non-ecchi anime being 'done' by tentacles? Well this is the anime for you! Cause I am sure that all the kids that watched this series, thinking that it would be like a Disney film ended up getting rather scarred.
The last factor that determines my score of '2' is the slice-of-life elements of the show, that tricked the whole audience of the show into thinking that this anime would be consisted of badass action sequences and a complex story. No. Instead, what we get is two idiots telling how much they love each other (even though they met in a game) for most of the series with little to no action. Enjoy.
Character: 1
Oh you thought that I was telling the worst about this anime, were you? Well don't worry, it gets much worse in this section. To put it simply, the characters in this series are laughable, generic, idiotic and extremely one-dimensional. I will talk about some of the characters of the series.
1. Kirito: So what do you get when you mix Makoto from school Days and every other generic protagonist from a harem series, combined with a bit retardation. You get Kirito of course! This guy is living a harem with 5 girls in this series, for absolutely no reason at all. The girls are treated like mindless retards that the only thing that pleases them is a douche like Kirito because of black hair and clothes. This guy is worse than a regular, clueless male lead from a harem series as he does not only understand the situation he finds himself in, but also does not give a shit. He dumps all he rest of the women (including side-chicks) and guess who he decides to go with in the end; HIS FUCKING SISTER. Yes, this anime is incestuous beyond belief. Kirito is the epitome of everything I hate in an anime character combined.
2. Asuna: This chick is the one which receives the worst development (of almost all) of anime i have seen . She starts off looking like a cool female lead, with a large potential of evolution, and then, all of the sudden, she enters a part of Kirito's harem with what seems like so reason at all. She did not give a damn about Kirito, and then instantly wants his D, after sleeping on a field with him, for whatever reason that is.
The relationship of Asuna and Kirito is not only extraordinarily unrealistic, but also dreadful, as this relationship is seen to be so forceful. |SPOILERS| They end up adopting this one girl they find in the woods, and this is when the characters become so BAD. This father-daughter and mother-daughter relationship is so off from real life it's funny. The end up wasting most of the first arc with deciding whether to keep this girl or not (of which destroys the genres of this series wholly) and makes you think this show is a pathetic Clannad rip-off.
The rest of the characters in this series are so forgettable I have forgotten most of their names as a result. The girls are shown to be whores with no wit, while the antagonists of the show are BEYOND HILARIOUS. The main antagonist of the series has NO purpose to trap this people in this world and kill them off. NO reason at all. This guy simply wants to look evil for no ulterior purpose, because this show needs a reason to exist.
In the end, the characters receive little to no development, while proving to the audience that ' the power of friendship' exists in a couple such as Kirito and Asuna, as the romance is so bad in this series, that it feels like Asuna gets friend-zoned by Kirito for wants to jump his sister, which she was the worst character of all. For absolutely no reason at all, this girl wants to bang her brother (which the anime makes statements here and there stating that they are cousins living in the same house, which is still nonsensical). And Kirito falls for her because his motto is "" THE BIGGER THE TITS THE BETTER "".
Animation and Art : 8
I have to give credit to A-1 pictures for producing an anime that has decent-looking colors, and a fair amount of frames within the little battle-sequences this anime holds. The art however is nothing that spectacular as to up the score any more than it already is, as an anime which received such a massive audience deserved a greater production value, in my opinion. The background are usually fairly done, and there is no real lack of consistency when dealing with the anime as a whole.
Sound: 9
Yuki Kajiura is an amazing composer and I feel that her music really fit the atmosphere of the show. It's a shame that she wasted her efforts in such a show like this, but whatever. The openings are both fantastic, with greater emphasis to the first one, "" Crossing Field "" which really suited the tone of the anime itself, combined with an excellent chorus.
As a lot of anime, the voice-acting of SAO was on-par and did their job very well (with reference to the original Japanese dub), so whatever part i had to take seriously, I did due to the well executed emotions portrayed through words. Again, its a shame that they bothered to do such a good job on an anime like this.
Enjoyment: 3
I tried to enjoy this show, I really did. But I could not take it seriously due to the harem, ecchi and incestuous nature of the show itself. The characters clearly lacked any substance and the story was laughable, thus further lowering my enjoyment of the show. The only facts that upped my enjoyment, was the fantastic opening, that made me want to watch each episode for that purpose. The animation made me enjoy the anime a bit more as well, but all these do not compensate with the sheer horror of the show's execution.
Overall: 3
Of course, the animation/art and sound only play for a small part of the overall score. The story and characters were anything below pathetic, and thus could not credit the show itself. Please, do yourself a favor and skip this entry, it is not worth your time at all. Don't get fooled by the popularity of the show itself, as that is not an indication of how good the show is, instead proves how many souls were lost in wasting their time on an anime like this.
Thanks for reading my review! RedInfinity out.",3
"
                Remember back in July I said that seeing the hype, this would probably become the next Guilty Crown? Well, reflecting on that now…I would like to sincerely apologize…to the Guilty Crown fans because Sword Art Online is nowhere near Guilty Crown’s level in terms of visuals and soundtrack. 
As we all know, studio A-1 is not known for action based anime. Most of their signature works are slice of life romantic comedies. The character designs are reminiscent of those in Working!! despite the fact that this show markets itself as a serious action fantasy series. Action scenes heavily utilized flash frames in order to cut
                  corners. Most of the time, the viewers are just shown the expressions of the characters instead of what is actually happening to the scene as a whole. In some instances, frames from previous episodes were even reused. Saying that the visuals were underwhelming is an understatement. 
The music department is one of the few redeeming qualities of this show although this is perhaps Kajiura’s most lackluster work in recent years. Some parts of soundtracks seem recycled right out of her recent works. Not to mention that sometimes, the music does not fit that particular scene. To put it simply, the music was nice, but lacks soul.
Up until now, we’ve covered the visuals and the music. Both aspects are mediocre at worst and are not bad enough to garner the negativity towards this show. So what went wrong? Well, obviously the leftover parts: the plot and the characters. 
Truth be told, the premise of the story had potential. However, that raw potential was untouched and on top of that, was marred by absolutely horrid execution in terms of storytelling and progression. An easy phrase to apply here is “show, not tell”. Several backstory filler episodes were carelessly dumped into the beginning of the series giving the impression that the writers didn’t care enough to put in the effort in order to integrate those side stories nicely into the series. To add insult to injury, those episodes were rushed. It’s pretty ridiculous how the progression would have seemed smoother and more acceptable if the content was cut. And as the viewer continue watching, the story becomes a mass of plotholes rampant with tasteless fanservice that are randomly thrown in; In particular, the breaking of game mechanics written in cold, hard code at the convenience of the main characters which will be covered in the next section. Again, this is just very contradictory considering the fact that this show is trying to get viewers to take it seriously. You really have to wonder if the writers have forgotten that this is supposed to be a story about an MMORPG.
Now we come to the last nail in the coffin: characters. Overpowered main characters are not uncommon and there are generally no problems if they are done well. Sword Art Online, unfortunately, did not handle this trope with expertise and fell into the trap where the main character bends plot more than gravity stretches time. Kirito is a walking deus ex machina. He can do and experience things that are impossible according to previously shown game mechanics. His personality and traits also changes according to the situation such as being a fumbling idiot one moment yet two minutes later he is soloing mobs while spitting out cheesy phrases from some Clint Eastwood movie. He simply does not leave a lasting impression other than his role and abilities in the story. Take away his dual wielding abilities and what do you remember him for? Nothing. On top of that, the story gives no sense of excitement due to his overpowering presence. The viewer does not feel pressured to known what’s going to happen next since it’s a given that Kirito will resolve the situation with no problems. Asuna, on the other hand, was introduced as a strong capable female but turned into a damsel in distress under the influence of Kirito’s plot wielding; eventually becoming a fap fodder waifu character. What’s also not helping the cast is that there are no significant characters other than the main characters. Side characters are pretty much irrelevant given their almost nonexistent character development. It’s almost as if they are taking on an episodic approach to the characters despite the fact that this story is supposedly linear with a clear objective or ending in mind.
The final verdict? A three out of ten. This is taken into account the fact that I've changed into a masochist and this show has given me enjoyment and gratification with it's absolutely tortuous delivery. You really have to wonder if fans of this show love the premise of the series or the series itself. Perhaps this show would have done better if it chose a simply fantasy setting instead since it obviously wasn’t adeptly incorporating elements of an MMORPG. In the end, Sword Art Online is a show that can present the who, what, when, and where with efficiency but fails completely to explain how and why I should bother giving a tiny rat’s ass.",3

                Story-
Sword Art Online (SAO) had real promising from reading the synopsis; however, I feel that it failed to delivery on all the hype it was getting. But after watching several episodes I feel like SAO has two major issues which make the anime really hard and jarring to get into. These two problems are the Story and the Characters.  The story starts off with the premise that players are trapped within the game, SAO, and the only way to get out is to clear all 100 levels. But the problem here, with the story, is that the anime tends to skip months at a
                  time, which is very jarring as a view. It felt as if I missed out of entire events from watching one episode to another. 
The story, though 11 episodes, hasn't really gone anywhere aside from the main characters fighting bosses and proceeding through the levels, but the main problem is that there is no ""main"" villain per say. And what I mean is that we don't really see a villain (can be argued that the game is the main villain, but I don't think that this was intended).  This bothers me personally, I like to see who is pulling the strings or at least some hint of someone behind everything. Sure we saw the creator in episode one, but after that he is never mention again, as of yet. So I've given the story a lower score because it just seems to not be going anywhere and because of skipping so much time.
3/10
Art-
Characters look great, sets look great, different levels have different art styles, and they all look great. Not much more to say here.
8/10
Sound-
I really loved the music in SAO, I felt like it harmonized well with the different levels worked well during the fight scenes. Enjoyed the music.
8/10
Character(s)-
There are really only two main characters that we see on a regular basis and the problem is, well, they're pretty boring. There is no real development for our main hero and heroine because they've skipped so much time in the anime and we're not given time enough to get to know and like these characters. I think that the relationship between the two are rushed and is hard to believe. They are too perfect and have no flaws or interesting traits to them, basically they're two dimensional and have no depth to them. 
2/10
Overall I think that the story and characters really dragged down SAO from being what it was hyped to be. And the problems are so huge that it's hard to over look them and enjoy the anime. From the time skipped, months at a time, I felt very disconnected from the world they presented because I felt as if I missed so much. So it's hard for me to really give SAO a good score because I believe it had great potential and premise. But overall I would give SAO a 4/10 for the problems mention above.",4

                I heard all this hype about Sword Art Online. Any anime site worth its salt has heard of it. It's vaunted as one of the best animes of 2012, and I heard pretty good stuff about it! However if there's one rule about anime is that the more hyped it is, the more crushing when it turns out to be a disappointment. SAO is one of these.
It started out with an interesting premise: ten thousand people are locked into a virtual reality game, with no law or order. They must beat the game in order to get out. At the forefront is Kirito, a skilled
                  player and one of the original players of the game. It sounds good on paper.
The issue with this is that Kirito is a borderline Gary Stu. He's the Ace, the secret weapon of the players, and all the player's hopes rides on his shoulders. Okay, apart from being a typical sounding shonen hero, that isn't anything special. What IS, however, is that he picks up a LOT of skills that become more and more often deus ex machinas. He steals the spotlight from every other character so everyone else, even our female protagonist, Asuna, can only stare in awe off to the side. 
Asuna went from a powerful, pretty awesome character to the love interest that every anime requires. Her powers and skills as co-leader of the best guild in the game gradually dwindle until she's little more than a plot point. The romance between the two is nonexistent, despite it being praised as one of the anime's strongest points. If this is supposed to be the strongest point, I'm glad I didn't exactly go into this with high expectations. I'm not sure the author knew how romance works and that this was wish fulfillment. News flash guys, girls don't hang out with you, eat with you for a few episodes, and then decide they want to marry you. That doesn't happen.
The other characters, especially the female characters, all fall in love with Kirito. Why? I don't know; it isn't revealed. It's as if just being there is enough to charm everyone in sight. That was where I started dreading turning on my computer to watch this awful excuse for a romantic drama. They're shallow, one-dimensional, and bring little to no depth to the storyline whatsoever. They're only purpose is to long after Kirito, making it seem like a poorly written harem story.
The story is awful, despite having a strong premise. Go up a hundred floors (most of these aren't even shown), beat the boss, leave the game. Okaaay... what about leveling? Or getting better equipment? Interactions between guilds? Friendly duels? Anything NORMAL that you'd expect from an MMORPG? Nope, none of that is present, with the exception of illegal duels which eventually becomes murder cases (Kirito solves these, by the way). 
The art is just... meh. It wasn't extraordinary and honestly looks like something I'd see out of a dime-a-dozen manga from 2006. No effects really seemed to catch my eye, and the scenery was just average. I expected more from a 2012 anime. 
Sound? It does have a pretty nice opening, and the soundtrack is also nice, so if that's your thing, go for it. However, it's simply not enough to bring to the table. I had to force myself after episode fourteen to find episode fifteen and watch it. 
SAO is over-hyped. It  didn't live up to half the expectations I set, and I set pretty low standards. It's the perfect example of wish fulfillment to the highest degree.",3
"
                Yes! Yeeees! Oh, let me taste your tears, Asuna! 
Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet!
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! Yummy~
In a world where series' like Harry Potter, or other real abhorrent fanfiction tittles the likes of Twilight sells well enough for multiple sequels, it shouldn't be a surprise then, Sword Art Online's popularity skyrocketing that is. Pretty posters, familiarity, perhaps male power fantasies and the like, etc. There are numerous factors that play a part in a works' popularity; but it's hard to pin-point just what exactly got SAO such hype. Especially since it becomes apparent that it was already losing it's
                  focus just after the third episode. In a similar vein to SAO's sister in terms of popularity still that very same year, Guilty Crown also had an (ostensibly) enormous fanbase even before it aired. It's a mystery really. 
SAO is a clear indication that it's target audience are easy to profit from. Which is exactly why it makes it just the kind of anime that makes you wonder about where the anime industry could be heading. It is not a positive influence. And unfortunately for the supporters, SAO does provide with more than enough empirical evidence to tell them that it is garbage but, that would be unfair as there actually is entertainment value to be had here.
In the visual department SAO definitely excels, maybe not enough to make a graphic artist have wet dreams over, though. From the character designs to the very world which they reside in, it is all aesthetically pleasing. And while consistent and fluid in it's animation, it's a little rough around the edges during the fight scenes. There's an abuse of stills to express 'action', and distorted facial expressions used in an otherwise uneventful location (was that actually intended to be used for comedic effect? Welp). Of course, this alone wouldn't damper the experience. If everything else were intact, this would remain relatively unnoticed. 
An interesting concept? A Charismatic main character? world building? SAO had just about everything working in it's favor to make it anime of that year. But even with the few legitimate merits it has it does away with them in favor of, well, to make our hero The Black Swor- wait, no one actually confuses to whom that tittle belongs to, right..? - Kirito, more of a flawless gary stu. 
All complete with enough deus ex-machinas to make you puke.
Thousands of players dying? All off-screen and no one gives a crap about statistics. Boss fights? Essentially, a grand total of three and they don't re-spawn.You never really get a sense of dread in the world of SAO. Even the very first death was due to a player refusing to take a life potion. And that's all in the first half of the series. The second half? Not even going to touch it. Unless, of course, we're talking about Suguha's sugus here.
And as you can imagine, with it taking itself so seriously already, when it come to the uh... romance the end result is laughable. Later on, at one point Asuna said something around the lines of, ""Kirito has changed me, everything I am as it is now is because of him"". I started to cringe at that point, none of what she said happened. The characterization suffers almost as much as the writing; or vice versa. Every villain is cartoonishly evil and every supporting character doesn't fair any better either. All of the 'character development' happens during the constant time skips, successfully nullifying it and making for a heavily disjointed pacing. And It doesn't help that the script is akin to that of an eroge. Meaning: A) relationships take on a surrealistic fast pace. B) can't hear a confession a foot away from you. C) Being nice is enough to attract females from all corners of the land, etc.
SAO could very well be suggesting you to be a Infidelity-committing, sister-fornicating, misogynistic pedophile who loves rape as fanservice. Topped only by those slimy tentacles everyone likes. -- It doesn't encourage anything positive, it's too delusional to do so. All the gamer pandering, multiple relationships, etc. It only serves to further take away any sense of realism it might have had, including it's potential to construct a society within a virtual world; firmly planting it into wish-fulfillment territory. 
Splendorous action - this is the only reason I can think of as to why I would recommend this show. And yet, despite all that, knowing that it falls off the rails, crashes and burns; it get's back on the tracks again, and again only to end up crashing. 
It's fun, if only to mock it.",3

                I might as well skip the plot synopsis of Sword Art Online, because odds are you already know it. Sword Art Online has utterly exploded. It is all over the place. It is that one show the EVERYONE is watching, whether it be through genuine interest or sheer bile fascination. And amidst this, it has split the anime fandom enormously between those who utterly love it and those who absolutely hate it. As you no doubt checked what I scored this before anything else, you can probably tell I'm in the latter camp.
In the event that you've been living under a rock these past 6
                  months, Sword Art Online revolves around an online game that allows full immersion, that all of it's players soon become trapped in via the classic ""you die here, you die in the real world"" plot device. All the game's players are now trapped in a brutal survival game, as per a ton of other anime that you have doubtlessly watched at least one of before. SAO's first and most obvious fault even to someone who hasn't watched it would be that the premise is incredibly generic - it's just a cobbling-together of Mirai Nikki and .Hack, amongst others, and neither were very good to start with.
But for all my complaints with the series SAO scrapped itself together from, at least those series bothered with a coherent narrative. SAO's story is an inconsistent and appallingly-paced trainwreck, jumping through numerous ill-placed timeskips and sudden shifts in the style of the story in a way that is, to make an understatement of it, very jarring.
The series goes through several stages. The first is confined to episode 1, AKA the only good episode. It serves to set up the plot, and does a decent enough job of it. However, rather than following said plot, it quickly switches to episodic journeys through the world our protagonist is trapped in. In theory that isn't such a terrible idea, but any promise it had is ruined by drearily slow pacing, and more importantly, the most mind-numbingly flat Gary Stu viewer self-insertion blank slate of a protagonist you could possibly imagine. His sole character trait is that he is an extremely powerful player (worse yet, any development into such a powerful player happens offscreen).
Around the episode 9 mark, the actual plot starts to take place. Kirito, the aforementioned dullard emotion-bot protagonist, befriends Asuna, a similarly one-dimensional fellow player he met in an earlier episode, and through a series of events is dragged into joining her guild, who plan to take on the final boss of SAO. In the process of this, the two become romantically involved. Sorry, did I say the plot happened here? My mistake, it actually gets thrown out the window at the first hint of romance. The whole ""escaping SAO"" plot is put on hold for several episodes while Kirito and Asuna's romantic ""subplot"" takes over. This doesn't seem that bad until you remember that Kirito and Asuna are totally one-dimensional. Fittingly enough, their romance feels forced and completely fake. How they even ""fall in love"" is totally ignored - they just do.
Eventually, they get a move on with the damned plot, and *SPOILER ALERT* - everything comes to an extremely rushed and sudden conclusion (especially jarring due to how drearily slow everything was before), and they manage to beat SAO, in spite of some major leaps of logic involving how it actually happened. At last, everyone can escape this wretched game, and continue with their lives. Happy ending!
...Wait a tick. Why are there still 11 episodes left?
""Oh right, there's still good money to make off this series. We can't end it just yet! Let's draw it out a bit longer... I dunno, pull some bullshit subplot out of nowhere. Just make some stuff up.""
In a nutshell, Sore Arse Online managed to drag itself out. Another online game, Alfheim Online, manages to get involved in the plot, using some leftover technology from SAO. Kirito has to enter this game as well, along with his sister (who is actually his cousin, which somehow makes the romantic siscon undertones not as bad).
...OK, I'll stop now. Anyway, the most generous thing I can say about his sister is that unlike Kirito and Asuna, she at least has a personality. For better or worse, since her personality is that of a completely insufferable melodramatic whining brat. She's not the only terrible character introduced in this arc, though... we also get the villainous mastermind behind Alfheim Online, who starts off overly and campily evil and just keeps getting more heinous from there. At every opportunity, the series will remind you that he is evil in new and terrible ways. You will quickly get the point, but SAO will keep shoving it down your throat. Even his eventual comeuppance is more uncomfortable than cathartic.
So there's SAO in four parts. It's an uneven, shifting, poorly-planned mess. It's characters are awful. It's plot is awful. It's pacing is awful. Short of it's decent production job, everything in SAO is awful.
I highly recommend you stay offline.
That pun was awful.

                This is a review of Sword Art Online’s adaptation. I do not care for the light novels, this review is based entirely on the anime adaptation. 
The Story (4/10)
The plot for this anime falls below that of an average seasonal anime. Sword Art Online begins with a good, interesting premise. The first two episodes are actually very promising. However, once you get past those initial episodes the show doesn’t really do anything of interest and feels like it was written by a sexually frustrated teenager. As I said, the concept is good and somewhat tragic. A new virtual reality MMO opens up and thousands of
                  players begin grinding away, only to find they cannot log out of the game and are stuck in this virtual world. There are so many possibilities and interesting things to be done with this premise. Sadly, it’s all wasted. Forced romance, time skips, filler and a random love triangle plague this anime.
It’s not that the story is dreadful, it’s just that it was incredibly mediocre when there was so much to be done with it. Disappointing. And that’s without mentioning the second half of the series, which is legitimately awful. Seriously, if you are going to waste your time on this show for whatever reason, just drop it when you get to the halfway point. You’ll know when you’re there. There’s a load of bullshit, Gary Sue, rule-breaking nonsense. I could go on all day, but then I’d have to give actual spoilers.
Art and Animation (8/10)
Very solid, actually. High production value and nothing to complain about really. Other than the fact that this decently-sized budget was wasted on a terrible show. 
Sound (7/10)
Ahh, Kajiura Yuki. A shame his time was wasted on this tripe. Honestly, it’s not one of his best works. It fit the on-screen stuff but nothing really stood out. The first opening by LiSA is great, however. Possibly the best thing to come of this series. 
Characters (2/10)
Nope, nope, nope. I can deal with silly characters like Yui from K-On. I can deal with whiney characters like Shinji. But the whole point of this main character is wish fulfilment. He’s a self-insert; an antisocial, somewhat pathetic, MMO playing teenager. I’m not sure if they were trying to make a character as close to the intended audience as possible, but they damn well succeeded. He’s then somehow amazing and brilliant at the game purely because he did some beta testing. In fact, he even defies the rules of the game. The hard-coded rules matter not to this Gary Sue! He also becomes some sort of courageous leader, somehow. He changes in the series but there’s no character development. He just kind of decides to be different. 
Now for the female cast. I’m sorry, but how is this loser surrounded by attractive young women? Why are so many attractive young women even on this game? Way to ruin any suspension of disbelief. The female lead, Asuna, was perhaps the one character with some potential. Unfortunately, just like the premise of this show, the potential goes to waste and they turn what should have been a strong female lead into a damsel in distress. 
Conclusion (4/10)
This series is below what I’d consider average, even with the high production value. If the second cour never happened this might have been above average for me, but the latter half was just too awful. If you are the target audience for this show (a teenage male who enjoys playing MMOs) then you may very well like this series. It is watchable, and some episodes are pretty good. Think of this as the Twilight of anime; there are occasional good moments, but to actually enjoy the whole thing you need to be a specific type of person. 
I would not recommend this show to anyone outside of the aforementioned target audience. Those people will probably love this series, but to everyone else you’ll probably feel that you’ve wasted your time. Good premise ruined by childish wish fulfilment.",4

                I heard of Sword Art Online from almost every single anime media when it released. People were singing praises about this apparently highly anticipated anime. Going in expecting an enjoyable experience, I was completely let down. SAO is probably the most overrated anime so far
Both the art and sound were done extremely well, as expected from such a high budget anime. 
Being a gamer myself, i was intrigued by the story, but it was terribly executed.
To me, the characters are the greatest downfall of this anime. The main leads, Kirito and Asuna, are some of the most unrealistic and boring characters. Kirito, with absolutely no
                  flaws, a ladiesman despite being a shut-in, changes his personality ridiculously. He acts completely different when facing different characters just to fit the required story at that point and changes from a cool loner to a bloody family man. Makes no sense. And with the ever perfect Asuna, no flaws or defining traits of any kind, make up some of the most uninteresting duo in anime history. Even the side characters are weak for side characters. The only character i would remotely stand was Suguha, at least see had an inch of depth.
Maybe i had too high expectations, but this anime was terrible for me. And it got worst and worst as it continued until it was absolutely unbearable
An anime which doesn't deserve the attention it gets, i do not recommend this. Don't expect much, or in fact, expect anything at all.",4
"
                I first came across this anime as a recommendation from a friend and I have to say, while the initial idea of the story seemed interesting, I was somewhat hesitant to begin the series due to the addiction factor that came with an uncompleted series. Having completed the 11 episodes in just about a day, I can truthfully say I was completely hooked and craved for more. 
Ill admit, the pacing of the story initially shocked me. The sense of time passing through this story seems rapid and jumps without warning at the beginning of each episode. However this can be forgiven as the first
                  few episodes of every anime is set mainly to develop a stable environment in order for the main story to begin. Although half of the episodes so far are used to develop a ""harem"", none of the characters stick to him like glue and each of their relationships reflect a key problem in this virtual world. 
Because of the rushed story, the character development is equally afflicted. The build up of power and sense of progression that we see in mainstream anime titles such as Naruto and One Piece are skipped, leaving a sense of disappointment. This is partly due to the original author of the light novel series in which this anime is adapted from which skips to stage 74/100 of the game. To be honest, from a more personal view I am quite content at this kind of structure, with the side stories creating the setting, followed up by diving into the romantic aspect of the anime. The characters themselves are likable and they creators try to avoid the obvious stereotypes by adding slight complexities to their characters.
The animation and musical choice were appropriate to say the least. They did not stand out too much but the artwork style fitted in with the context of the story although some of the animations could have been a lot smoother. The music however was executed perfectly. I could have sworn I had heard a few melodies from the long lost games in the past because they just seemed so generic. This of course is a positive factor and helps make the world of Aincrad more realistic as a game. 
The beauty of this story is not drawn from the characters, story, art or sound but it is the clear presentation of a fantastic virtual world. The onset of nostalgia which many will experience is an alluring factor, but the introduction to this new world and it's system is so clearly explained, one does not have to have experienced previous MMORPG to fully enjoy this series. SAO plays on our dreams and fantasies while at the same time question the obsessive nature of games and whether our actions in games reflect upon real world situations as well. Truly a unique mix of sci-fi and fantasy with an overwhelming romantic theme. 
*Just because I am not experienced with reviews nor have I watched too many anime titles I am not afraid to give this anime a 9 which I believe it deserves",9

                Sword Art Online. I don't think it's an exaggeration to rank this as one of the most hyped anime series of 2012. That being said, one only has to take a cursory glance at any SAO related forums, discussions et cetera to see for oneself - that SAO is undoubtedly a series dogged by controversy.
Fans of SAO are so devoted to it that they will leap into every discussion to defend any perceived slight at their beloved anime. On the other hand, people who detest it tend to make an almighty fuss about everything that has to do with it.
To be frank, I was actually
                  pretty fired up by the hype surrounding SAO and was anticipating an anime that was brilliantly presented, on par with the likes of Steins;Gate and Fate/Zero.
The first episode indeed lived up to all my expectations. We have a bunch of players trapped in a massive virtual world and a raving mad scientist ruling over said world. Throw in an additional quirk, dying in-game means a horribly real death in the real world. I could wax lyrical about the limitless opportunities this premise offered up! The second episode followed this up with a well delivered boss fight and excellent story development. Hope burned bright in the souls of many SAO fans.
However, all good things come to an end, and for SAO, it was disappointingly a whole 22 episodes earlier than expected.
Cue the main protagonist, Kirito suddenly transforming from a well thought out character into a cliched knight in shining armour. A Gary Stu to boot, perfect in every respect.
The few episodes go something like this.
A girl has a worry. Kirito pokes his nose in it. He miraculously manages to come up with a perfectly viable plan to solve the girl's problems and manages to execute it flawlessly every single time. The girl then suddenly develops romantic feelings towards her knight in shining armour a.k.a the one and only Kirito-kun. He's practically a stereotypical Gary Stu!
If it were a single episode interspersed in between the main story arcs I don't think anyone would have complained. But no! The studio in all its great wisdom decided to string 'em together in one almost unbearably long series of episodes.
The main grouse I have with this portion of the anime is that is does not have any bearing on the overall plot of the anime. See those cute girls that have befriended Kirito? They get one episode together in the limelight with him, and then fade away into the darkness. Helping someone get an item? Tell me how that's going to impact on the future plotline of the anime.
Whew. Now that I've got that out of my system, let's move on to rating the anime. 
I gave the story a 5. Essentially, SAO is a jumbled up mix of episodes that each do the main concept of the anime no favours at all. First we have the filler episodes. Then we have huge leaps in time. Heck, the first seven episodes spanned one and a half years, yet the rest of it up to the end of the SAO arc only took a few months. Ever heard of pacing, people? That pissed me off no end. I was expecting them to pace the SAO arc over the whole 25 episodes.
The one major problem in this area is that the people in charge either took excessive artistic licence or were high on something, because SAO is as filled with holes as a block of Swiss cheese in terms of plotholes. Basically we have logic defying actions, even within the rules of the SAO world. On one occasion, the anime even blatantly contradicts itself, feeding us the ridiculous idea that pure willpower and love can counter the rules of said world. Come on, give us a break. That's just a blatant deus ex machina!
Then we have ALO, or Alfheim Online.
 I won't spoil any people yet to watch SAO any further. Suffice to say that SAO's story and execution as a whole are mediocre, extending to the ALO arc. Its only saving grace is that the plot twists are quite well executed and unexpected when they are not logic defying.
Art-wise I have no particular complaints to make. The art as a whole is solid stuff, especially in a few scenes that are a feast for the eyes. A 7 overall.
Moving on to the sound. 
The first OP, LiSA's crossing field was decent. Not bad, but not too good either, a hallmark of her songs. First ED, forgettable, generic and very plain indeed. I feel that the second OP was a shade better than crossing field. And finally, the pièce de résistance, the 2nd ED, Overfly. In my opinion it was actually a great song. Haruna Luna's not half bad. The soundtracks were done by Kajiura Yuki. Need I say more? 8 out of 10.
Characters! Now we're getting serious. I mean DEAD serious.
A breakdown :
Kirito - Every part of him shouts Gary Stu! He is the modern day Sherlock Holmes with wonderful deduction ability. He is a chick magnet without even trying to. He always goes out of his way to help people. He even gets a wife after non-existent courtship! He's even got his own unique Dual Wield sword skill because he's just that badass! ""Make me a sammich and a rabbit stew, Asuna!"" ""Okay!""
Asuna - The female protagonist. When we first see her, she appears as a strong character, with the personality and traits to match as well. Granted, she does play some important roles in the earlier stages of the SAO arc. After that, she degenerates into Kirito's sidekick. What, you're among the top in your guild hierarchy and a front liner to boot, yet Kirito has to fight for your freedom from your guild? For some honeymoon so that you can spend your lovey-doey couple time together? She gets even worse in the ALO arc. Basically, Asuna is there to help Kirito on the road to awesomeness. Whenever she's in a spot of trouble, cue Kirito stepping in and coolly getting rid of her problems, be it enemies, monsters or otherwise. No point in her existing otherwise, is there?
These two are the only two that SAO really focuses on. The supporting cast are merely there to cheer them on. They play no major role and do not impact the storyline. Some even appear in only one episode!
Characters - A really bad one. 3 from 10. It would have been lower if Yui didn't at least appear to compliment the Kirito-Asuna pairing. 
Enjoyment - I'm going to give it a deserving 7. I will concede that although the story and characters are immensely lacking, I quite enjoyed the series. Between facepalming at those god awful plotholes to being absorbed in the beautiful world of SAO, it's actually quite an enjoyable experience.
In conclusion, SAO is probably an anime series that polarises opinion like never before. I'm going to take a neutral stand here and say that I neither detest nor love it. Else there's probably gonna be another SAO flame war.
The source material by the author is excellent, but suffers very badly when being adapted by those ""What the fuck are they smoking, they're so high"" people from A-1 Pictures. 
I'm giving it a 6. Seeing as the light novel is selling as fast as Kirito attracts chicks, I'll go out on a limb here and say I'm very hopeful of a further season 2.
Now, if only they would kick A-1 out and replace them with a better studio...",6
"
                ""It's shit right?""
""It's shit.""
Shit Art Online, is essentially, shit. I don't even need to delve deep into this. It's laced with god awful writing, and panders to every autistic teenager on the planet. It's like a kid's fantasy, put onto paper and given a budget. Any teenager with angst could write this plot, and write it better than the hack of a writer that got it published. 
Our protagonist, Gary Stu, is the best ever. He gets the best drops and weapons. He's one of the only players to get a unique skill. He gets the boss kills. He gets the most beautiful girl in
                  the game, who also, coincidentally, is one of the best players. He also gets his own harem of good looking females, in a game which is supposed to make up of a small female population. He beats the game (Hurr Durr what a surprise) and saves everyone. My hero!
But why? Was it through character development? The power of friendship? Luck? No, no, and no. It's just because he does. Because he's the main character. Because the author loves his fantasy, where he is the alpha male, and where every desire can be fulfilled.
It's called self-insert. It's what you are doing. Stop it. It ruins the fun for everyone else.
Now, there is nothing wrong with having a fantasy. But when you go and rate a show a 10, which has more plot holes than a hooker has STD’s, we have a serious problem. 
Despite the whole ""death game"" concept, there is no danger whatsoever thanks to Mr. Emoangstsoloplayer. Anyone who dies does it off screen, or we are told about it. Or, we meet them for as long as it takes to remember their vague design, and then they get killed off. What was her name again? Huh funny, I can’t remember since she was on screen for 10 minutes. So it's almost like they didn't die at all. Now that kept me on the edge of my seat. And then the one time someone should die, he doesn’t! Holy shit how’d that happen?!? Fucking magic, man I tell ya.
And there’s plenty of times where someone should die, but through some magical ass pull, save themselves and accomplish what they set out to do anyway. What’s the point in suspense if we already know the outcome? Jumping on a dragon to escape a giant pit? Why even have scientific laws that prevent people from doing the impossible when they can pull shit like this? This isn’t a super robot show, where the explicitly tell you to kick logic to the curb. Pathetically, the show tries to force a sense of realism down my throat I can’t swallow.
There's also a lack of depth to every character. The villain makes the game because HE CAN, Asuna stands there and looks pretty, the more interesting side characters (Klein, Gilbert and I had to look those names up, I wanted to say red hair and black guy) get swept aside by Mr. Gay personified and become wallpaper. The protagonist couldn’t be any more of a teenage faggot. I've had enough with these cardboard thin backgrounds and personalities; kill them off and be done with it. I'm in a kiddie pool and drowning here, even though it's shallow like this stories writing.
The Op by LiSa is by far the best thing about this show besides the quality budget. It's a good thing Asuna's ass won't look ugly, because there is nothing else to look at here folks. Seriously, I found at least 10 moments where a females ass took up half the screen in plain sight. Have the decency to at least put it in the background. We all know who your marketing is targeted towards.
Don’t even mention the horrid pacing. The show attempts to cram big chunks of story into singular episodes and falls flat on its face. How am I supposed to come to relate to a character if I only know them for a short period of time? Yet somehow these girls come to fall in love with the main character, within 10-15 minutes of meeting the! It’s asinine how a logical human being can call that development. I shall point it out again; it’s all for the sake of the fantasy. A romance show you say? Excuse me while I fall into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.
Shit Art Online’s writing is equivalent to that of an Inuyasha fan fiction written by an overweight fujoshi. The writer was a very young man when he wrote the first novel, as apparent by his lack of talent or any of resemblance of skill. “Two years’ worth of semen made a glopping noise as it flowed endlessly into Asuna.” Now I realize this line is novel only, but it does mean something when it comes to the show. Do you really think a man, who could seriously and EARNESTLY write a line like that, could write a good story? Doesn’t that line just make you want to crack up? And can anyone tell me what a glopping noise sounds like?
Must sound like shit.",2

                Sword Art Online has become a phenomenon in the anime community. Since it has premiered it has gained both a large amount of fame and infamy. Nowadays it's really known for the latter, and seen as intensely mediocre by a lot of people. My thoughts on the matter probably won't be as articulate as some other people's, but I'll try my best to explain why I think SAO is a terrible anime.
When I first heard of SAO's premise, I was already put off. While I understand that it has potential, it just sounded very fanfic-y to me and not really that appealing, which is why
                  it didn't really become one of those shows where I was like ""MUST WATCH"". Sometime later the infamy just caught up to me and I decided it wouldn't hurt to have a look-see.
The premise of SAO is essentially that some douchebag named Akihiko Kayaba trapped a bunch of people in the eponymous Sword Art Online for...reasons. The story follows Kirito, a lone gamer, as he strives to make it through to the end of the game safely, as losing in the game equals death in real life as well. On the way he also falls in love with a girl named Asuna.
Before getting into the main problems of the story, let me begin by addressing the ""strong"" points of the show as it were.
The show IS occasionally pretty in terms of visuals, however to say that it is artistically good is giving it a little bit too much credit. The character designs are honestly nothing special; they aren't vomit-inducing by any means, but they are pretty generic anime designs. They have a certain appeal but are nothing special. The armor and monster designs are also pretty uninspired and look like they were created by amateurs. It reminds me of the Tales series, whose art direction I also am not a fan of. This is no Final Fantasy XIV that's for sure.
The music is by Yuki Kajiura, who also worked on Madoka Magica (which is a MUCH better show than this piece of shit). It's a decent score, granted, but it's nothing too outstanding and doesn't in any way make up for the huge pitfalls that are the story and characters.
The story is very, very poorly paced, has terrible focus, and jumps the shark so quickly it's scary. The first episode is promising enough (though again, calling it excellent is a stretch); it sets up the stakes, gives a nice amount of tension, introduces the protagonist and main villain, and leaves you hopeful. Kirito is hardly an interesting character at first glance, but that's forgivable because it's only the first episode. The second episode introduces the supposed main female character, Asuna, and fleshes out the setting a bit more. It's nothing fantastic but the plot progresses a little and stuff actually does happen.
What follows afterwards however are like 5 episodes of irrelevant BS interspersed with incredibly poorly written, adolescent drama that feels like it belongs in fanfiction.  The majority of the episodes are just propping up Kirito by having him win the affections of various girls in different ways, while also occasionally giving him a cheap source of angst for him to fuss over. The setting does get fleshed out more, but the thing is that this ultimately ends up being completely irrelevant to what BECOMES the main plot.
And what is the main plot? Kirito and Asuna's romance. And let me tell you, it sucks. It's incredibly forced, dull, and rushed. The majority of the development of their relationship happens off-screen, it does not feel natural or realistic in the slightest. What it feels like is that it was written as an otaku's fantasy version of what a relationship would actually resemble, because they lack the knowledge of how such a thing actually works, and how to convincingly portray it through writing.
It really astounds me as to how much of a cancerous tumor the entire thing turned out to be; they SERIOUSLY go into the woods to have a vacation and raise a kid while their fucking lives are on the line. I thought they were supposed to be trying to fight for their lives and go home? I understand Kirito is all about escapism and how this world feels real to him bla bla bla but this isn't executed in a mature and sophisticated way so it just feels like a stupid waste of time. 
Kirito ends up defeating Kayaba through Deus Ex Machina (the power of love overpowers even videogame rules, how about that), and then we go into another bullshit arc that introduces a lot of other nonsense like Kirito's boring one-dimensional adopted sister who's in love with him (gee i haven't seen this incestuous imouto stuff in like every other bad anime ever) and an even more awful villain than the first arc. 
In summation, the plot of SAO COMPLETELY failed to deliver on its potential. Instead of exploring philosophical, moral, and ethical questions about the setting and situation and doing good legitimate worldbuilding (which it at least seemed to be trying to do earlier on, albeit poorly), it threw all of that away to focus on a terrible love story. What the hell was even the point of writing this in the first place? The entire tension that was supposed to be felt was just not there, and with the second arc it just evaporates completely. It is the EXACT opposite of a compelling narrative, it's childish and amateurish writing at its most apparent.
With that out of the way, the characters in SAO are all bad. Kirito is little more than a blank slate for anime and videogame otaku to project themselves onto; he has a super edgy black coat and sword, he has a SUPER SPESHUL DUBBL SWORDS power exclusive to him (so much for SAO being fair), all the girls want him, everyone wants to be him, he has a super kawaii waifu who cooks for him, gets to play parent with a not-really child, saves the day even though everything says he shouldn't be able to, etc. He's as dull as dishwater. Calling him the ""Black Swordsman"" is an insult to Guts, the actual Black Swordsman.
The rest of the characters are all similarly paper thin and boring. Asuna starts out as an affirmative, tough female protagonist (though not an interesting one by any means), but gradually gets demoted to useless domestic waifu while her hubby Kirito does the actual heavy lifting. The misogynistic undertones present are honestly pretty gross.
The side characters are mostly irrelevant and pointless. The girls of the week are just flimsy archetypes and little more than that, they serve no purpose in the grander narrative at all. Lisbeth is easily the best one, and one I actually did kind of like, but I'm not going to pretend she was anything special either. While I say all of this, I do agree that Klein is pretty bro from what we see of him and that if he was the main character instead SAO probably would have been a much more tolerable series, because Klein at least seemed to have some semblance of a personality.
The villains are terrible and have no actual reasons for what they are doing besides the fact that they are bad people. Worse than that, they are not charismatic or interesting in spite of that, like Johann Liebert from Monster, Griffith from Berserk, Hannibal Lecter, etc. They just suck.
The main thing that keeps rearing its ugly head over and over again in all the things that are wrong with SAO is just how incredibly masturbatory it is. It seems strictly designed to fellate the main character (a stand-in for game and anime otaku), pandering to its demographic as much as possible, instead of focusing on delivering a focused narrative with compelling writing. Literally every single attempt this show makes at drama or generally invoking pathos falls completely flat because Kawahara obviously doesn't understand humans or the basics of writing enough to get emotional reactions that aren't mirthful laughter, disgust, annoyance, apathy or boredom.
I get that this is a shounen story and I shouldn't expect that much from it to begin with, but that doesn't mean it has to be terrible.
As elitist as it sounds to say this, the only reason I can see anyone propping this up as anything more than serviceable/mediocre is that they just haven't watched enough anime or read enough manga or just experienced enough stories in general to know there's SO MUCH BETTER STUFF OUT THERE. Seriously, even if you just wanted harem or moe stuff, there are better shows than this out there.",3
"
                Sword art online is not one about action, but instead is a pseudo harem monomyth despite what the first episode suggests. It implores the same marketing tactic as Accel World, and Guilty Crown, where the 1st episode is merely a showstopper/crowd-pleaser with alot of eye candy and flashing lights as well as a misleading title, in order to accrue a sizeable fanbase. But if we ignore the 1st episode, and look at the anime as a whole it can be said that the anime was adequate for its intended purpose.
//Story
The story is quite simple, and it seemed to copy the core ideas of hack//sign, but
                  to a lesser extent, that is it focuses more on romance rather than action after the 1st episode. The story seems to advance rather too quickly after the 1st episode, where it seems to bounce from the 1st floor, to the 50th floor in a mere episode. As an aside just to explain the floors, the anime featured a large tower which the hero must climb, similar to that of Druga, that featured floor 1 to 100 that had a very powerful boss awaiting on the top floor. So it was quite clear that the 2nd episode sparked large displeasure/controversy in the audience. So just to reiterate an important point, the plot moves very fast, it was expected there to be minor 'time' leaps and that the entire anime would revolve around climbing the tower that was featured in the anime to be the ultimate obstacle to freedom. But that was not the case. Sword art Online's story ended mid-season, in a rather, pathetic fashion. For a damsel-in-distress or monomyth anime, in regards to the 2nd portion of the anime, it did amazingly so in it's portrayal, but as an action-game anime, it failed miserably. The plot moved too fast, the romance seemed to be forced, for example where suddenly two protagonists get together in a romantic relationship almost seemingly out of nowhere (though there were small hints), and the fact that the circumstances which brought this about in the anime was unrealistic. The manga on sword art online could explain clearly why people in the virtual game could live as well as other questions on the context of the world of Sword Art, but the anime failed to explain adequately such small questions, resulting in an un-cohesive/disjointed anime with too many questions to be asked about the world. So if a person watched only the anime, without reference to any of the  written works of Sword Art Online, the anime seemed to be fundamentally confusing. Sci-fi worlds must have depth, Sword Art Online lacked depth due it's seemingly short time frame.
//Art and Sound
The art and sound is something you'd expect to be top notch in an eyecandy anime like this, the first opening song, ""Crossing fields"" by LiSA seemed to resonate with the anime very well. Other notable mentions are, Innocence by Aoi Eir (2nd opening), Yume Sekai by Haruka Tomatsu (1st ED), and Overfly by Luna Haruna (2nd ED). The music in the anime was pretty well done, and seemed to blend well with the situations depicted in the anime. 
//Character
The MC seems to be the most random personality on the anime, he's indecisive at times, a genius at times in decision making, and may other inconsistencies with his character. In the monomyth structure, where the hero saves the 'damsel in distress' the hero seems to become stronger, more intelligent or at least improve in character as the story progresses, with Kirito( MC), the reverse seems to happen. So as character progression goes, there seems to be regression rather progression in the case of the MC. The other characters, seemingly very vague, despite the anime being a fantasy. Other animes such as Hunter x Hunter, go out of they way to explain the background of side characters that are going to die in the next episode. Though I don't expect Sword Art Online to have this kind of depth in it's 25 episode anime( which could've been split into seperate seasons to make it seem less rushed, especially at the end), it could've at least explained more about the important female characters that turned the emotionally stagnant Kirito into a Cloud Strife. 
//Enjoyment
I can't say I didn't enjoy the anime, but the appalling story development and heavily flawed characters make it difficult to progress with the anime. The story seems to jump at random speeds; from very fast, to slow, to fast, to very fast (at the end). The ending of the anime reminds me of Avatar Kora where the last episode seems to be 6 episodes smashed into one episode. So for enjoyment I'd say I'd be a 6 or a 7. 
//Verdict
Overall, due to the reason stated above, I'd say the anime is around a 5 (mediocre), the anime was heavily over hyped due to its flashly first episode, but from then on, it seriously let down fans on the episodes afterwards. The anime seemed to combine 2 seasons into 1 seasons for some bizarre reason which just caused disjointedness, and a very strange final episode.
But if you've read this far, I'd like to thank you for reading my review.",5
"
                I apologize for my ignorance in advance, as I have not read the manga or the light novels or any other related media corresponding to this franchise. This review is solely preliminary and focuses on the first 5 episodes only. 
Sword Art Online seems to be an anime hyped up by many this season. Its easy to see why, as the setting of a virtual world in which players are trapped and must fight for their lives can easily attract many. Personally, I was excited as well, and as the summer anime season rolled by, I immediately picked it up. I had very high hopes
                  for this anime, as it was in fact my first ""virtual reality"" anime. I had never watched .hack or any other similar anime so the setting was very fresh to me and i wanted to see how an anime taking place inside an MMO would play out. Now that I've viewed episode 5, it seems fitting to offer my initial thoughts on the series. In my opinion, Sword art online definitely did not disappoint in its portrayal of a virtual world, but is seriously lacking in other aspects such as character development and story. 
Lets start with the good. Wow. What a fantastic world SAO is. Its portrayal definitely made me jealous of the players. Except for the fact that they were unable to log out and that dying meant death, I definitely wanted to visit SAO. Sword art online portrays its world magnificently. The art is fantastic, the settings are vibrant and colorful, and they all make the viewer feel that they are, in fact, in a virtual MMO. However, what I was even more impressed with were the concepts introduced in SAO. Its easy to see that SAO was inspired by many of today's MMORPGs  but SAO takes it a step further and translates all of these concepts into a VMMORPG. Its very interesting to see how the concept of guilds, parties, and health points are portrayed in a world where the player is the character. One thing i thought was brilliant and hilarious was the concept of ""sleep-pk,"" in which a player duels another player who is asleep, by using the asleep player's finger to accept the request. Overall, sword art online has a magnificent setting and I am looking forward to it expanding over the course of the series.
Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of the storyline or the characters. One main issue I had with the storyline probably came from my unfamiliarity with the franchise. The time gap between episodes 1-5 is erratic and almost none of the episodes had any contiunuty. Generally I'm open to this type of storytelling but the jumping around simply left me confused. Kirito's experience changes drastically in between episodes and it almost seems like he is a different person in each new episode. After wathcing episode 5 it seems that they are finally going through with an ""arc,"" though I would have very much liked for them to continue a coherent story from episode 1. I feel the episodes were more used to show off the concepts and setting of SAO rather than to give insight into Kirito's personality and motives. In fact, I feel that this format of storytelling actually hindered my relationship with Kirito and isolated me from his character. Because of this its hard to keep track of Kirito as so much time passes by in between each episode. In addition, I feel that Kirito is too one dimensional as a character. In almost every episode, he plays the role of a ""white knight"" and helps random girls he runs into. It seems to me that he has no agenda in each episode, and that he is simply there, playing the game and helping people that he runs into. Its hard to see any ulterior motives and it seems to me that Kirito is 100% pure, which I hate because it subtracts from the depth the writers could have added to his character. In episode 5, Asuna returns(finally) and the two embark on an epic journey to.. help investigate a random murder. It seems to me at this point that most of the shows conflicts are caused more by other players rather than by the world itself. I would very much like to see Kirito ""progress"" in the game world and have a goal that he can work towards, rather than come to the aid of anybody who needs his help. Everyone he interacts with seems to be a girl as well(I was starting to think this anime was turning into a harem.)
To sum it up Sword Art Online is definitely worth watching. The weaknesses I addressed only pertain to the first 5 episodes and it is very possible that the show will pick up. I'm very much expecting it to. The setting is magnificent, and has revived my daydreams of visiting a virtual world. I hope to see a lot more good things from this anime and will post another review whenever I feel like it.",6
"
                This anime is like wish-fulfillment drug for male teenagers and adults who're addicted to online gaming and can't deal with real-life challenges. 
It basically shows them what they want to see - a perfect male hero who is loved by all the girls (including his effing cousin), who can solve any problem, and despite only playing games since he was 10 -  is still fairly handsome and thin (yeah, that's how it works!).
All the girls are cute, forgiving, compassionate and inferior in terms of skill and wits to the main male character. Even the main female lead, who stars of quite good and strong
                  is sort of degraded through the series to this pretty princess-wife type of character who is only there to be either saved by a hero or abused by the villain.
The online world, despite of being an effing death-trap is still portrayed as a better place than reality. Because hey, at least there is no homework, work, parents or that other pesky things that just get in the way!
I'm not giving this a 1 or 2 because honestly it stared of pretty good, the art was nice and pleasant and  there were moments were I enjoyed it later on, but hell did it leave me disturbed and upset at the end. In terms of plot the second half was simply dreadful... (and some questions from the first part were also left unanswered.)
On some levels, especially the ones considering representation of women, this anime is disgusting. What's even more frustrating it's not that straight-forward about it but it hides this under the game reality rules and some illusion of a strong female character.",3
"
                I can't add to what others have said but let me just briefly summarize my opinion, criticism, and praise.
= [ ( Story ) ] =   ****3****
I apologize for such low rating.  What started out as a promising series, SAO lets down its audience with weak plot and conflict resolutions.  The periodic and time lapses between episodes cause confusion and misunderstanding.  Without your ability to access primary source (LN), some of the plots are unclear, if not simply misplaced.  What remains of the plot?  Instead of focusing on serious aspects of the story, we are dished with series of
                  MC's love interest, which serves zero purpose to actual  love interest of MC.  Harem is a word that fits this situation.  The excessive amount of fan service that this story vomits is unjustified and unnecessary.  However, SAO delivers simple and understandable plot objectives, which a little child could understand.  There is a clarity in its objective and I applaud the author of SAO for making that very clear.  
= [ ( Art ) ] = +++ 6 +++
the art is very justified for this sort of anime.  With harem, loli, and incest, the cutesy style of art is very fitting and well applied.  At the same time however, it does draw away from the believability of the story as a serious material, which the plot, at least at the beginning, promised to be a very mature topic.  It is fortunate that SAO art tries to please teenagers and casual watchers and opted out for harem/romance/damsel in distress plot devices.  
= [ ( Sound ) ] = """""""" 8 """"""""
Excellent music--one of saving grace of the series.  It adds excitement to otherwise boring and repetitive action scenes, which seems to overuse charging and 360 degree back and forth.
= [ ( Character ) ] = """"""""3""""""""
Character development is shallow.  MC is given little time for character development.  Little of what does occur uses convenient plot devices [i.e. death of a friend] to advance its objective, which is extremely cliche and unoriginal.  The time given to achieve this objective was narrowed to just one episode, which devastated the impact of the development as a whole.  As well, other character developments are small or absolutely zero.  If there was a little development, it was completely dependent on their interaction with the MC and it is highly unclear whether character development is visible or understandable from the viewers perspective. 
= [ ( Enjoyment ) ] = """"""""""6""""""""""
SAO is fairly entertaining, due to its cliche plot and high production value.  The forced incest drama is really the highlight of this show, so I highly recommend it.
= [ ( Overall ) ] = """"""""5""""""""
I would like to think that 5 is justifiable by my reasoning.  I would've given it 7 or 8 if it weren't for the horrible pacing, weak character development, and overall hype that is given to this show.  IF the show was focused instead of trying to be everything (harem, romance, incest, tragedy, drama, action, seinen, tentacle, sex), SAO could've been an awesome project.",5
"
                Sword Art Online is a terrible, childish, fanfiction level show that has been hyped to death and given mass high scores that it simply does not deserve. But there's probably a good reason for that and that is it's setting. It seems if you want to earn big cash while putting out a dreadful show, choosing to go with a MMO-gaming style theme is the way to go.
The allure of the show lies in the setting of a virtual reality world where one practically becomes the video game hero you have always dreamed of as a child. It probably isn't an over-generalization to say anyone
                  who has played a number of video games as a child or has played one MMO dreams of becoming a character in such a reality. The presentation of this ego feeding world is done well enough, with the typical dungeons, towns, and fields that gamers reminisce about to how mechanics and physics work in the world. But this isn't enough to cover up the underlying pack of cliches and poor writing the show is full of.
The biggest problem with the plot is that it is expanded in to month skips. The show presents an interesting concept where the players of Sword Art Online must beat the game and if their health bar reaches zero, they are killed just like how it would be in real life. Yet, instead of presenting how the 10,000 characters adapt to this horrific news at the beginning of this nightmare, the game proceeds with the main character running off a field with a childish ""I want to be the very best!"" and goes on with a one month skip and a 2000 death number. And with almost each episode, another series of month skips are given without going in to full details about the main character's journey. The month skips are redundant, pass up what would be great opportunities to see the world of SAO, the struggles of characters, and just plain makes the pacing of the show out of rhythm. Flashbacks and lack of details will leave the viewer pondering many questions which can only be answered by doing your own homework: something that a show simply should not force upon viewers.
If there is one thing this show cannot be forgiven for is the characters themselves, especially Kirito. Many of the characters in the show are one-dimensional, have no real depth, and are simply awfully written. From Klein (The typical bro) to Silica (Moeblob) to Asuna (Aloof tsundere), the characters have nothing interesting to present to the viewer besides their one-defining archetype. 
But the biggest offender to one-dimensional is Kiritio, a character solely created as a self-insert for a kid. From his inability to succeed in real life to becoming the envy of everyone in Sword Art Online, to episodes solely created so girls can fall for how nice he is, to his lack of struggles in the world, he is the epitome of the Gary Stu character. Typically you would expect for a main character to struggle through quests, monsters, bosses, other foul players, etc when given a show about a MMO virtual reality world. Instead Kirito proceeds to breeze through and humiliate any obstacle given. You aren't watching a character become stronger and develop, Kirito starts right off as an unbeatable character who smashes straight through everything. His only real conflict is his belief that he cannot protect his friends and comrades, a laughable messiah complex and the biggest cliche of ""heroes."" Kirito's character concept is nothing but childish. 
With it's horrendous plot progression and even more horrendous characters, Sword Art Online can only be called mediocre at best. It presents an interesting world but suffers from a lack of exploration and finer details. The production values and soundtrack are nothing impressive and in the end one is simply left with a show that had great ideas, but was poorly executed.",4
"
                Hype Art Online, or HAO like everyone calls it, is one of the 2 Summer season shows which are worth of a try. Positively thinking it's, luckily, the only Summer series which disappointed me with its mediocrity, over-used cliches and worth-of-nothing characters. 
Before continuing, I need to make something clear about this thing you might be thinking about me; ""You are just mad because HAO got such a high mean score after its first episode."" This, my friend, is some hilarious shit. Mainly because I replaced an S with an H. Other than that, the sentence is pretty much bullshit. ""People are trying to get
                  it a mean score high as possible because mean score makes the anime better."" Sounds about as legit. To say make it simple; I don't care about mean scores, I only care about the quality of anime.
After watching the first minute of the series you will already know what the author has in mind - To trap the players inside the game world. When this happends one would expect the players to panic due not getting back to their own world, isn't that right? But nope, that doesn't happen because HAO is one-dimentional shonen which doesn't try to be smart nor realistic by any means at all. I'm wrong? Imagine how you would act in the same situation.
To make the setting even more cliche and lame you need to make your characters the same. So obviously our MC is the best player in that game and everyone envies him and his skills, he is the best, that's it. This is pretty much the thing what everyone dreamed when they were 7 years-old. You know what shit usually happens when this is done? Lack of character development. The MC also got some other nice tropes to his heart, like badass, which doesn't suite him at all, nor any other bishonen due it appearing mainly overly gay. 
But wait! Some shit happens and there is a player.. even more.. powerful than our MC??!?! Like how? Isn't that the most cliche thing fucking ever? Oh, yeah, almost forgot the nature of this series. Needs to put over-used cliche to lame cliche to make the series deep, all the depth and shit. 
Cliches aren't all that bad thing if the story is otherwise awesome, the writer has balls to do shit and the character are actually worth of caring about. Unfortunately there is nothing to hold on to in Sword Bishonen Online, which makes it easily to be forgotten, and thus it's not memorable. Substance much? Pretty much the only different between Accel World and SBO is that HAO is dead-boring already from the very beginning while AW had actually some potentiality in the beginning. Also, pretty sure HBO will broadcast this at some point.
The pace of the series is something I'd call weird. Seems like not much is happening, yet the whole thing is extremely rushed. When I say it's rushed, I do not mean that the pacing is super fast. From recent anime e.g. Sakamichi no Apollon is really fast paced but it's not rushed due talented direction and quality execution. That's something HAO just lacks. Also, the director is a noname who has e.g. been part of the team who wrote Guilty Crown's storyboard, so, there you go. Just saying, though. 
Production values really aren't notable. The art isn't bad but nothing special either, but I do agree it being fitting to the series. I personally dislike the character desing for the reason that it reminds me of personality lacking fanservice robots from Guilty Crown, but maybe that's just me. Animation is okay, but nothing worth of praising. It's not like the producers are known from their action scenes or anything anyway. Voice acting is decent enough. Theme songs come from LiSA, and she is amazing. Best thing in the series if you ask me, but I'm music faggot anyway. 
I already heard complains about how wrong I am because HAO is actually one of the best from this Summer season. But no, don't misunderstand me. This season is absolutely terrible. I'm not saying this show is utter trash when comparing to other this season shows, I'm saying HAO is another cliche and very much an average series. It might be really enjoyable to watch, but is it actually good and easy to find it entertaining? No, I don't think so.",3
"
                WARNING: Spoilers ahead; read at your own risk. (Or if you don't really care, then read away, I guess...)
Well, where shall I begin with this... I'll just say right now that this series (one which I had really high hopes for) ended up becoming absolutely horrid by the second half; each episode getting progressively worse than the last. But, in any case, let's discuss this shall we?
The story: It's basically just your typical MMO-genre type of series (think .Hack but with actual fighting as opposed to the characters just standing around and talking episode after episode). The first half of the series takes place in
                  the world of Sword Art Online (hence the title) where everyone including the main character, Kirito, becomes trapped and in order to free themselves from their virtual imprisonment, they must clear all of the floors within the world's dungeon.(There's the whole ""if you die in this world you'll die in real life"" thing, but again, this is really nothing new.) In the second half, Kirito enters another MMO called ALfheim Online where he must now rescue his waifu, Asuna (a girl he met in the first game that ended up being trapped in the virtual world after everyone else in SAO had been freed) who now lies waiting for him at the top of the World Tree, a colossal tree in the centre of this new world. I won't go into too much detail, but the series really goes downhill from this point on. I'll just say that there were a few bad writing choices and leave it at that. *Cough.* A horrible villain, a tentacle scene, and incest (Oh my!). *Cough.*
The Art: Definitely one of the high points of this series (this being one of the only ones). As an artist myself, I can say the characters were drawn fairly well, but I can't help but say that I've seen this art style somewhere before... Oh well, moving on! Though aside from the characters, I must say that the world(s) look absolutely gorgeous and there seems to be quite a few well used colour schemes in certain scenes. Bottom line: It's pretty and colourful. NEXT!
The Sound: The soundtrack was both very intense as well as very peaceful and relaxing when it needed to be during certain scenes. Although, if I had to make one nitpick about it then I'd say that a lot of the tracks sound fairly similar to one another if not almost the same track played differently. (Though I can't say that for certain, it did sound like that to me.)
The Characters: This part was kind of like a roller coaster to me; at one point I'd want to murder them for all of the horrible choices they made, but then they kind of grew on me as the series progressed. However, during the second part when a certain character appeared, I just couldn't take this series seriously (especially near the end where he was literally licking off the heroine's tears and trying to rape her whilst the protagonist could only sit and watch). Just... No... A tip for any writers out there: DON'T MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS ACT LIKE BLOODY CARTOONS! If you want to write a character well, then make them a bit more realistic and even relatable. Even a villain can be a relatable character if written correctly (trust me, I've seen it).
Overall, it wasn't a completely AMAZING series like I was hoping for, but I did get a fair amount of enjoyment from it (not so much the second half, but beggars can't be choosers). If you want to watch it for the sake of wanting to watch something of this genre, then just watch up to episode fourteen and drop it immediately (trust me, the other half is not worth sticking around for). If you're a writer looking for what NOT to do, then I'd recommend watching it all the way through. What are you doing still reading this? Go watch it and see for yourself whether it's good or not. Go on... Shoo...",6
"
                Okay, so this is my first review. Here it goes.
 So, when I first watched this I was like, ""Cool! This looks so great! The style is great, the plot can lead to many different directions and the OST is EPIC! I mean, people getting trapped in a video game and have to defeat 100 bosses? I look forward to lots of action!""
 FALSE.
 The first 3 episodes were good, but then it turned into some stupid romance with no character development, what-so-ever! So, now, I will rate the anime.
Story-1
 I would give it a 4 because of the whole, defeat the bosses to escpae
                  death thing, but that was really only like, 3 episodes in the entire thing, infact,
*SPOILER* they move onto a different vide ogame after. *SPOILEROVER* 
They could have had  such a great story coming from the whole ""main"" plot. Like each arc could have been 1 boss/floor. But the there were time skips, that just made the story even worse because Kirito, the main character, goes from some okay guy, to the most powerful guy out there! HOW? Then, as soon as he 
*SPOILER* asked asuna to marry him*SPOILEROPVER*
 I was like, I'm done with this! It tricked me, an action lover, into thinking it was an action anime, but then it turned into a stupid romance with a pathetic action scene here and there. There were also a lot of plot holes. and they were BIG plot holes. I don't want to give anything away,though.
Art 8
The art was actually really good, one of the things that drew me into the anime at first. The outfits, backrounds, colour, and such, all wonderful.
Sound 10
 I LOVE the music. Yuki Kajura does it again! The sound track is so beautiful, I still listen to it. The best part of this anime was the sound track:) EPICNESS! It's too bad the anime wasn't as great as the OST.
Character 2
The only good character was kirito, but even he wasn't 3 dimensional. He was perfect. Too perfect. Everyone else, I hated, especially asuna, she doesn't even deserve a capital at the beginning of her name. Kirito was WAY to good for her and all she was good for was cooking. Also, they didn't even focus on any other character besides Kirito and asuna. They didn't even focus on the bad guy. 
Enjoyment 3
 Did I enjoy this? The first 3 episodes? yes. The rest? NO! It was always Kirito going around making girls fall for him and then dumping them without really meaning to. It wasn't even significant to the plot. I didn't even finish the anime. It was too sad. It went all down hill at episode 3. All. Down. Hill.
Overall 2
 If I find the average, this anime would get a 5. (4.8, but I rounded it) I gave it a 2 because this anime almost made me cry. In a bad way. It was that dumb. It had SOOOOOO much potential, but the writers killed it. I also heard that the second half wasn't as good as good as the first and if the first half got a 2 from me, I wasn't wasting my bandwith.banwith. what ever it is called. I mean, the best part about the first arc was that if they died in the game the died in real life. That doesn't happen in the second arc. How do I know? I watched the last episode or something.
*SPOILER ALERT* which makes no sense since they both die at the end of the arc and somehow live. Does that mean they could have died and just left the game peacfully all along? plot hole! *SPOILEROVER*
Anywho, this was a pretty sad anime, and when i say sad, I mean SAD. Some people actually like it though, so if you like anime with failed plots, give it a try:)",2

                Sword Art Online – it’s the anime where you either hate it or love it. On paper, it seems like a very good idea: ten thousand people are trapped in a virtual world with no way out other than completing all one hundred floors of the world which get increasingly difficult. Gamers everywhere would love this concept and as a gamer, I won’t lie when I say that Sword Art Online intrigued me. The first episode was very promising – beautiful art with some of the most gorgeous scenery, a nice tutorial for not only a newcomer to the game, but the audience as well
                  and a main character that seemed very likable. The future looked bright for the series and I anticipated more.
And, in one fell swoop, the delight of the first episode vanished as it went on. And on.
That’s not to say that the entire series should be exactly like the first episode, it shouldn’t. The problem is that everything that made the first episode so great is absent from the rest of the series. The breathtaking environments and even the likability of the main character seem to crash and burn as soon as the second episode hits. People hating on the beta-testers, labelling them as “beaters” when they’re clearly the people you would want helping you the most. It’s very strange that as it goes on, you’re introduced to characters that you’ll be seeing more of but only if they haven’t appeared for six episodes. Those characters in particular are the most interesting ones.
The story follows Kirito, one of those aforementioned beta-testers that already knows the ropes and happenings of Sword Art Online. He starts off as a guide to another character in the very first episode, being very energetic and helpful towards him. The problem is, due to his real life shut-in tendencies, Kirito likes to be by himself, therefore being a solo player. When it’s discovered that no one can log out of the game, it’s revealed that the ten thousand people in the game can’t escape and their minds are trapped in the game. If they die in the game, they’re dead in real life. If someone takes off the headgear needed to play the game, it’ll fry their brain and kill the player. It is said that whoever can complete all one hundred floors of the game can escape and free everyone. With that, Kirito goes on his merry journey to save everyone, though his initial intent is to save himself.
The premise is good, but the execution is absolutely poor beyond belief. As the series goes on, the overall life-or-death theme goes out the window for the main character, since he becomes far stronger than anyone else in the game. As the series goes on, there are a lot of time-gaps. It can be several months before something important to the plot actually happens and there isn’t much of a care regarding who has died besides those who the main character knows. Early on in the series, Kirito meets a small guild who doesn’t know his true level or his strength. Within the guild, there’s a girl who believes she’s not very strong and takes a liking to Kirito after they have a talk. Within the same episode, she dies. This gives the illusion that you’re supposed to care about that character, wherein she’s given no time to develop and the only connection she has to us is a few lines she spoke to the main character which is the loosest form of character development. There is little to no character development throughout the whole story.
The character that seemed interesting before the plot downgraded her was Asuna, the love-interest. She was introduced in the same episode the series began to show its “weak-points” if you will. She started off as a very strong female character, someone who many people could aspire too. She becomes basically second-in-command to the biggest guild in the entire game and is shown as very dominate, willing and caring. As the series goes on, the caring aspect goes way out of proportion as it becomes the only thing she can do: care. She becomes Kirito’s emotional anchor; his soulmate – no longer a badass, independent, strong woman character. The fact that there were other characters that were her eventually downgraded version before the plot made her less interesting than a plank of burnt wood and she was tossed into that crowd is severely disappointing for her character and the audience alike.
The art style and the music seem to be the only things that the series has going for it. The designs of the characters, clothing, weaponry, monsters, and locations – they all look good and appealing to the eye, with fight scenes looking magnificent. The music accompanying those scenes and the series as a whole isn’t bad in itself. It’s very grand and epic, music fitting for an actual video game. While these are the only good aspects of the series, it’s bad when you need something else to be more appealing than the story or characters. The fight scenes look great, yes, but it’s not gratifying enough to acknowledge that your lacklustre characters and plot are enough to keep an audience: you need flashing fighting and ecchi scenarios to be more intriguing than anything else.
Sword Art Online really shows just how emotionally draining it can be during the final episodes. During the fight against the Big Bad, the creator of the game, Kirito becomes impaled with his sword and all hope is seemingly lost. At this moment, it seems that we would be getting a bittersweet ending and that the series would’ve ended on something we wouldn’t call a “high note” but to show you can’t fight your battles alone- Or, you could just break the game and not die. This is when the series knows it’s being ridiculous, by having the main character break the rules of a perfectly designed game. Does it make any sense? No. Is the main character awesome for accidently finding an exploit that should exist in the first place? No. This was the moment a fanfiction writer came into the office, squealed that the main character was about to die and wrote in nonsense. It doesn’t make for a good save and it’s randomness out of nowhere is insanely bad.
Oh, and: it’s revealed that the Big Bad had no motive at all after losing. Fuck. You.
After all that, everyone is freed from Sword Art Online and the two lovebirds can live happily ever- there are still eleven episodes left!? Yes, that’s correct: there is a second season in which Kirito goes into another game that was launched during the time Sword Art Online in order to save Asuna because her mind was transferred into the other game after Kirito saves everyone due to the fact that the creator will marry her while she’s in her comatose state as he wants her family’s riches and- did this just become a lot more ridiculous? It’s odd when the audience thinks that this new plot is strange and may as well not exist.
The second season doesn’t introduce any other worthwhile characters besides Kirito’s cousin, who is in love with him because the harem set-up from the first season won’t die out. It’s a shame that the second season tries to bring back an aspect that wasn’t interesting or even necessary in the first place. Unlike Asuna or his cousin, there was no real development for the other female characters to fall in love with him. Even so, there wasn’t really any development for Asuna or his cousin to fall in love with him either. The romantic aspect of this anime is without a doubt underdeveloped and probably shouldn’t have been one of the themes.  All of this is here to give us a reason to care for badly written, clichéd and unable-to-relate-to characters that could’ve been replaced with rubber gloves filled with acid.
Asuna’s a damsel-in-distress? They just won’t let her be the only good main character, will they?
The second season, shockingly, is a lot better than the first season. The villain actually has a clear motive right from the beginning unlike the previous villain, the relationship between Kirito and his cousin is more elaborate and understandable in contrast to Kirito and anyone else in whole series and the climax isn’t botched up with breaking the rules for no reason. Unlike the climax happening in the game, like in the first season, it happens in real life and it’s very dramatic, something that this series didn’t pull off that well until the final episode.  With that in mind, it can be ridiculous as well and strangely dark. The villain would qualify as a rapist, groping and liking Asuna’s breasts. There are slug monsters which, if given more screen time, would’ve given us some tentacle hentai that would be most unwanted and the fact that his cousin doesn’t know who Kirito is in the game despite the voice and very similar appearance until he mentions Asuna’s name.
This could’ve been a lot better, it really could’ve but it’s just so bad that it’s a wonder why people thought this was good in the first place. A friend of mine said it was good; he was shocked when I said I thought it was bad. For what it’s worth, Sword Art Online will only appeal to those who want action and attractive women that will be used in countless H-Manga. Sword Art Online is bad, though it doesn’t go into the territory of being absolutely terrible. It’s start was great – why did it have to get worse as it went on. Overall, Sword Art Online is a bad anime with bad characters and terrible writing. Avoid it for your own benefit.",3
"
                Here it is! My first review here on the wonderful website on MAL and what better way to kick start my reviews then with one of the most controversial and possibly overrated anime of all time. Of course I'm writing about SAO. 
The story in SAO at first glance seems very interesting and almost desirable. A video game is released in the year 2022 and has each gamer step foot in a virtual VRMMORPG( Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) This seems like an excellent setting for an anime and was something that got me excited for this anime. However what SAO does with
                  this setting simply is the definition of wasted potential. Throughout all of SAO's main story arc it keeps drifting away farther from its core story line. So what is exactly the main story line in SAO? well, you have Kirito our main protagonist in SAO who decides to play this game and try and beat it. Thousands of people enter this virtual gaming world in hopes they can also beat it just like Kirito wants to. However they soon find out that they are trapped inside the game until they beat the final boss. Also if you die in SAO, you die in real life. The first 4 episodes or so really suck you into the world of SAO  but after you meet Kirito's love interest AKA Asuna, the story keeps tumbling down a spiral of never ending boredom and annoying episodes. I really gave up on SAO's story line after the first half of the season where they set SAO in a new MMO. The story never focuses enough on beating the game and more or less focuses on the love between Kirito and Asuna. This is where SAO becomes a real drag and honestly a pain to watch.it becomes Predictable and extremely cliche. Not to mention the story isn't paced what so ever and jumps all over the place.
The art in SAO is one of the things it has going for it. Beautiful in almost every scene especially the action parts of the anime, this show really knows how to show off a cool action scene. The animation is crisp and clean and every major characters' face is detailed and distinctive. This is something I really loved about SAO even if it's all just eye candy.
Another part of SAO's saving graces is the sound and music. The music in each scene is fits very well and is enjoyable to the ear, dare I say even the sad moments felt even more sad due to the music. which is what music should do in every anime. In terms of dub or sub, I would say sub however the dubbed version isn't the worst and is for sure watchable. It may all come down to preference in the long run.
I'm just gonna come out and say SAO has some of the worst characters out there and the most wasted. The two main reasons why SAO's characters are so bad is because 1. They have ZERO and I mean zero development in their personalities. For example Kirito is overpowered from the first episode to the last. Nothing seems like a challenge for Kirito or an obstacle.This makes SAO very boring to watch and soo predictable. My second reason why the characters suck so much in SAO is that there are just too many! You have a harem type thingy going on mid way through the first half of the season where Kirito meets girls who all have a some what of a love interest in him. I don't have a problem with this if only the characters were actually interesting!       
SAO introduces one character and then seems to throw it out like yesterdays trash! It's frustrating when you have multiple characters introduced in an anime yet only two are fully fledged out. In terms of how Asuna's character is, all I can say is that she's the typical Tsundere love interest until they some how fall in love in a video game. I won't even go into detail on Yui's character as I believe she's the most worthless. Oh and also Kirito has a ""Sister"" or cousin who falls in love with him and wants to be with him. Somehow or someway an anime revolved around beating a virtual MMO managed to include an incest story line in the mix. Great job SAO.
Finally, did I enjoy SAO? Sort of, I say this lightly as anyone is even remotely intelligent in terms of anime would know this is an overrated anime full of eye candy and cool effects. Something excites new comers to anime. SAO would've a great anime had it done all the things correctly. I enjoyed the action scenes and awesome music yet dreaded the two main characters who I'm supposed to love and cheer for. In short Sword Art Online was a Colossal disappointment.",5
"
                When I first started watching it, the show was about people stuck in a game world, with the only way being out is to defeat the final boss. Now this can lead to many interesting things, like how the players react to this, to each other, and so on. And the show does in fact reveal some of these things to us. We can see people right off the bat becoming scared and sad that if they die in the game, they die in real life.
So there is nothing wrong with the setting of the story. Except for one little thing, and that is it
                  tries to be too much like the real world. The show has MANY filler scenes where characters yell out the same generic comment about how delicious digital food is. The filler takes up a good two-five minutes per episode. It is in EVERY episode so far. 
Before I comment on another part on how it tries to be like real life, I must first explain the romance in this story. The boy named Kirito is a chick magnet. He attracts every female that comes into contact with him. So you would expect this to be some kind of harem. But it's not! He does pick a girl to romance, and it seems all the other girls acknowledge this. I am going to assume the rest of the show will display what a couple does.
Ok now back to how it tries to be like real life. Like with other MMOs, you can get married. A normal person would know it's not a big deal since it's just a game. But it's treated like a big deal in this virtual world. This is not a problem, it's what a married couple can create that is a problem. The third member of their family isn't really their kid, but they treat her like she's the most important daughter in the world! Within a day of being with her! 
The story itself isn't bad at all, it is just the characters that make it bad. 
The main character, Kirito, is nearly perfect. He grinds, grinds, and grinds to reach very high level and stats. He always has a solution to everything. Every girl he talks to falls for him. To raise the coolness factor with this guy, he receives a new skill (have to avoid spoilers for the poor souls that will still watch this crap). I am trying to think of his flaws right now...and maybe he has problems socializing? Nope, he can get along with anyone, and those he can't get along are just plainly evil or it's not kirito's problem at all.
I didn't think it would be possible for another character to be more perfect than him. A show having two mary stus? lol impossible.
Oh wait, his lover is one too. Except she's even better! And is the root of the food filler scenes. Her only flaw is that she can't live without him. Aka another female character that the writer decides needs a man in her life so she can function properly.
Honestly I was rooting for every bad character there was in the show, even though I knew kirito would dispose of him like yesterday's trash. The side characters are a lot more interesting than these two that's for sure.
Ok now that I'm done with characters and story, I'll move on to the next important aspect of the show, the art. If you can stomach boring perfect characters, long food filler scenes that amount to nothing, and can block out other characters mentioning how strong/cool/beautiful/nice/etc the two main characters are, I am sure you'll enjoy the art. Honestly this is one of the hardest things for an anime studio to mess up on, and that's drawing. 
Although I do have one issue with the art, just one. The swords glow. It glows every time the character does an attack. And it looks really lame. But other then that, the art isn't bad.
Overall I couldn't enjoy the show. I stopped at 12 to save myself from the pain of watching it. I think I'll watch episode 24/25 just to see why the game creator did all this for. If you turn off your brain, I am sure you can enjoy this show too with it's delicious food, and light sabers.",2

                Started this because I was a hardcore gamer once. I thought this would be funny because I heard it follows the main character, Kirito, throughout the completion of Sword Art Online, which happened to be a mmorpg unlike otehr shows about card games and such that never interested me and I always thought were shitboring. 
I think this could have been a good show, a very very entertaining one. BUT only for the people that actually play mmorpgs. Why ? Because there are certain ""inside"" things that ""normal ppl"" wouldn't really understand or better say perceive as being utterly hilarious. 
For example, if you are
                  a gamer like me, you will have fun realizing that the producers MUST DEFINITELY be hardcore players as well, otherwise i doubt it would have been possible for them to reproduce the gaming clishees so closely. You will definitely find yourself thinking ""omg i was also a solo player!"" ""omg this happened to me too when i joined a guild"" ""rofl i also died when tried to open a treasure chest!"" and similar stuff. 
I suppose this show could have turned great for the likes of me IF it only followed the player's experience closely for the entire show. It could have been funny because, you know, when spending hours and days and maybe years playing a game we, the gamers, basically do what SAO's plot is about: we shut ourselves in away from the outside world. Althought we aren't really in a coma like in this show, we live in our virtual pointless space for quite a long time. 
This show could have been intelligent if it somehow managed to mock the gaming experience rather than taking it seriously and thus disappointing, at least me. As an anime show, this is, without a doubt, absolutely terrible. It's basically a harem with annoying girls who pop up every damn episode with their ""noob"" stories, somehow Kirito has to save them (or not if they are out of luck). It's so repetitive that after watching for so long, waiting for the story to actually move on, you finally realize that you are watching an endless arc of fillers. 
Why is this ranked 53?! How can this be ? I agree, the show might get back on track later on, but since for weeks we are just watching fillers, the boring kind of fillers that have no point whatsoever, I had lost hope that it will turn to be the amazing show that I expected it to be after watching first episode. Maybe the high rates were based on people's expectations also, not on actual values of the fillers.
Will continue watching just because I still have hope. But for now this is just a very very big disappointment.",3
"
                Ok so I really wanted to like this anime.  I love the idea of being trapped in an mmo, maybe because I played WoW for a few years.  Unfortunately the writing is god awful.  The story is practically non existant, there's pretty much nothing about advancing in the world and trying to escape.  Each episode seems pretty unrelated and is predictable.  You also literally miss the first 50 or so floors, I understand nobody wants to watch Kirito grind his way up but something here would have been nice.  Whats even worse though is the characters.  Each one
                  of them is pretty cliche and boring with virtually no interesting dialogue.  Kirito for instance is a super powerful and pure  character who looks like he will always do the ""right"" thing.  That looks like there is all there is to his character like we havent seen that in a billion other animes right?  Oh and it is looking like he's gonna have some sort of harem, great as if the show couldn't get anymore superficial.  The art looks really nice, although the fighting scenes aren't interesting whatsoever.  I'll probably give this anime a few more episodes but it's becoming increasingly tedious to watch.",3
"
                (May have minor spoilers, read at your own risk) People are trapped in an online game and if you die in the game, you die in real life.  Sounds great doesn't it?  Well I am afraid that this is actually a very disappointing series (so far).
Note: This is my first review so I'm gonna try really hard to make it not boring.
Story-2: So people are playing an MMO in which they need to beat the top floor of the game in order to beat it, sounds normal right?  So they go floor by floor beating up boss after boss right?  Well
                  no, the first episode they explain more or less how the game works and in the second episode they fight their first boss (its not a spoiler if its completely obvious right?) and theeeeeeeeeeeeeeen they skip around 10 floors.  Then this episode and a few more revolve more around other characters and how they act being in this world.  So at this point I am guessing the story is more about the characters than them beating the game.  This usually isn't a problem for me, although if you want to refer to my opinion on the characters, go to ""Characters:""
tl;dr - Not as advertised 
Art-8: It looks pretty.  What else can I say?  The animation is done pretty well.   I'm not that big on graphics or anything so that's all I will say.
Sound-7:  It doesn't make my ears bleed but I don't particularly love the music in this anime.  The voice acting is actually good.  Nothing much else to say about this.
Character-1:  Cliche as hell.  Main character is obviously the strongest and most well known person in the game, all the pretty girls want him, bad guys are bad for the most generic reasons, and all the characters the show revolves around are boring and forever forgotten (most of them are).
tl;dr - They suck
Enjoyment-4:  It's bad, but its at least a decent time-passer.  Its funny to see how terrible it is.  Reminds me of when I watched Mars of Destruction
Overall-4:  So its an anime about the characters, but the characters suck.  Has a few action scenes (not really) that are ok but they don't happen all that often (weird considering that this is an MMO).  I don't understand why everybody likes this.  It had potential, but it didn't turn out all that great.  Its mediocre at best.  I will continue watching it and update this as unnecessary, but I say you should waste your time doing something else.
tl;dr - Don't watch this, go and do anything else.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Have a great day!",4

                Due to the popularity of Sword Art Online, I decided to give it a chance despite the fact that I have heard divided opinions in regards to the series. In this case, the best way to know is to watch it. Unfortunately, I had to be stubborn to watch through all the episodes. I'll make an attempt to review different points about SAO which will explain why I do not feel that the series deserves as much positive credit as it receives.
I'll begin with the story. At the beginning I became quite positive in regards to SAO as the first couple of episodes had a
                  decent beginning which caught my interest. It passed as a start for the series and I was interested to see where this was head. Sadly, it did not last for more than two episodes. Suddenly the pace became quite ridiculous, there were major plot holes throughout the episodes and some seemed more like fillers than actual story and the quality simply dropped, with an abrupt ending of the first Arc that was not at all satisfactory. In the second Arc, it took a turn for the worse. When I thought that SAO could not become worse, the second Arc appeared with an even worse story, progression and even added fan service which was not at all tasteful. It's a shame, but the quality of the story simply became poor.
While the story was quite the disappointment, the art was not. It was more than decent, even good and I found some enjoyment through that. It isn't perfect, but was quite suitable for what SAO attempted to be. 
Once again, a positive side to SAO. I cannot say that I have any complaints about the sound, not the sound effects nor the voice actors. It may be the case that the sound was the best part of SAO. I cannot consider the sound effects to be too unique, the voice actors to be outstanding nor the OST to be a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it nonetheless, one of the most positive sides to the series.
Unfortunately, there is another part of SAO that I cannot adress other than being negative about it. I am now talking about the characters. I'll adress the main characters, and a general review of supporting characters and villains:
- Kirigaya, Kazuto. Sometimes you can meet unique, interesting characters that really catches your interest which leads to you wanting to see where this character's story leads. With Kirigaya Kazuto, or Kirito, this is not the case. Quite the opposite, Kirito is a generic hero without being unique even the slightest. In fact, there is nothing unique about him. He is the main protagonist, the hero, the prodigy, the ladies man, every generic aspect you can get in a character, Kirito has it.
- Yuuki, Asuna. Tsundere. You may as well forget about the character names and simply give them names by their character progression. Asuna is without a doubt the generic tsundere of SAO. She is without character and while her voice actor does a good enough job, that does not help this lost cause. You all know what happens between the generic hero and the generic tsundere.
- Yui. I suppose the point is that we are to be charmed by this young girl. Personally, that was not the case for me. I guess she can be called the generic moe out of the main characters. It is likely the best description to serve her.
- Supporting characters. I really want to say that the supporting characters of SAO are redeemable, but they are not. Once again, the supporting characters are generic and without qualities that deem them unique or anything special in particular. Generic males from short, skinny and geeky to tall and buff, as generic as can be and the females are no different from characters that appear strong but are not, to characters who are also moe.
- Villains. In SAO, as a setting inside a game, there are boss fights which then excludes the opportunity to introduce a large amount of villains. This should be a positive thing, so that those who are the actual villains can become well-developed. This is not the case. Just like the other characters, the villains are also poor and generic, and the main antagonists have nothing unique about them.
At best, the enjoyment I got out from SAO was decent but for the most part that was not the case. Despite that the setting is in a game, it did not even feel like a game at all. While there were a few points in the first Arc that made it slightly redeemable, the second Arc ruined most of that to the point I rolled my eyes due to the pace, the plotholes, the characters or even the fact that plenty of scenes became predictable. Overall, Sword Art Online does not deserve all the positive credit it has received, instead appearing to me as a poor and wasted attempt at a concept that could have been a lot more interesting. It's a shame.",3

                Sword Art Online... You know, at one point, I was actually really excited about watching this show to the point that it was THE show I was looking forward to that season and all the other shows were just fodder, but as the show went on, and its problems became more and more apparent, I grew a burning hatred for everything about it that it began to define me at one point. Word of advice: Just because something is popular does NOT mean it's good (Just look at Justin Bieber, Twilight, and Call of Duty), as you will learn the hard way with this.
First of
                  all, let me start with that it's about. Sword Art Online is separated into two story arcs. Episodes 1 through 14 is the Aincrad arc. The story is set in the year 2022, the latest VR technology known as NerveGear was released alongside the titular MMORPG. The main character, 14-year old Kazuto Kirigaya (also known as Kirito) is one of the game's 10,000 owners after having beta-tested the game prior. What kind of company produces only 10,000 copies of a game? That's not good business, if you ask me. Anyway, upon starting the game, Kirito learns that there's no logout function. This wasn't a design flaw, but intentionally done by the creator, Akihiko Kayaba. He also explains that the players will die for real if they try to have their NerveGears removed or shut down, or if they die in the game. The only way to escape is by completing the game.
What could've been an enjoyable VR experience becomes nothing but a struggle of life and death. Meanwhile, what could've been an actually good show became a godawful show. What's wrong with this show, you ask? Plenty of reasons.
Let's talk about the characters, mainly the protagonists: For starters, these are not characters. These are bland, unoriginal, one-dimensional cardboard cutouts.
Kazuto/Kirito is basically your standard Gary Stu wish fullfillment protagonist. He has the highest stats in the game, gets all the best skills and items, always wears black clothing to show that he's this dark and emo anti-hero, bends the rules to his advantage to win every battle, and is desired by almost every single female. In other words, being this guy is basically every single socially awkward hardcore gamer's wet dream. He's the main character so everyone that isn't him matters none. Nobody wants to watch an overpowered self-insert bending the rules of the game to his liking. In any real MMO, no single player would see anything Kirito does an impressive, nor will anyone idolize him for doing what is essentially cheating. They would see him as a pathetic loser who has no real skill of his own. And that's what Kirito is: a loser. No matter what anyone tries to say, he's not smart, complex, or badass, let alone a character. He's a walking example of the writinf's complete and utter laziness. 
Asuna Yuuki is probably the worst of the two. She's so stupid, she ends up making Bella Swan from Twilight seem not as stupid in comparison. At first, she seems fine, but as the series progresses and she become a full-time main character, she comes off as your typical tsundere and contributes absolutely nothing at all other than make Kirito do stuff for her and drag him into being a even worse character than usual. Oh and guess what? She's supposedly one of the top players in SAO, but all of her skill points is maxed out only to her cooking stat. That's right, no focusing on any particular stats that would be helpful to progress through the game like strength, vitality, defense, agility, or what have you. The only worthwhile use Asuna has is in the kitchen. To this day, I still laugh at the fact people actually refer to Asuna as a strong female character. In fact, anyone who thinks Asuna is ""a strong female character"" makes me assume that they actually don't know what that even means. I've seen a good amount of actual strong female characters to know full well that Asuna is most definitely not one.
About a fifth into the series run, the story becomes less about surviving in a game of life and death and more about giving Kirito a harem. Like I mentioned before, it's a given rule for any female that cross paths with Kirito to instantly fall for him. Why the chick falls for him is never explained. It sums down to ""I love Kirito-kun because"" and that's it. No reason at all. And when you put Kirito and Asuna together, then it gets really bad. It's bad enough these two are bland characters. But when their romance (For lack of a more suitable word) starts, it's just as bland. They pretty much do nothing that implies romance between the two: She hangs out with him for awhile, shares sandwiches with him, whacks him whenever he accidentally gropes her. An episode or two later, they're in love and they're married. Uh, what? There's no buildup to it that it comes out of nowhere, and what's worse is that romance completely overshadows everything. I mean, THAT is the plot that Sword Art Online focuses around: Not about 10,000 people fighting for their lives in a virtual world, it's about teenage romance that's so undeveloped that it makes you wonder if the writers looked at Atatck of the Clones for inspiration. They selfishly waste two and a half episodes on their honeymoon while everyone else is off progressing through the game. Our protagonists, everyone. Who cares about escaping the game? The script is pretty much godawful, the worst offender being episode 13, where Asuna spews out stuff about how meeting Kirito changed her life and how she believes meeting him was the very reason she put the NerveGear on. It's completely unbelievable and comes off as nothing but BS.
Later on, they adopt this AI girl as their daughter. Her name is Yui and she's arguably competing with Asuna as the worst female. She has absolutely no character and serves no purpose other than desperately try too hard to act cute and be the moeblob that panders to whatever otaku audience. In fact, her introductory episodes was the point where the series quality declined. Also, nothing agains her voice actors. I'm sure they do a good jo bportraying the character but mother of God, Yui sounds horrible. It's like that extremely high-pitched mousey moeblob voice, only alot more grating. She's easily unbearable when she's talking. Like, please stop talking.
Now Akihiko Kayaba, the evil mastermind that is responsible for the deaths of around a third of the game's population: When Kirito finally confronts him and asks what was his motivation for doing this, his answer sums up to ""I forgot."" He even states that he probably had none at all. In the end. SAO's purpose is completely negated and makes you feel like so much time was wasted and so many people lost their lives for absolutely nothing. If that wasn't the most trollish slap-in-the-face since the last few episodes of Blood-C, I don't know what is.
There are only a few characters I like, but they are barely seen at all, let alone given any character development because the story follows only Kirito and considers no one else important. Klein (The guy with the red headband) is the first friend Kirito makes once he enters SAO. You would expect him to be Kirito's wingman or something of the sort, but he's only seen for 5, maybe 6 episodes total. Silica (the loli with the dragon) is one of the more popular characters and she only has a screentime total of one episode and a few cameos here and there. In fact, her only notable scene is walking into the same room with Kirito in her undies. Why even bother introducing these characters if you're not ever going to develop them? Matter of fact, I don't even know why Silica is popular. Because she's a loli. That's basically her only appeal. Same goes for Lisbeth, a blacksmith player, who's, uh... Yeah, what's her appeal? None that I can think of. There's no point in liking any of these females at all. They offer nothing to anything. There's nothing to their character other than she's in love with Kirito-kun. And I think at some point, the author even mentioned that it was hard for him to write a female that doesn't fall for Kirito.
The plot: I've already described the plot. That's it. The rest of the show doesn't ever expand on that premise save for a few minuscule mentions of how many players are still alive. Aside from that, the premise is mostly ignored to the point that it's nonexistant. In fact, through the course of the series, we see the characters with their items and equipment changed only in between episodes. You'd think that a show based in an MMORPG would be focused around character customization, equipment upgrading, skill sets, etc., but it's never elaborated upon. For example, Kirito somehow pulls a dual-wielding skill out of nowhere. How and when he acquired it is never elaborated. He even says it randomly appeared out of nowhere in his skill list. In fact, that's a constant problem: We're only told about this number of played died, but it's never shown. Like the writers just wants us to take their word for it.
Obviously, when we're dealing with a show where anyone can die so you'd expect there'd be some suspense and drama. Nope. Everytime someone dies, the drama falls flat because we haven't known the character long enough to care enough for him or her. A half of an episode isn't enough to for me to know one character! The only ""tragic"" death, according to this series, is Yui's. When she ""dies"", the protagonists bawls their eyes out. They only knew her for less than a few days in-universe, two episodes overall. And it's instantly negated because they manage to salvage her data and convert her into an in-game item. Yui's character arc was one of the worst episodes of the series because of its contrived, weak, forced, sorry excuse for drama. In fact, any sense of suspense is gone when you realize that Kirito will win the fight by pulling straight out of the ass some brand new skill that was never seen before.
The second arc (Episodes 15 through 25) titled Fairy Dance (although you don't really see any fairies dancing until like the last episode), is much, much worse as the many faults are present at a much grander scale. The setting here is ALfheim Online, which was developed using SAO as its base. When Kirito first logs into ALO, he finds that all his items and stats from SAO are carried over. So instead of starting over from Level 1, he becomes overpowered at start. It shows nothing but laziness in terms of game development in-universe and writing out-of. The story switches from ""struggle for survival"" to ""save the princess,"" but there's no real sense of emergency as ALO has a working logout function and no one dies for real if they die in-game. Also, Kirito does mostly everything except his self-stated objective, like it's the last thing on his to-do list.
And just when you couldn't get enough of Yui, she comes back. That's right, she's going Turbo! I mentioned that his items carried over to ALO, but all but Yui can't be read by the game system. She acts as a guide fairy to Kirito, kinda like Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, only even more annoying because she knows about stuff that she shouldn't and it only works whenever the plot demands it.
The Big Bad of Fairy Dance, Nobuyuki Sugou, is way worse than Kayaba in terms of being an effective villain. First of all, this guy is more of a psychotic, pedophilic manchild than a real villain. The first thing he does when we're introduced to him is outright inform Kazuto, ""Hi, I'm the villain."" No subtlety or ambiguity for Mr. Sugou. Also, the fanbase clearly does not hate him for his villainy. His plan basically involves manipulating the memories of the few hundred, Asuna included, that didn't escape SAO. But that's not the reason why the fans want this guy's head on a stick. The most heinous, evil, dastardly, utterly descipable crime against humanity that makes this guy lower than scum is molesting Asuna every chance he gets. To the fanbase, Sugou is Hitler compared to Kayaba.
Speaking of which, the show also portrays Kayaba as the lesser of two evils compared to Sugou, even though the former imprisoned and killed people and is pretty much indirectly responsible for the latter's actions, as well as every other antagonist that follows. While it is true that Sugou's plans are bad, Kayaba's are far worse, yet the show's idea of morality is completely backwards about it. Let's compare: Sugou's crimes only consisted of imprisonment and brainwashing of a few hundred, and sexual assault of one. Kayaba's crimes consist of imprisonment of 10,000 and murder of roughly a third of that number. 
Meanwhile, Asuna is reduced to nothing more than the worst kind of damsel-in-distress. She does more of nothing other than be Sugou's sex toy. She doesn't even try to defend herself or even attempt to push him away, she just sits there and let him have his way with her body. She tries to escape on one ocassion, but ends up getting tentacle raped (Oh, you heard me right) and recaptured just as quickly. Which brings me to my next point. This show is utterly misogynistic to the point that it's outright offensive. The first arc is bad about it, but the second arc is where it is almost blatantly shown in your face. At some point in the climax of the arc, Sugou attempts to rape Asuna in the game right in front of Kirito. This whole scene turns a revenge fantasy and it only serves to make the viewer hate the villain even more, which is not how to even write a villain. And don't even use the excuse ""Well, he's a villain so you're supposed to hate him."" There are other ways to make the viewer hate the villain. Not only that, but when Kirito manages to put a stop to Sugou's actions, he brutally tortures him without any sense of remorse and even commits physical pain to him. While Sugou did basically do the same thing to him, Kirito does it back in an even worse scale and no one, not even Asuna, bats an eye. In fact, she's not the least bit traumatized over that she was sexually assaulted because Kirito saved her so all is good. This is obviously trivialized as a plot device and shows that the author clearly had no business in even toying with such a thing. If you can't write attempted rape without a serious meaning or purpose other than ""all bad guys are rapists"", then don't do it.
As Asuna plays damsel-in-distress, her role as a main character is given to Kazuto's younger sister (actually cousin), Suguha/Leafa. Aside from her huge boobies, she is a somewhat better character than Asuna in that her chemistry with Kazuto/Kirito is actually believable. But her character falls apart because of one fatal flaw: She falls victim to the pitfall of being a female character in SAO, and therefore fall in love with Kirito for no reason (That's right, we're approaching incest territory), only here it's different. She's in love with both Kazuto and Kirito, but she's unaware that they're one and the same. Same goes for Kazuto/Kirito, who's unaware that Leafa is Suguha. So it becomes more of a guessing game as to when they're going to find out, and when they do, the damage is already done and you don't really care anymore. And before anyone says that romantic relations between cousins are acceptable in Japan, let me point out that while that is indeed true, Kazuto and Suguha are not written as siblings and not cousins, which actually makes her falling in love with him all the more pointless and stupid.
Animation: Well, the scenery is nice. That's the only good thing I can say. Character designs, not so much. In case you've figures out, Kazuto/Kirito is an emo antihero, so he dons clothing that is as black as his soul. Black hair, black eyes, Hell, even all but one of his weapons are colored black. Talk about uninspired. Most characters are drawn with only one facial structure. For example, Take Kirito's design, add light-brown waist-length hair, light-brown eyes, and average-size breasts and you've got Asuna. In fact, the moeblob looks like she was recycled from a previous character's design. The action scenes aren't compelling at all, but made cheaply and lazily with single still-frames in almost every fight. There are a few exceptions, but it only means that the animation staff felt like wasting their effort and budget on facepalm-worthy humor instead of quality fighting scenes.
There's only little I can say about the music. I've heard good things about Yuki Kajiura's score and her music here is pretty much the only thing about Sword Art Online worth mentioning. Although it gets very repetitive most of the time. Only one track has stuck to my mind and it only plays whenever Kirito is about to win a fight. It's a shame that it's sadly wasted on something so awful.
Now the very worst fault that Sword Art Online has is its very fanbase itself. Usually, I won't talk about a series' fanbase when judging a series, but this is a special case because of their' foolish blindness to blatantly obvious flaws that even the brain-dead can find. You will find lots of users and their so-called reviews here that praise this show. Those guys are the suckers who was unfortunate to be sold only by its premise, which is interesting but has been done before (Hello, .hack franchise), and ignore everything else. The premise can only go so far, but how it is executed is what really matters.
This show has the stupidest fanbase ever since they probably like anything that looks like a terribly written fanfic written by a teenager. And from what I've heard, Kawahara wrote the first novel (or maybe the preliminary story) when he was a teen. It definitely shows. There is absolutely no effort put into this story and characters whatsoever. And once again, he admits that he basically wrote the story without even applying any form of logic. I'm beginning to think that he didn't write SAO just to tell a story, but so that it can become popular for all the wrong reasons, sell tens and thousands of volumes, and leave quality works underappreciated and selling poorly. Basically, a cheap cash-in. In other words, it's no better than moe junk.
Thank you, Reki Kawahara. Modern anime has gone down the toilet because of your actions.
Here's why I hate this show's fanboys: They said that it would be great. I took their word for it. I enjoyed the first few episodes. But as time went on, my enjoyment decreased as I became aware of flaws, and fans get angry because I didn't enjoy it like they wanted me to. SAO fanboys hate it when someone points out what's wrong with it because SAO is the perfect wish-fulfillment fantasy, and when the ""haters"" question said fantasy by pointing out the issues, fanboys get hostile because they feel offended on a personal level. They can't accept reality because the truth is just too harsh for them.
Sword Art Online is basically a textbook example of how to make an awful anime by relying on wish fullfillment and asspulls to tell the story. It is a power fantasy: Its message is basically telling you to reject your own reality in favor for their fantasy. I think that message is a load of bollocks and shows that some people who falls for this is in need of a reality check. Want an actual MMO anime that does everything that Sword Art Online fails at in that it actually develops its characters, doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator, and doesn't insult your intelligence right in your face? I recommend watching .hack//SIGN for its psychological aspects and meaningfully-written characters and Log Horizon for its world-building aspects and actually thought-out MMO functionality. It's hard for me to actually fathom how this show is so highly rated because it does EVERYTHING wrong on so many levels. The only thing it does right is make itself, and Kawahara, into a complete joke.",1

                “A person is very strong when he seeks to protect something.” - Heathcliff
Sword Art Online; a show loved by many, yet perceived as one of the worst series ever created by a lot of people. The show certainly wasn’t perfect, but it was far from being bad, and I think a lot of the hate it receives is unfair, because it’s just people trying to point out every single little flaw and turn it into something huge.
Story: (7 / 10)
SAO is effectively divided into two large arcs, the first one being what the series was basically “advertised” to be; people are stuck in a game,
                  and have to beat the game to be able to leave. Now, because this arc spans quite a long period of time, two things appear which are worth noting. 
The first one is the slightly “weird” pacing off the show. At times you will see the characters being on say, floor 20 in one episode, and in the next they’re on floor 40, which could easily make you think that you just missed an entire episode. This is not the case, and this was apparently a big problem for some people, and I do agree that the series could’ve benefitted from expanding the first arc to play out over a course of 25 episodes, simply removing the second arc (we’ll talk about this soon). I personally didn’t have much of a problem with the pace, as each episode’s actual content was more than enough to keep me interested, and while it’s not really an appropriate excuse, it may be worth noting that the story plays out like this because that’s how the novel was written...
The second thing is that quite a lot of the episodes in the first arc are not always about directly trying to clear the game, and as such many of them may very well be seen as fillers. These episodes will often be Kirito (the series’ protagonist) helping players of lower level (or anyone else in distress, for that matter), or simply spending time with his friends/loved ones. 
I think it may come as a surprise to some when this series, which you probably thought was gonna be all action-packed and all, turns out to spend so much time on the relationship of two young players, and how they adapt to this new world. 
The show has enough action and fighting scenes to make up for having this slower paced, more SOL-esque section, which I thought was pretty good, nonetheless.
Moving on to the second arc, this is where the story sort of... drops a bit, so to speak. There are some major changes between the two arcs, and it changes a lot of the “core mechanics” around which the first arc was based, as well as replacing the majority of the characters, and basically nullifying that same feeling of danger and suspense the first arc poses.
That’s not to say the story couldn’t be interesting and well-written anyway, but it really has nothing on the previous arc... While I didn’t really dislike it as much as many other people, I certainly found it less entertaining, but to me, the rest of the series more than made up for this part.
Art: (8 / 10)
If nothing else, the art in SAO is simply great. I liked the artstyle, even though it’s really nothing special, as well as the character designs. The animations are fluid most of the time, and the fighting scenes are very enjoyable, and well done if you can overlook the very tiny flaws which present themselves. 
During some scenes, at certain points in the fight (like when someone gets hit), there’ll often be either a very short scene consisting of just a still picture, or a very slowed down scene, to really emphasise that someone did actually hit something. It’s not really a big problem though, as the still pictures are barely shown for any time, and they do look very cool, and I think this all comes down to people nitpicking to find more stuff to complain about. 
The rest of the fighting scenes look totally OK, and the use of “sword art” adds a nice tone to the frames, so to speak. 
Sound: (9 / 10)
The music was also a big plus, in my opinion. The soundtrack is all-in-all pretty great, with a lot of songs both fitting for the more intense fighting scenes, as well as the more “rom-com”-styled parts. The two opening themes, “Crossing Field” by LiSA and “Innocence” by Aoi Eir, are both more upbeat and fast-paced songs, while the two ending themes, “Yume Sekai” by Tomatsu Haruka (the VA of Asuna) and “Overfly” by Haruna Luna, are both slower songs, which is most often more fitting for ending themes. 
I think all of the songs fit the series (and their respective arcs) rather well, and overall there’s really no problem with any of the songs from the series’ soundtrack.
The voice acting isn’t amazing, but it’s good enough, and manages to convey the feelings and messages that wants to be conveyed, so there’s really no problem here either.
Characters: (8 / 10)
One of the most common complaints I see about SAO is “the characters are terribly written”, and I feel like I completely missed this aspect of the show. I actually liked most of the characters, and the ones I didn’t really like that all that much were often the bad guys, so you weren’t really supposed to like them either, which I guess would make them well-written, in a way...
Kirito, our main character, was one of the few beta players of SAO, and this serves as an important plot-element, as he basically knows most things there is to know about the game, making him a very powerful player. At first his primary goal is more or less to just survive, but as he spends more time in Aincrad and starts caring about the people in this new world, his views changes, and soon enough he’ll be the one sacrificing himself and helping out people in need. 
Even though many of the side-characters had rather little screen time compared to other characters (mostly one episode each), they were all very likeable characters, and there was never really a moment where I just wished the episode would end already, so that I didn’t have to see more of this horrible character. 
A lot of the interaction between the various characters served as a sort of “comic relief”, which was nice, and the relationship between Kirito and Asuna is definitely all but “poorly written”. 
As mentioned earlier, the majority of the characters are replaced during the second arc, and because of this I never really cared about the new characters all that much. They just didn’t have enough screen time or impact on anything to really allow me to relate to them, or make any sort of connection.
Enjoyment: (9 / 10)
I first found out about SAO through some random Youtube video mentioning it, and then looking at a quick summary of the plot. Because of this, I really knew nothing about the series except for the fact that it was set in a game world, and a friend had told me that the second half was a major disappointment. 
Maybe it was because of my “ignorance”, or lack of hype about the show that made it so enjoyable to me, but I really didn’t have a problem with anything which people generally complain about. Sure, the second half is slightly worse, but I certainly don’t think it’s enough to mark the series as “bad”.
Conclusion:
If you’re looking for a super serious show about the struggle of 10 thousand people stuck in a game, trying to beat the final boss and avoid death, then this show might not be for you. However, if you’re fine with the aforementioned concept acting as more of a “ground layer” to the series, and having a slightly more light-hearted tone to it, based more around character interaction than just awesome fights, then this may be for you (if you can overlook the flaws and the changes in second arc). 
Pros:
+ Cool concept (even if it wasn’t executed perfectly).
+ Very likeable characters.
+ Very good art.
+ Pretty awesome fighting scenes (most of the time).
+ Superb soundtrack.
-----------------------
Cons:
- Weird pace during first arc.
- Major changes in second arc, makes for a slightly worse second half.
- Very minor “annoyances” during fight scenes.",9

                Some people likes it. Some people hates it. Some people finds it overrated. However, SAO is definitely one of the most anticipated, hyped-up, popular, and controversial anime series of the year. It is one of the most debated series with its various themes, characters, plot, artwork, music, and other factors. The series is adapted from the light novel written by Reki Kawahara, with illustrations by Abec.  It has gained enormously popularity despite the way it originally was created. Indeed, the series has earned mass amount of sales revenue, topping the sales' chart, spawning video games, manga, side stories, and last but not least, the
                  anime series.
The anime series is adapted from the light novels of the same name written by Reki. He is known for his themes of incorporating a boundary between fiction and reality related to the cyber world as one of his other popular works known as Accel World. But that's whole other story. 
I have to admit. I was quite excited with the pilot episode. The idea of being trapped in another virtual environment where our very own lives are at stakes is an eye catcher. It is dangerous. It is deadly. And it puts your skills to the test where you realize it's not longer some virtual game you play for some high score because once you die, it's GAME OVER for real. But of course, Sword Art Online isn't by all means any original piece of work. Series like .hack//Sign, Summer Wars, and even old school series like Digimon Adventures have these themes. Sword Art Online has most of these as sources and presents in a more dangerous way. In other words, it's all or nothing. Once you're logged in, you're not going to get out until you beat the game.
Welcome to Sword Art Online.
The series does bring promising ideas like I've mentioned before. The pilot episode shows the horror of the players' faces where they realize their lives are changed forever. The theme of conquering floors to reach a final boss seems intriguing and some of you watching the series might even wish you were there especially when you were younger and conquering floors yourselves like some classic MMORPG games. The idea of these all sound interesting and SAO makes a good impression at first. However, it doesn't last. 
From the first two episodes, the series maintains its reputation. The promising trailer sticks to its point and we are introduced with some of the main characters. However, it later show signs of shifting apart. Out of nowhere, there are side stories that are presented. Additionally, some of the main supporting characters gets lesser and lesser roles. At some points, it almost feel like a “monster of the week” phenomenon where each episode presents a different side story. Oh, and the dangers of the SAO world seems to be shifted as well. Originally, there were pkers but the idea of them actually becoming a significant threat is weakened from the beginning. It is debatable how this series came together like this from the first few episodes to be honest. I mean, there are stuff of what we mainly see in MMORPG games but some of it just doesn't seem to shine itself.
Now, adaptations aren't easy and fans (especially one with such a large fan base) always expect some greatness. But did SAO achieve greatness? From the first half, certainly not. The side stories' episodes does bring some of the other mechanics and a more detailed way of exploring the SAO world. However, it masks itself of the real story and what's to come. It's almost as if it's purposely making the fans wait for what's to come in these episodes. The way this approach is being handled is a flaw in my perspective as impatience takes ticks is way in.
That's just the first bite of the dish though.
The series does eventually draw its back to the main story but divides itself into two sections – Sword Art Online and later on, ALO or known as ALfheim Online. So essentially, it's almost like watching a two core series in one package with a small break in between. 
The package doesn't stop there though because coming with it is the characterization of the two main characters of the series – Kazuto Kirigaya (Kirito) and Asuna Yuuki. 
Initially, Kirito is one of those loner guys who wants to keep to himself but has a kind and courageous heart who is willing to help others. However, that sort of personality doesn't work well in SAO or any MMORPG especially since joining guilds and conquering beasts requires teamwork and motivation. Thus, he makes friends with other characters throughout the series as well as being an official guild member. 
Now, the friends that Kirito makes are all strangely of the opposite sex, in other words, girls. Yes, they play the game as well and what's more strange is that most of them seems to have a thing for Kirito. As the series progresses, it almost seems as if Kirito is forming a harem of his own. In fact, no girl is safe; Whether you're a beauty, a blacksmith, a beast tamer, or fairy. This is likely due to the fact that he is a much higher level, has a kind heart, and is protrayed as a “Gary Stu” character where he is able to overcome any obstacle with eace. Oh, and let's not forget the Desu Ex Machina factor where Kirito is able to solve an unsolvable problem with some divine intervention. His characterization also has a problem in which his skill level is portrayed as a very high level but the series does not portray on how he manages to obtain a feat. Furthermore, Kirito doesn't really seem to have an interesting personality. The only time he really shines is during his heroic speeches or interacting with the other characters. 
On the other hand, there's Asuna Yuuki. Originally portrayed as an admired girl with equally admiring traits in combat, she is the one that Kirito shares a dynamic relationship the most. In fact, the later episodes explores some of their relationship that began from strangers, to teammates, to friends, and later to something more. As dynamic as that all sounds, it doesn't mix right. Some of the sequences are rushed too much and the deus ex machina factor comes in. Out of nowhere occasionally, the problem becomes a solution where Kirito uses his Gary Stu abilities to solve them with the help of Asuna. However, I do admit that some of the relationship between the duo are relaxing to watch that balances in between the intensity of the fights involving the bosses and the dangers of the SAO world. 
On the ALO side, the series' relationship between the duo is drawn away due to certain circumstances. Oh but that's not all. Another character with admirable tits and a peculiar relationship with Kirito is introduced. The chemistry between them is more of one sided and seems more like just a friend zone scenario till later on when a startling revelation is revealed. It's safe to say that Kirito's development by then has weakly worn down especially with Asuna, yet they remain close at heart.
The overall characterization of the series is only drawn out mediocre at best. Kirito, as I've already mentioned before, is the loner type who only seems to have good spotlights during action and interaction scenes. Asuna on the other hand is seen as a strong girl who often presents herself as entirely different character – sometimes she's a fragile girl with tears, other times, she swings that sword like a boss and shows why she is known as Asuna “The Flash” Yuuki.
Luckily, the concept of the series does remain intact. In other words, the theme of the virtual world is still there. There are the bosses, the floors to be cleared, player environment, items being bought/sold/traded on the market, guilds open to join, and other things you typically seem in the MMORPG world. However, the exploration of these themes are generally just mediocre with no exceptional twists. Furthermore, there are the random fan service themes presented throughout the series with Asuna Yuuki being the star of it all. She is like the desire of what the fans want and sometimes compared to one of the other main characters later on in ALO. (both physically and mentally of course)
Dem graphics:
I will say describe the animation as graphics since the majority of the series is presented in virtual form  in nearly every episode. The artwork is portrayed as being slightly above mediocre. Every environment presented such as the city, guilds, sky, ocean, dungeons, etc are of the typical MMORPG settings. Even some of the monsters fits within the virtual boundaries. The way Kirito dresses is typical with his black outfit and standing out above some of the others. It's no surprise that he looks that way as if he was almost the leader of a wolf pack. On the other hand, Asuna dresses in ways that is portrayed as an female knight. Later on, it becomes more balanced with the duo in some more casual wear. 
The soundtrack and music of the series are alright. The OST curtsey of Yuki Kaijura seems to be limited where we often hear the same rhythms over and over again. The main SAO theme that plays during battle seems also as if it's trademarked to Kirito, especially during his desu ex machina scenes. However, it does get to the point during some of the boss fights where the intensity boils up. The first OP song, ""crossing field"" by LiSA of the first half is actually well presented with some glimpse of foreshadowing and a montage of the supporting characters. The second OP song, ""INNOCENCE"" by Aoi Eir” from the latter half seems to be more of a monotone where we see mostly Kirito and his side with the addition of a new female character. The ED songs are just mediocre, however.
Enjoyment? I'd say this series is just slightly mediocre at best for me. The first arc concludes its story and leaves the viewers to a wondering of what's to come next. The certain events from the arc puts a nail into some of fan's original expectations with the side episodes and fan service being a main factor to blame. Well, the concept is still quite interesting and coming into SAO as an anime fan did satisfy me at that part. However, the characterization and the characters themselves are cliched and flawed along with some of the themes. 
The artwork and soundtrack are there to backup the virtual environment. At times, it's serious and at others, it seems like a romantic comedy. And of course, SAO tries to present these all at once and it just doesn't work out as some may expected to be. To enjoy or not to enjoy? That's the question. It's hard to say really but some of the inconsistencies and weak development of the writings refrained me from giving this a higher score. In the end, this series is viewed from a different perspective to everyone. It's no doubt though that it's one of the most popular series of the year and possibly more to come. I know this review is quite long but time flies fast especially in the virtual world.
Thank you for reading my review :)",6

                The story revolves around Kirito, a young boy who is trapped in a virtual game, where gameover equals the highest penalty: the actual death of the player. Many people might wonder why the novel itself received so much attention. Certainly, the story is not really new to the trend nowadays but it was somewhat ahead of the curve when it was first written in 2002. A well-written plot combines with actions and refreshing romance elements, and put altogether into a fantastic MMO world which can only exist in our imagination – these premises alone are enough to melt the soft hearts of many readers, thus
                  raising its popularity. As the story goes by, there are many things to be amazed by creative minds of the author as he successfully portrayed the beautiful world of Aincrad.
So, to the anime part:
--- Story ---
As a novel reader, I always seperate adapted products (including manga, anime, visual/light novel) into 2 type: the ones which have potential to be good, and those that do not (or has a lower chance of success). In most cases, visual/light novel adaptions hardly tend to be as great as its origin. Sadly, same goes for SAO
SAO well started at two first episode, which could hold the potential to be good as many decent light novel adaption. But as the story goes on, it begins to show a lack of comprehensiveness in plot. 
For example, ""Red nose reindeer"" is a side story in volume 2 which contains a lot of developments and touching scene, as well as deep inner thoughts of the main character, was crammed into the length of a single episode. Despite that, the episode was well delivered, the lack of minor details was acceptable, because audiences were able to feel the tragedy that this episode wanted to portray. However, Episode 4 was a huge disappointment - instead of delivering the regrets of Kirito by highlighting on Silica and Pina relationship like in the LN, the episode was half-heartedly written, and Silica was only a mean to be used. Episode 4 technically ignored Kirito's feelings as he seeks for salvation by saving Silica and her trusted partner. Unnecessary fan services, loli stereotypes fed the audience and ruined this episode, even though it was not supposed to be fun to begin with. For example, Silica could have used her time thinking about Pina, instead of worrying about her appearance in front of Kirito. 
In the following episodes, the anime felt like an episodic series, when random stories happened, most of which were hardly related to the main plot. ""They were only side-stories"" is the perfect excuse for poorly written plot up to this moment, but even so they could have done the side-stories better. That said, the anime still has some positive points which attracts audiences, especially new comers. The plot is interesting, the world of Aincrad is animated realistically on-screen, and the sweet romantic moments between Kirito and Asuna are heart-warming to watch. 
Score: 7.0/10
--- Characters ---
Kirito is first introduced as a lone wolf, an unsociable young boy with great gaming skills. We can see that his character was well developed from the start, with his turning from a solo player into a cooperative player by joining a guild. He began to familiarize with the guild members and share their experiences, joys, and sadness. Then he met Sachi, a girl with an open heart, and gradually realized how important his existence was to others, and figured out his true purpose in life. It would’ve been good if the anime had continued down that road. But instead, he was then built into a cool ""black swordman"" character, aimlessly traveled around Aincard with unclear purposes and did whatever he wanted. To sum up, as the story progresses, Kirito seems to have less depth as a character than he once had in the beginning.
Asuna truly is the most easily-favorited female character this season: Possessing tsun characteristics, a good-looking figure, excellent skills as a player and even great cooking skills, she’s a perfect female partner which can hardly be found in most anime nowadays. But what she still lacks is the screen time to show her romantic feelings for Kirito. She has been in relationship with Kirito for a long time, but with the limited length of an anime episode, it feels like their romantic developments were forced and unnatural. Aside from that, she is portrayed as a energetic, lovely and easily embarrassed girl. Her interactions with Kirito are interesting and somewhat entertaining, relaxing to watch in the whole series. (Oh and it could be considered one of the main reasons to keep audiences watching the show).
Other minor characters have made their appearance as well, but they haven’t present any special traits because of inadequate screen time. Nevertheless, there are a few exception:
Sachi is the shy-type girl who was introduced in episode 3. Just looking at her makes everyone wants to hold her dearly in their arms and protect her. She was one of the few characters that I wanted to stay longer, as one single episode was not enough. Lisbeth is also one of my favorite girl in the show. With her lively traits, she gives Kirito a hard time to deal with and also holds the feelings and antics of any normal girl: filled with happiness when she is in love, smile beautifully when she gathers enough courage to confess, and cry silently when she has a broken heart.
Score: 7.0/10
--- Art works/Animations ---
A-1 pictures are doing a good job adapting SAO into an anime. The sceneries are beautifully drawn as they portray the realistic world of Aincrad, and most of its details seem to fit with what I have imagined when I was reading the novel: from the cloudless blue sky over the vast greenness of the grass field that Kirito always lies on, to the sight of the forest stretched to as far as the horizon, or the barren wasteland in some of the dungeons. 
The colors are bright, but seems unrealistic like Code Geass, or any similar shows which use a same type of colour for each single part on character's body, except there were some shaders which varied to different colours when the lights reflect on. And another thing I do not like, is that having familiarized with art works from novel, I found the art styles to be a little annoying cause it came from the same character designer with Working! (Shingo Adachi). All the characters are somewhat having the ""same face syndrome"", the term describes for itself when every character tends to have similarity in faces, just by changing hair styles and colors to make them look different. 
The battle animations are not very good either, they put up some good battle scenes at first, with smooth animation and lots of frames in a single scene. But all of that quickly became disappointing in several of the subsequent episodes, as there were no actual action scene at all, except some of what can only be called ""slideshow battle sequence"". Nevertheless, when it came to important scenes which requires actual action, they showed some high-quality action sequences. So to conclude, the animation was quite hit-and-miss, but some of its problems are understandable as they can be considered typical ways to reduce budget in anime production.
Score: 7.0/10
--- Music/Sound ---
SAO has a dream team of music/sound production, the famous musician Yuki who composed theme song in Kara no Kyoukai, music in Fate/Zero, Pandora Hearts and many more. Just only her name affirms the high quality of music in SAO. But that alone is not enough, Sho Wanatabe ( Madoka theme song composition, F/Z) also joined her forces. And to top all that, they have LiSA, who is well-known for the works in F/Z and AB!, performed the OP for SAO. These prominent musician make SAO one of the best this season in terms of music quality.
Score: 9.0/10
Enjoyment
When I heard they were going to cram 4 volumes into 25 episode, I knew that the potential for SAO adaption to be as flawless as the original was minimal. [As I've experienced, there are always lack of details, poor developments, several plot holes which affect the flow of story, due to the limited length that any adaption has to face with]. Keeping that in mind, without having any expectation, I watch the anime for its own merits, I enjoy what the adaption has to deliver. Sometimes when they failed to do justice to a scene I like, or leave it out of the script completely, I would feel sad, but I understand that each adaption has its own circumstances, and we - the audiences - have to bear with it.
Score: 9.0/10
---Conclusion---
I know my review is long, but I will appreciate if you read it to the end. I want to say for all those who have dropped the show: give it a few more episode cause the story will be much more interesting and touching in the next couple of episode. It's a bit hasty to drop it right now.

                ""This show is nothing more than childish story with additional adult scenes within it""
Sword art online is a very popular anime, no doubt about it, but however this anime not deserved to be this popular. appalling, horrible, pathetic is the best word to describe this show. Many people love this show too much, without even think how can that happened, why every nonsense scenes or moments occurred. And at the end that's all happened thanks to the main character, why is it? i will explain it later, first of all
The story is centered on anti social people who trapped in a Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer
                  Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online where the player will die for real when their hp reach 0. however its a amazing idea to make a story takes time in the future about virtual reality game, that could make me looking forward to it when this show still on going. The story was great when i know all players in this game will die for real if they not struggle to survive, it makes this show more emotional when some of the characters in the brink of death, but however there is one of the 10.000 players can denied the systems of the game, and ruin the story.
After the episode 15 the story become even worse than before, the story turn into cartoon story for child under 5 years old, where the hero's girlfriend kidnapped by some one strange, and the hero take her back with a miracle that doesn't makes any sense. However too many people said that the story of this show is amazing, but for me this show is nothing more than childish story with additional adult scenes within it.
Even though the story is horrible, the art and sounds was great, i don't know how to explain it, but when you see the art and sound of this show you will think that it will be a great anime, and for me the first time i saw the opening theme of this show i really love this show and thought it would be a great show after all and make me have a high expectation about this show.
Characters, maybe this is why i really hate Sword art online. 
The main character, Kirito is a person who will not giving up something important to him no matter what. He can do anything he want to do, in fact he is the chosen one from the 10.000 other players that exist. He can kill some boss at that game by himself, when the other players need to party around a hundred players to kill the boss. Kirito is just like a god of that world, he can do anything if he want to, even though he cant do that things, a miracles will appears any time !!! 
if you watched this show you will already know that kirito ever in the brink of death situation, not once or twice, but more than 5 times, LOL !!!
Kirito is a normal player but he can defeat the Game Masters in a game Not Once, but twice. No doubt about it, Kirito is a overpowered main character that can do anything that act like a GOD in every game he played, Pathetic.
The other characters is fine, fine doesn't mean its great.
Enjoyment, to be honest, i cant understand how could people enjoy this show. This is annoying, pathetic, horrible too many scenes that doesn't makes any sense. For me this show is really make me suffer, every episodes every scenes make me want to crush my computer and say ""How Could That Happened !!!"".
Overall, this show is annoying, and when i know many people think that this show is great, its just makes this show even more worse. As i said before ""This show is nothing more than childish story with additional adult scenes within it""",3
"
                Right, so i planned to finally update this after finishing all 25 episodes.
As it stands, SAO is one of those anime that either sucks you in enough for you to overlook some of the glaring flaws, or puts you off. And despite how much I enjoyed the anime, it definitely had huge flaws. 
The story itself had a great premise; this is the reason how people are drawn into the anime. Players are trapped in a VR MMO, where death equals death in real life. Because of this, it's a survival test; there are some who would do anything to live, others who help out
                  other people to live, etc. This is the setting that drew me in, that allowed me to enjoy the anime itself.
Speaking of the story, I must note that the two arcs held different enjoyment values for me. Without spoiling much, the first arc captured me to the point where I went through most of the arc in a day, eagerly waiting for the next week's episode. The second arc, though, was a bit less enticing.
However, where the setting shone, the characters... sort of fell. Rather, the development. The plot itself was fine, but the main problem with the characters is that they were too perfect. At a certain point, the two main characters Kirito and Asuna became ""perfect"", in the sense that they had no real ""flaws"" left. Ironically, this becomes a flaw for the series itself, because the characters end up becoming a bit flat. 
On the other hand, the animation of the anime was great. The fights were well done (though full on fights were a bit scarce). The main part i enjoyed was the effective portrayal of an MMO. The menu screens, hp bars, all of that made SAO feel like an actual MMO. You could say it's to be expected, but it was great nonetheless.
The sound was great as well. The first opening, Crossing Field, stands as one of my favorite openings. Perhaps I just like LiSa's songs ( I loved Fate/Zero's opening as well), but I felt it fit the mood of the first arc well. The rest of the music fit well with the story- a gallant theme for the courageous moments, a tranquil theme for the calmer parts, etc.
And now for the bias, the part I talked about earlier. I enjoy anime, and I enjoy MMOs. As a result, SAO just clicked for me. I could look over the character development issue, because the settings enraptured me. If it wasn't for the setting of the plot itself, this anime would really only be a 7 at best. But because the story was so engaging for me, I loved the show, enough to feel the enjoyment of a 10/10 even though there were huge flaws.
For the sake of others who don't have such a preference like mine, the score I'd give it is obvious lower than a 10.
SAO will forever be one of those hate/love animes. It was one of the most hyped anime of the year, and despite its slight disappointments, it well deserves watching if you enjoy the premise of the story itself.",8
"
                First of all, I apologize for my poor writing skills. It's never been my strong suit.
When I first watched Sword Art Online (commonly nicknamed 'SAO'), it was because my friend, whom has an anime taste basically identical to mine, recommended it. At this point only two episodes had been released, and it was my first time watching an anime week by week, instead of watching it all at once like I usually do. I watched the two existing episodes and enjoyed them, but as the weeks went on, both my friend and I were left wondering why he recommended it to me in the first
                  place.
Story:
The story is definitely nothing new. Kid plays video game, kid gets trapped in video game, kid has to escape video game. Of course, this kid (Kazuto Kirigaya, better known as his screen name 'Kirito') got the opportunity to beta test the game for like a day, so obviously he's better than everyone else. The entire show is just Kirito doing cool things, beating bosses alone that people can't even do in groups of 200, and meeting new ""friends"" that only have a few minutes of screentime but still end up considering Kirito their bff. There are ridiculous timeskips, leaving no room for character development, and episodes 3-7 are just filler to make Kirito look cooler. Of course, these episodes, like everything else in this anime, have the potential to contribute to the plot, seeing as he meets some new people. But again, like everything else in the anime, they don't. The characters never show up again until the last episode where they're celebrating Kirito's existence. The show starts out with everyone being trapped inside the game, which develops this fear, because hey, if you were trapped somewhere and if you died in there you died in real life, it'd be kind of scary. But of course, the fear weakens when Kirito easily conquers every boss with no struggle, it weakens even more with the frequent timeskips, and it's completely eliminated when they escape SAO and start the second game, where you can leave any time you want. That's right. In the second arc/game, you are a fairy prancing and flying through the forest, the ultimate goal is to be able to fly forever, and you can log off whenever you want. It completely destroys any suspense there was left, and sucks the fun out of it. Of course, they add one more element in an attempt to add suspense: Asuna is a damsel in distress and Kirito has to save her. Really, really lame.
1/10. SO much wasted potential, it's sickening.
Art:
The only redeeming quality of SAO. The art style is very nice throughout the first arc. It's very pretty and fun to look at. Of course, visual stimulation will only get you so far, especially when they get lazy and start cutting corners in the second arc because they have people hooked already. But in the first arc, the art is very nice, and it was definitely one of the big contributors to my watching it. I wish they would have kept the niceness throughout the second arc, but hey, we can't really expect much from this anime.
8/10.
Sound:
OST is gorgeous. I really enjoyed it. The OPs were fantastic (especially the first one. LiSA is fantastic.), the EDs were good, and the OST as a whole was very, very well done. Voice acting was average (referring to the sub, I'm not going to bother with the dub because that means I have to 1. watch a dub, and 2. rewatch this monstrosity), I don't really have many complaints in this department.
7/10.
Characters:
This is going to be a long section because this is the absolute worst part of SAO. It's not that the characters were bad, none, for the exception of Kirito, were bad characters. But the characters only show up for about five minutes before Kirito decides he's too good for them and moves on. (Though even after he ditches them, they still fawn over him and think he's the *~*~*~~*coolest guy evarrr!!!!!!~*~*~*~. This is literally the entire point of all of the characters. To make Kirito look cool.) Early on, we're introduced to Klein, who in any other anime, would actually contribute to the plot. In this anime, however, he does not. He hangs out with Kirito for the first couple episodes, has Kirito show him the ropes, and then goes on his way. He runs into Kirito a few times throughout the anime, but he contributes almost nothing. Which is extremely disappointing, because I thought he was pretty funny. This is the case with almost all of the other characters Kirito meets (with the exception of Asuna, whom I will get to soon). Kirito meets the character, Kirito helps the character because Kirito is better than everyone else, audience is left expecting the character to join Kirito on his quest because hey, they're on the cover art for Pete's sake!, audience is sorely disappointed when they never show up again because Kirito is a ""lone wolf"" (aka he's too good for everyone and doesn't want to waste his time with them). This happens for a while with the closest thing we get to a heroine, Asuna. Asuna herself, I thought was very cute, and I enjoyed her. But of course, along with all of the other characters, she is only there to make Kirito look cool. They meet, hang out for a while, they part ways... but then they meet up again about two years later. At this point, everyone is like, ""Holy crap! A character besides Kirito that has more than two episodes of screentime!"" and it is a glorious occasion for all. The two hang out for a bit, and suddenly, they're in love! I don't know about you guys, but I don't meet someone, not see them for ~2 years, find them again, spend a day with them, and then fall in love. But Asuna did, and it was one of the worst things to happen to the anime. Asuna was a very enjoyable character until her and Kirito got ""married"", got an in-game house together, and adopted a kid who was probably only a few years younger than them. A good chunk of time is dedicated to the two playing house together, and of course, a good chunk of THAT time is spent trying to make Kirito look cool. Asuna then becomes this lame woobie damsel in distress whom Kirito has to go save. Extremely disappointing. Literally every single girl character, except for *maybe* Silica and Yui because they're like 8, falls in love with Kirito. Including his sister/cousin/who even knows anymore. Yes. You read that right. In the second arc, the main female character is his sister/cousin who is in love with the real world Kirito, but of course, to get over irl!Kirito, she falls in love with gameworld!Kirito. Who is the same guy. This, of course, upsets her greatly because who wouldn't be mentally scarred if they realized that they were in love with their brother? But Kirito doesn't really care. He just likes to look cool.
Due to the fact that every single character is only there to make Kirito look cool, I give characters a 1/10.
Kirito:
I hate this kid so much he gets his own section. Kirito is a teenage boy who likes video games, just like every other teenage boy. He beta tests SAO for like a day, and of course, because of this, he's the SAO master. He can beat anybody in a duel, can solve any mystery, and get any girl. He doesn't join any guild (well, he briefly joins a tiny guild full of people who don't know what they're doing, but they all get killed because Kirito is cocky as hell), which would mean an instant death for any other character, but of course, since Kirito is the best player in all of SAO for some reason, he doesn't need a guild to beat ~75 bosses and the final boss. He just does it all himself, no biggie. Now anybody who has ever played any MMO ever, would agree that this is ridiculous and extremely unrealistic. You play WoW and go into a dungeon alone, you get slaughtered in less than a minute. That's just how it works. You're supposed to go in with a team. But Kirito is too cool for school and goes it alone. And of course, he succeeds. No big deal. Oh, also, he has an ~**~*~ultra secret rare skill that nobody gets but him~**~*~*~. (Aka he gets to wield two swords, which isn't that big of a deal but of course since it's Kirito it means a ton and everyone is amazed. I'm not that surprised that the other characters thought it was cool that he got two swords, since it is an ~**~*~ultra secret rare skill*~**~~*~ that nobody else gets, but they act like he's a god walking among them. But of course, that's no surprise because that's how he's portrayed throughout the entire anime. As a god roaming the virtual streets of SAO.) As previously mentioned, every single girl falls in love with him instantaneously because he's oh so cool and oh so badass. It's ridiculous, unrealistic, and nauseating.
If I could give negative scores, I would give Kirito a -6000/10. But because I have to pick from 1-10, I'll give him a 1/10. That's being pretty generous.
Overall:
SAO is the definition of wasted potential. Kirito is the definition of a Gary Stu. Characters get very little screentime, and are only there to serve the purpose of making Kirito look cool. This is definitely the most disappointing anime I have ever watched, and I feel as if if being exactly like Kirito wasn't every nerdyboy's dream and Asuna wasn't every nerdyboy's dream girl, this anime wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is.
Don't waste your time. Popular =/= good. Overall score: 3/10.",3

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + of the 10000 players now stuck in this intricate mingle.	+ + +  
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + But since most written stories need at least one hero, + +
+ + We will focus on him: + + + + + + + + + Kirito, whose aim to join a guild is near to zero. +  
+ + + After being a beta tester, he‘s kind of overpowered right after the game truly begins. +

+ + + + + + + + + + + + his progress, the show‘s progress, and other. + + + + + + + + + + + +

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + But one of these + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +  + girls is not just there to please + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + but also to master her cooking skills; + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + and so dear Asuna gives our Kirito the thrills, + + + + + + + + + + +  
+ + + + + + + + + + + + abandoning her initial mysterious demeanour for + + + + + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + + + one more obeying, more vain, but not self-reliant anymore. + + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + So now together with these two, + + + the rest is rather simple to review, + + +
+ + + + + as they search for a way + + + + + + + + + + +  to escape this demonical play + + +
+ + + and try to reach the upper floor + + + + + + + + and in between some mundane chore.
+ + Seriously, they go for a fishing + + + + + + + + + + + when others get their final dishing! +
+ Would be amazing if we were shown more trading and bartering, more MMORPG stuff, +
more city life, training battles, world interaction, leveling up; that would have been enough! +
+ I won‘t deny some romance, but in their situation it‘s rather unnecessary and cheesy... +
They have to master conditions queasy, + + + + + + but most of the time it looks too easy +
to build up any more needed suspense, + + + + + so the story slowly becomes less intense
and focuses more on minor sideshows+ + + + + which don‘t possess that much to oppose.
+ It‘s just they don‘t promote the story; + + + + + + + + they are there for Kirito‘s glory. + + +
And so when the action gets more serious, + + + + it‘s bound to jump and stays delirious. +
The story‘s conclusion just feels rushed + + + and basically all side characters are hushed.
And then the second story commences + + + + and requires some other type of defences.
+ I am not willing to spoiler you here + + + + + + + + with the new content that will appear. +
+ Let‘s just say: it‘s decent enough + + + + + + to watch our heroes doing some more stuff.  
+ Cause if you like this kind of games, + + + + + + + + then overcome your inner flames + +
+ and watch this show until the end + + + + + + + + + and you will most likely comprehend +
+ why many of the reviewers here, + + + + + + + despite having rated inside a very low tier,
have actually watched the complete show + + + + without dropping during its entire flow. + +
So yes, the presentation stays mediocre; + + + + + just try to stay calm as if playing poker.
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + + + + + Now to leave the poor story execution behind + + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + and to not let the really weak direction disturb our mind: + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + let‘s focus on the two redeeming points which strongly help this show + + + + + + +
+ + to retain a more subtle inner flow + + + + + + and a smoothly presented outer glow. + +  
The music alone will bear you away, + + + + + sometimes so deep you even can convey + 
yourself right into this world‘s heart, + + + + + + + and together with the richly detailed art, + 
the decent animation flow and more, + + + + + + you get to know sporadical profound lore.  
So while bombarded with more minor + + + + places and people, and praising the designer,
the simple truth is: you will stay tuned + + + + + and endure this anime for opening a wound.
A wound so deep you will likely ask + + + + + + how the director has failed to fulfil his task + 
to use the immense budget for a far+ + + + + more coherent work, and not one this bizarre.
But still this show gets so much hype + + + + + + + quite similar to SnK, it‘s equally unripe. + 
I would say: just watch it for yourself + + + + + + before it catches dust on your virtual shelf!
+ Do not let yourself overconfuse + + + + + + + + by some of the far too harsh troll reviews! 
It‘s your average show, like many other. + + But see, even average doesn‘t always bother.
+ I even rewatch the opening from time + + + + to time just for its beginning‘s catchy prime.  
+ + + + + So I conclude this review by expounding my final point in a clear way: + + + + + + 
+ + + + + do not expect an awesome story, thrilling moments, more bloody prey, + + + + + +
+ + + + + + but instead an anime made out of popular and fan-serving material, + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + +which will at least be entertainment next to your breakfast cereal! + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

                The synopsis of Sword Art Online (SAO) doesn't sound terrible.
If you are expecting a good quality work however, this is not the show to watch. What seems like a promising story, ultimately fails.
I expected SAO to be like Battle Royale. 
Not in terms of the story but how it will be focused on the psyche of the characters. 
Imagine.
Being forced to play a video game, where dying in this game means dying in real life. Every extra day you spend in this game, you stay motionless in real life. This will lead to (possibly permanent) paralysis and most likely, they are feeding you through a
                  tube. This is expensive and your family and friends are in great distress.
This is not a pleasant or/and peaceful scenario. Yet this is not reflected properly in the characters. What I mean by ""properly"" is having short-term and long-term impacts. Simply reacting is insufficient for a ""proper"" believable behaviour. Short-term impacts are the basis of long-term impacts. This must flow in a logical sense for a reasonable duration of progression and regression. Forgetting it the next scene as if it never happened, is the worst method of characterization. 
This is why SAO ultimately fails. It does not develop the mental chaos, which is really the highlight of SAO-esque story. Due to this, everything falls apart. Especially, the characters. 
-ART-
It's typical video game clothing. So I will not bash on how non-functional they are.(as video games tends to do that) But none of them are really that aesthetically pleasing or designed well according to the scenario. So, I give it a 4/10. 
-SOUND-
Music should be used in harmony to create mood. 
Few poor attempts have been made but overall, it fails to evoke anything out of the viewers. This is surprising, considering they chose the simple ""tried-and-proven"" type of music.
-CHARACTER-
Flat as a cardboard.
Though we do not know the motivation behind why the character acts in the way they do, there is no sense of cohesion. 
The inconsistency of Asuna and Kirito is mesmerizing. It's like they are a different person every scene.
Even if the author doesn't tell you the back story of a character, there should still be a cohesive feeling behind their actions.
Is Kirito selfish person? If so, all his action should follow this to a certain extent.
Asuna moves away from Kirito and wants to be left alone at first. But after the boss fight, she even chases after Kirito. Why? 
-ENJOYMENT-
This is absolutely subjective because I cannot enjoy poor quality work.
-OVERALL-
I give MAL ratings based on the word.
3 = poor 
4=  decent.
This is not decent by any means. It fails to develop any of the potential the story holds and does the remainder in a poor quality fashion.
SAO sits somewhere between 2/10 to 3/10.",3

                As the most hyped show in 2012, Sword Art Online is known to be one of the most argued show that exists.  With one side saying its the best thing ever, and one side saying it's complete shite.  Nonetheless, onto the review.
Story: In the year 2022, technology has advanced so far that people are able to put themselves into a virtual reality via a helmet which can transport people into a virtual realm.  This has led to the development of one of the most anticipated games, Sword Art Online.  With 10,000 people being allowed to play this game, everyone who has
                  a copy begins playing, and exploring the new virtual reality, until a few minutes after playing, the creator of SAO, Akihiko Kayaba comes in and tells the 10,000 that they are not able to leave the game until it is cleared.  This is all going great for the people in said game till, and I quote from our main protagonist, ""If I die in the game, I die in real life!""  And the story ensues from there.  From the way the story is set up, great things are expected to happen as the first 3 episodes are gripping and exciting, brimming with pain and misery from being in a game.  That is, until the story decides to go into side stories for about 5-6 episodes.  In the later half in the show regarding a game called Alfiem Online, or ALO, well, yeah.  The arc itself is about fairies, which I'm personally fine with.  The execution and the premise of it was horrible in the least.  Let's just say the pacing isn't exactly THE best thing to come out of SAO.  
Characters: First up, is Kazuto Kirigaya, or Kirito, as his username entails.  As a shut-in who focuses his time mainly on playing games, (sounds familiar, eh?) Kazuto doesn't show much interaction in the beginning of the show since he is a solo player and a loner.  It isn't until a tragic accident in episode 3, that changes Kazuto forever, urging him to finish the game as soon as possible.  Beyond that, well, nothing else happens.  If I was to explain him in the later episodes, I would phrase it as an overpowered player who really could care less about anything other then his girlfriend.  Yeah.  Next, Asuna Yuuki.  As the main female protagonist, she is shown at the beginning to be a strongheaded and focused player who ends up becoming a powerful player thanks to Kazuto's advice.  Although, as the series progresses, the badass attitude that she has early on, develops into well, a needy girl who needs her boyfriend to live.  Then we have the rest of the ""main"" cast such as Kazuto's ""sister"" Suguha, the loli Ayano (Silica), the blacksmith Rika, (lisbeth), the comic relief Ryotaro (Klein), the AI child Yui, and the awesome mace wielder, Agil.  Beyond that, we have a whole cast of side characters that get about 20 minutes at most of screen time which have no worth in mentioning.  (Figure out the antagonists for yourselves.)
Animation and sound: Animation is a huge plus for this anime.  With extremely detailed characters and beautiful scenery that looked like it was painted by Shiina from Sakurasou, SAO has some of the best animation quality to ever exist in anime ever.  Another great thing is the fluidity that existed within SAO's battle scenes.  From seeing the sword skills and the fantastic fight scenes, SAO truly has some of the best animation ever.  For music, SAO has great tracks as well.  Quoting only a few of the wonderful selections are ""Crossing field"", ""Innocence"", and my personal favorite, ""Swordland"".  The 3 of them serve there purposes as the openings and the battle music.  All of them sound great and the opening animations themselves look fantastic.  (Except for the dub's rendition of the opening.)  As of the making of this review, SAO has crossed over into english and the dub is well, adequate.  While the majority of the voices do match very well with the characters they are put into, Aniplex really screwed up on a select few.  The most prominent one is Asuna.  To me, Asuna's voice in the dub sounds like a 9 year old and it irritates me how she sounds really, really whiny.  I sincerely wished they recasted her.  However, the voice actors do portray emotions when they speak in certain scenes, and that's commendable considering that many dubs have fallen quite flat.
Personal enjoyment: Regardless of how much I butchered this show to its very core, SAO to me, was enjoyable to watch.  If there are any MMORPG players out there, I would highly recommend this, seeing as how the anime is basically based in an MMORPG world.  Though the plot was complete crap in development and pacing, there was something keeping me to watch more of it.  Like seriously, I couldn't stop watching this.  Because of that, I'm in the half-n-half camp where I like SAO, but it could be better.  With all the potential that it had in the first 3 episodes, it's a shame how badly executed it was later in the episodes.  If I was to change this show, I would say to completely get rid of the whole second arc and focus solely on the first arc for 2 reasons.  First, it's called SAO, not ALO.  So getting rid of the second arc would make a lot of sense due to the anime's namesake.  Second, is character development.  Because there is a 2 year gap between the first half and the second half in the first arc, expanding the first arc to 25 episodes rather then 15 would make so much more room for character development.  Kazuto and Asuna's relationship was very rushed, and the expanded amount of time could make their relationship more meaningful then it was.  Also, because SAO's concept was so much better then ALO's.  So, if you are an MMORPG player, this is an anime for you!  
Little note: Just because my profile pic is Kazuto, does not mean that SAO is the best thing ever.  I simply loved the character design.  Hell, I even based my own character off of him.",8
"
                Whew, this is my first review, hope it goes well. Not normally one to write reviews but I feel like I needed to comment on SAO. I would just like to remind everyone below that this is a matter of opinion, and I am just trying to express my opinion on SAO.
SAO is somehow EXTREMELY popular, not exactly sure why, and before you rate this a thumbs down fan boys, read this review first.
Story (3) - As I'm sure you are all aware of, SAO is based on VRMMORPGS, which basically let you jump into a game as if it is real life. To say
                  the least, the story isn't very original. Instead of having an interesting, unique, and original plot, the anime relies more on things like ""plot"" (.)(.) 
Art (8) - Animation throughout the series is well done. Other than a few shortcuts that are taken in the animation, it is very high quality. Props to that.
Sound (9) - SFX and music are well done and match the settings.
Character (2) - In my opinion, this is the point that is quite the stickler for me. As long as there is likable, and well developed characters, I tend to watch an anime. However, in the case of SAO, there is little to no character development. Other than Kirito, Asuna, and later Yui and Sugaha. All other characters show up for 1 or 2 episodes and leave, only to show up at the very end of the series. Furthermore, those four characters are filled with problems themselves. Kirito is much too perfect, being able to do anything even though there was no mention of it in the past episodes. In fact, in the beginning, he was just mentioned as a ""normal"" guy who plays video games. Asuna is quite the annoying tsundere that seems to have bipolar disorder. Her personality frequently changes without any cause behind it. Yui is lolicon bait and Sugaha is...yeah. Viewers are unable to make out their own opinion of the character, and are instead forced to take the opinion that the anime basically shoves in the viewers face. Basically, blunt and pointless actions are used to define the characters and are anything but subtle. Furthermore, villains are your everyday generic villains with no variety at all, other than poor reasoning behind their actions.
Enjoyment (4) - Putting aside poor characterization, plot holes, and other major and minor issues, the first arc of SAO was enjoyable.There was humor and it was just fun to watch. However, the second arc, Alfheim Online, was rushed. Characters in the Alfheim arc somehow become even worse than the first arc and it is not in the slightest bit enjoyable at all. Things got too serious and the entire arc just seemed pointless.
Overall (4) - Overall, this anime was poorly done. Although the sound and art was well done, an anime is nothing without either or both story and characters. In this case, SAO lacks both. However, the first arc was quite enjoyable in some aspects of humor. Therefore, I would give Sword Art Online a 4.",3
"
                Sword Art Online is an either hit or miss anime. With the whole idea of depicting a future where the games you love can have real life consequences, SAO had alot of potential to illustrate real life conflicts we are currently facing with our boom in technology. However, it definitely only used a fraction of its potential, that I feel like could have been alleviated by making more episodes that could cover up many of the plotholes it fails to explain, with the story and characters being especially fragile. 
Story: The storyline of SAO could be summed up as very jumpy and inconsistent. The first
                  season was filled with a bunch of characters that the main character, Kirito, had to interact with on his journey to beat SAO. Despite them feeling like fillers, I really enjoyed them, and how they were representative of potential future interactions in MMORPGs. I found the relationship between Kirito and Asuna to be especially touching, and definitely the best part of the series, despite it being little cliche. The series did annoy me with its random time skips and inadequate explanation of the game's mechanics, but for 25 episodes, I realized that they definitely made a good effort at it. 
Although the first arc of the series maintained a fast and pleasant pace, the second half of the series really tries to divert your attention to something entirely different from what the first half established. The entire ALO arc just felt very forced, and definitely slowed down the pace of the anime, taking a sharp turn away from the development of the two main characters in the first half of the series. I am probably not alone in my opinion that the ALO arc just felt no sense of urgency, that the SAO arc created. The last few episodes just felt significantly less motivated than they were for the SAO arc, and in the end, just felt like the characters were taking a game way too seriously. While the first half may have been one of my most lovable animes, I feel like I need to separate it from the second half, that just displays one of the biggest dips in quality I have ever seen in anime. 
Art and Sound: There were obviously very high production values involved in the creation of the anime. The battle scenes and scenery were definitely one of the highlights of the show, with lots of details and vibrant colors. The soundtrack was also very good in my opinion, with several amazing battle/piano soundtracks, in addition to some of the best OP and EDs I have heard. The characters had extremely well made designs, which probably contributed to an overwhelming number of SAO cosplays. 
Character: I can honestly say that if you do not like the main characters, this is not the anime for you to watch. The personalities of the characters are pretty much the only things they have going for them. Most of the characters are quickly forgotten after a single episode, after (I know this sounds harsh) serving their purposes as sort of a side quest. Despite that, I found two of the characters to be very lovable: Kirito and Asuna. The greatest reason I continued watching was because I wanted to see where their relationship led them, and after the heartwretching emotions I felt towards the end of the SAO arc, I anticipated an equally or maybe even better conclusion to the series. However, the inclusion of the sister's relationship just seemed very irrelevant and out of place, and towards the end of the series, felt like it added unnecessary drama that contributed very little to the emotional impact of the series, and only created extremely awkward situations. The ALO arc completely took away from the relationship that was very well progressed and built up in the SAO arc, and despite how much I loved Kirito and Asuna's relationship in the first half, I found myself forgetting the emotions I felt as I watched through the second half. 
SAO is a great and fun anime if you simply just try not to think too hard about its flaws, and try to relate to the characters. While I feel many of the haters of this anime have their points, they are missing the real point of any anime: the enjoyment and emotional aftereffect they feel after it is over. Despite having a weak and inconsistent storyline and fickle and unnecessary character development, SAO was honestly a very enjoyable watch if you focus more on the adventure, and put yourself in the shoes of a character in the series. SAO will definitely strike a chord in the hearts of people who have known how great the adventure and thrill of playing a MMO can be. SAO translates those desires to anime form, and brings out some of the very best experiences you could possibly have in a future that may include virtual reality.",8

                SAO is the gold standard of wasted potential. 
★☆☆☆
All two of my followers have been yelling at me to review this masterpiece—and it’s shit. I’ve never watched anything so hyped and so disappointing. The premise was so good only to be squandered like a lottery winner on cocaine and hookers.
10,000 players are trapped inside an MMO. To get out they need to pass 100 levels, beat the final boss, and if they die in the game they die in real life.
Just reading that premise set my imagination on fire. Two sentences had my mouth drooling with excitement. It was such an ambitious idea. I imagined
                  an elite team of writers must’ve worked on it; men and women assembled from every corner of Japan. I imagined suspense, thrills, moral dilemmas, really dark shit happening. God help those girls trapped in there. It would’ve been a commentary on the human condition when put under extreme circumstances. And it’s a video game themed? Oh, Lordy, you convinced me at “the.” I’ll buy six copies.
Then I finally watched it, and it was garbage.
- Don’t expect any tension, tragedy or even a struggle.
- Don’t expect complex interpersonal or political conflicts.
- Don’t expect commentary on the human condition, moral dilemmas, or psychology.
- Don’t expect clever strategy or mind games.
- Don’t expect anything resembling real-life MMO culture.
- Don’t expect relatable characters or witty dialogue.
- Whatever your expectations are, throw them out, and lower them even further.
I don’t know where to begin. SAO fails on every level of basic writing. Let’s be fair: I usually don’t buy into hype, but SAO’s premise has it built in. There’s nothing modest about its idea, and when you can’t deliver don’t be fucking surprised when you get enough hatred to power a Tesla. If you handed this story to your professor you’d be given an F and asked if you stole this off FanFiction.net.
If you must check out this garbage, I strongly recommend seeing the first episode; then imagining the studio burned down killing all its staff; and episode one was the only surviving copy because SAO peaks at episode one. I wish I were kidding, but I’m not. The rest of the show drops the amazing premise to become a poorly written, amateur harem romance. It’s like you’re watching Schindler’s List then it suddenly becomes American Pie.
I don’t know too much about the writer, but he’s shown to be in the same amazing league as kids who shop at Hot Topic. How oblivious are you to not see how terrible your main character is? The main character has been described over and over as a “Gary Stu.” It’s a play on words from Mary Sue, a character type that’s basically just too perfect. SAO’s main character cannot escape even the lowest standard of a Gary Stu.
Let’s see. He’s too good looking because even another dude mentioned how attractive he was. He’s too powerful; taking down bosses and groups of people with no issues. Great way to build tension there. He gets all the girls because in a game where there’s a much lower population of female players he just gets all the hot bitches with no effort. He’s fucking boring. I cannot even begin to describe his personality other than just existing. And this is the worst crime: he wears all black. I’m not kidding. His entire outfit is a black trench coat, black fingerless gloves, even his fucking sword is black.
Look, I get it. It’s hard to write a main character. You want them to be likeable. They’re the face of the show, but SAO’s main character is nothing less than masturbatory wish fulfillment. Because writers want their characters to be liked they end up bland and uninteresting trying to appeal to everyone. It’s okay to have a character that isn’t liked. There’s a difference between not liking them as a person and not liking them as a character. That’s why villains are so much fun. You’d be horrified at their shit in real life, but in a story they’re fun and engaging. Most of all, make your main character relatable, and SAO’s main guy is none of that.
His Mary Sue love interest isn’t any better. In the first episode she comes off a mysterious, independent woman only to melt into a damsel in distress. She’s also a guild leader, and she has a very high cooking skill level. Where the fuck did you find the time to learn that when you’re leading players to escape the game with their lives? Are you guys even trying?
The pacing is all over the place. If you’re going through 100 levels I expect 50 episodes. But, no, the show skips dozens of floors without any sense of time. Shit just happens. The story is bogged down by incredibly vapid slice-of-life episodes. You have a whole fucking world of engaging stories, but you focus on Gary Stu and Mary Sue going off to a lake house and fishing. Goddamn, remembering this shit makes me mad.
Good pacing is gives a sense of struggle. You have your high point then your low point then another high point then another low point and so on. This is called writing. The worst sin is how they just glossed over 2,000 players dying. Not even a montage. They just mention it like a footnote. So much shit happens off screen why bother even having an anime?
And if this show had even attempted to meet its ambitious premise then the final 10 floors would’ve been the most agonizing, most intense, most tragic episodes where any hope of making out alive would’ve  seemed impossible. But, nope, more harem shit.
Okay, fine, now you have a romance. I have to accept it, but it’s not even a good romance. A romance needs engaging characters, but when you have Gary Stu and Mary Sue I might as well be looking at a brochure. Two pretty people like each other and that’s it.
Is there anything I liked about this trash? I guess soundtrack was nice. The fantasy landscape and scenery was nostalgic to look at. Reminded me of my Runescape days. And when they did incorporate some MMO elements like messages and inventory that was kinda neat. Wish there was more of that shit.
I dropped this after episode 14 because—and this unbelievable—they escape the MMO, and everything goes even deeper into shit.
I don’t understand the hype for this show or why it’s so popular. My theory is that because there’s always an influx of new anime fans that they don’t grow up watching older stuff so they don’t develop taste like older anime fans.
You’re not supposed to watch only anime. You need to enjoy all sorts of entertainment from movies, books, TV shows, and video games. That’s how you refine your taste. I suspect SAO is a lot of people’s gateway anime in the same way Dragon Ball Z and Naruto are.",3
"
                This is a a rewriting of my first review since I was ranting a lot in that, so this time I wil try not to rant and will use the usual swear words like fuck cause I used the n-word before, anyway, here we go ;_;
""A person is very strong when he seeks to protect something. I’ll expect a good fight.""
I feel sorry for people like me who somehow watched all of this, I think you'll know why. So SAO 2 is gonna be finishing up soon, so you know what that means, we gotta review the first season *sighs* welp lets get this over
                  with. The thought of this makes me wanna barf. The story fails so many basic things. The charcters could be good but just get ignored like they were nothing. The music and animation are pretty solid but that dosen't make up for anything. And enjoyment comes from the mindless action and thats really it. A-1, are you even trying with this show?
Story and characters: 2/10
No seriously A-1, like seriously. So this is set in the near future were humanity have now accomplished Virtual Reality MMOs (VRMMOs for short) so everything is going well until, a game called Sword art Online (hence name of the show) is released. So as it gets launched everything goes fine until people realize, there's no logout button. Then it turns out the only way to get out is to complete all 100 floors, and there's a twist, if you die, you die for realsies. OH PAPER SHEETS! So this would probably be some Fantasy Action right? Well sadly, this also falls into the genres of Romance and harem.... so answered yet A-1? The bad thing is this fails so badly in basic things cause of, the MC. lets go on to him.
Kirito, so Kirito is the MC here and well, he really boring and bland. Even the stuff he says is bland. But somehow when he meets female characters (hence harem) they somehow fall in love with him... Either he's unbelievebly sexy and has a huge D or just anime logic. But really this is lazy, have a reason for why these people fall in love with him? Now male characters you ask, well the good thing is they don't fall for his spell, so thats all good.
Next, another thing about the MC is that the story just focuses on him when in reality he just sucks. When we get introduced to new characters, they get ignored later on until some specific serious thing happens to Kirito. This is another sign of laziness, cause this show dosen't even try on developements.
But, then we have Asuna, when first introduced she's this shy but brave woman who you really like, she knows whats she's doing and is really likable. Then, she meets Kirito -_- this is where she becomes helpless. She goes from Joan of Arc to some generic anime female, she becomes this weaker version of who she once was and it feels like her soul belongs to Kirito and something. Please don't get me started on the fanart and chapter 16.5, like don't bother.
Art: 7/10
The art is pretty nice here, I like it, some really good looking visuals. But this dosen't make up for its laziness of characters. Some scenes the animation may be a little sloppy but they tried.
Sound: 7/10
The music is not bad, some good tunes and some good OPs but meh EDs. It has some memroble tunes but overall good.
Enjoyment: 3/10
So, boring dialouge, convinient ass things, plot holes, no charcter developements, pathetic writing. The only pro would be the action which is actually enjoyable to watch other than that, it dosen't even try.
Overall: 2/10
This is a poor excuse for a plot and characters, I don't know how this even got mainstream? The ending is meh, not much happens and really is there as a Happily ever after vibe. Overall, stay away from this, it dosen't even try.
Rating: Shit would taste better than this.",2

                Oi…………
You know, ever since starting this in 2011, I always keep an open mind when reviewing most anime out there as most people tend to be too dismissive and ranty when it comes to new titles and often say the words, “Anime is DEAD!!” whenever a bad show (or what people perceive as ‘bad’) appears in the broadcast wavelengths and this particular show already has a history of that already in the span of two years and has already gotten its fans and its critics. (And note, I said critics, not haters because…..well, we’ll get to that later).
Sword Art Online (SAO) is a Virtual Reality
                  Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG), released in 2022. With the Nerve Gear, a virtual reality helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds.
On November 6, 2022, the players log in for the first time, and later discover that they are unable to log out. They are then informed by Akihiko Kayaba, SAO's creator, that if they wish to be free, they must reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, if their avatars die in-game, their bodies will also die in the real world. One of these players is Kazuto ""Kirito"" Kirigaya, a skilled player who is determined to beat the game. As the game progresses for two years, Kirito eventually befriends a female player named Asuna with whom he ultimately falls in love. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's avatar Heathcliff in SAO, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.
Now, with a premise like that, it’s something that could be promising and worth to be a watch but unfortunately, that’s only the first episode and maybe the second because as the rest went back, the quality of it got lower and lower as the show went and this is something I watched twice. First time during the simulcast period and second time around the Toonami run with the English dub and I didn’t hate it as much at the first time but the second time viewing it, I really didn’t like what I saw (and no, it’s not because of the English dub).
The show is split into two arcs: The Aincrad Arc and the Fairy Dance Arc. For the Aincrad Arc, I did think that arc was alright at first, but most of the time, I was bored to tears and the pacing of it is way too fast and clumsy. I know some people complain about slow pacing of anime in the past but at least they try to get you immersed into the storyline. They jumped forward to the story too much, leaving out some details that could be important to the story but instead, it’s left out for the romance side story, which really wasn’t that great in the first place. The Fairy Dance Arc was a completely unnecessary arc as forced melodrama took over with either a love triangle that shouldn’t have happened nor did it need to exist and a new game, ALfheim Online, was made even though after the disaster of SAO, you think you would’ve stopped there but nope. The bad quality of the writing shows during this arc, even though the writing for the first one was just uninteresting. It felt like they needed to just do shit for the sake of doing it with no plausible explanation and as far as people saying it was the smartest anime at the time, you got to be kidding me. There is nothing smart or deep about this series and while that might not be a bad thing, it’s not entertaining either and if you can’t be both of those, then you failed to be a good show.
Characters are even worse as most of them don’t really seem that memorable or inspirational. They are quite forgettable. Take the main character, Kazuto Kirigaya, who is the most powerful character in the show because of……..well, fuck if I know. Now I said one time that Kirito wasn’t the perfect character and I may have said that wrongly because it is described as being perfect, perhaps too perfect and with him being the strongest player (or beater) in the game, I have no concern to worry about him. He’s just a generic badass wannabe. We know he can defeat whoever challenges him and that just sucks out the tension of it. 
Kirito is a wish-fulfillment character that guys desperately want to be. And as for Asuna, she could’ve been an alright character and she was for a bit but most of the time, she had some of that tsundere character traits that I really hate but the biggest downfall for her is when her development shrivels down and that confidence in her is just poof, gone and for their romance, it really wasn’t that inspiring as most fans think it is because no relationship like that would ever go like that within the span of the first arc, which I would blame the time skips for and the fact that the second arc shouldn’t have been made at all. The other characters in there doesn’t seem that important at all because the show doesn’t give them that much face time except for either one or two episodes. Klein and Agil were good characters, I give them that but the girls (Yui, Silica, Lisbeth, Sachi, Leafa) all seem like they are part of Kirito’s growing harem of girls that fawn over him, even an AI character that supposed to be Kirito and Asuna’s “daughter” and also his sister…..no, wait, his cousin (as in that love triangle that was pointless to begin with). The villains of the show Akihiko Kayaba and Nobuyuki Sugō (Oberon the Fairy King) have the worst motivations for doing what they did, especially the former whose reason for doing this wasn’t even explained and the latter’s purpose may have some motivation but a piss-poor motivation to do it.
The animation by A-1 Pictures (who made Blue Exorcist, Magi, Fairy Tail, & Anohana) was perceived as stellar to most people and while it looks look visually stunning, it’s not all amazing as some make it out to be. It’s not awful but nothing that I haven’t saw before and as far as some of the action scenes go, they aren’t actually that well-animated.  It has pretty artwork and the character designs does appeal to the standard otaku, which is why they might love the show in first place.
Music-wise, I love Yuki Kajiura and her music but this score is just about average and the same can be said about the opening and ending themes of the show (and I mean, all of them). “Crossing Field” doesn’t really stand out as one of the best themes in an anime and especially from the singer LiSA. I still say to this very day that “Oath Sign” is more of an inspiring theme song than this. 
And now for the dub, which is also average. Yep, in 2013 where Bang Zoom Entertainment proves their dubs are getting better in quality (Fate/Zero, Blue Exorcist, Accel World) than most of what FUNimation or Sentai Filmworks pumps out weekly or monthly, this isn’t their brightest one but it isn’t that horrible of one either. Bryce Papenbrook as Kirito did felt uninspired although in his defense, I think it matches the character rightfully. Cherami Leigh does alright in her starring debut in a LA dub as Asuna. I would say that Todd Haberkorn being one of the villains is expanding his range as a VA but I’ve seen it done before and it felt like how Johnny Yong Bosch was in Fate/Zero (Ok, I’ve been mentioning that show here lately) In short, I do like most of the dub cast in here (like Cassandra Lee Morris, Christine Marie Cabanos, Patrick Seitz aka one of the few guys I don’t mind playing a black man because dude can do that, Kirk Thornton), but I felt they were underutilized.
FINAL VERDICT: OK, there’s no doubt about it. This is just a failure of a show, not a complete failure but damn, this was disappointing. I blame the hype of this as people making it out to be one of the best shows in 2012 when it’s really the most popular title of that year and I’ll say this as many people did, “Just because it’s popular, doesn’t guarantee that it’s any good.” The writing is abysmal, the characters are bland and forgetful. The only praise I get from it was the artwork and the music was just average and I thought .hack/sign was a bore to get through but at least that show had some merits. And I highly say I would NOT recommend this title to many of you unless you need to see it for yourself to show how it is. This is purely one of the many examples of how NOT to write an anime.",3

                i'm sorry, but this review was made with google translator: / sorry if there are serious language fails 
Well this is my first written review and I may spend a couple of things, not contains spoilers quiet;) 
-HISTORY: SAO is an anime that for a true to the online gaming person may appear the best anime in the world (I mean by the good notes by the hype generated when it was freshly emission), but to me it seemed a anime with nothing new with a linear story and very obvious (at most there were 3 chapters in which things happen that I did not
                  expect). 
Within this point also comes something I found unnecessary and was extremely put fanservice scenes that did not come to mind and did not provide anything in an anime that does not need them and that what mattered was the development of the story itself. 
Another point in what turn serious history chapter 7 as it is the typical ""I love you, but you do not know"" (it's cute as all animes that have a chapter as well, which raises some some expectations in my case nO), and finally a somewhat subjective and not objective personnel is: history is bad if you like this world of virtual reality and video games and stuff leed the book ""Ready Player One"" 100 % recommended, the anime story not worth seeing. 3/10 
-Sound: Nothing to say the soundtrack is meh ""good"" is not something that influenced much in the anime, and other voices just ""good."" 7/10 
-Characters: Something important in the anime is the character development as it affects (at least for me) in the enthusiasm with which I see the picture is depressing and SAO Kirito the main character is a flat character has not even a single sentence that makes me remember it, just remember what the end of the series because it always uses black clothes and nothing else, otherwise do not know if I should go to ""character"" is drawing faces, I caused a lots of funny to see how Kirito Kirito meets with orange hair FORGIVENESS meant Asuna. 2/10 
-Art: The point that makes me put a 3 to this anime and not a 1 is drawing landscapes or scenes and light drawing is something that I personally always like to see in the anime and this is used extensively by ""lens flares"", the drawing of the characters is basic not much detail on the character itself, if not in the clothes and nothing else. 7/10 
Final Note 3/10 
Brief review: Boring and over-rated
i recommend? 
NO, if a person is just beginning to watch anime asked me to recommend some would not be this as it may start to hate him (or FMA recommend Steins; Gate anime that are good to start on this)",3
"
                Three. I’ve watched this show three times. Two. I’ve written two reviews for this show but didn’t post them because I didn’t like them. One. This show deserves the one review it has coming to it, to cover the good and bad beyond the visuals and music. After watching this show thrice, can I truly say what makes this show tick?
God help me, let’s begin. Let’s look at Sword Art Online.
The story begins with the launch day of a virtual reality online game called Sword Art Online. But as the day draws to a close, the players find that they can’t log out. Their minds
                  are trapped in the game, and the only means of escape is to clear all 100 floors of Castle Aincrad where the game takes place. And death in the game means death in real life. From here on, it’s worth noting that the concept of a “death video game” is tossed in the sense that there are gameplay mistakes that might be better suited to an alternate world fantasy show.
In fact, the show mostly IS an alternate world fantasy show. That doesn’t entirely excuse the mistakes, but bringing focus to them would be missing the bigger picture. Mistakes are only bad when nothing distracts from them, and for the most part the show is able to distract from them through world building and immersion.
It achieves this world building by greeting viewers with believably strong visuals. It’s not just how vibrant and fluid the visuals look, but the design choices to reflect practicality, to look less like a fantasy and more like something that could really happen. Save for one villain, the designs look at least well armored or fully clothed all over; it’s easy to believe sword and shield users like Heathcliff can charge the frontlines, or why a speedy fighter like Asuna can dance around a fight. There are no skimpy outfits tanking hits or heavy suits zipping all over the place. It looks as practical as it is.
The setting itself is often as down to Earth as a fantasy can get. The 18th century flavor to most of the towns and the undeveloped locales such as the lakeside forest don’t serve to remind the viewer the show is a fantasy, but as a glimpse into the past. It’s a fantasy with the illusion of reality, and avoids being too fantastic to be believed. That is, except for the dungeons and monsters. More mundane creatures tend to lurk the normal fields, with the lizardmen, ogres, and reapers showing up in more and more dungeons that remind viewers this show is indeed a fantasy. A fantasy the players want to wake up from.
All the players, the characters, are simple but personable. I couldn’t describe the well-meaning but perverted Klein or feisty Lizbeth beyond just that, but taken together all the characters give the setting a personality to match how down to Earth it is. It’s simple, but lively. The characters themselves are unexplored, but their stories come to life by expanding on everything the setting has to offer. From the carelessness of low level players in a treasure chest room to a journey for a rare mineral to craft the finest sword, the setting gives action to the characters, and the characters give life to the setting.
There are two certain characters who form the crux of the story, where the viewers see most of the action from. They are Kirito and Asuna, two of the strongest players in the game, but still only a slip away from death via sleep PK, defending a weaker player, or tricked into a bad state. Like the side characters, they’re simple, but the draw here is a couple on equal ground. Their behavior behind closed doors is charming if cheesy, but as they defend and rescue each other from fights, it’s hard not to stare in awe at them as they fight.
The fights themselves are loud, with music going with it that ranges from the energetic and nearly hopeful to the ominous and almost hopeless. But while the battle music makes fights entertaining, it’s eclipsed by the calm and unnoticeable. The town music gives a sense that it’s just another ordinary day in this fantasy world, while other pieces go from nostalgic to ambient. The ambient tracks are used especially well during moments of silence where the dialog becomes the focus. This helps to bring life to the show where it is uneventful, and uneventfulness does happen often.
This is because while the show starts as an action fantasy, it turns into a slice of (fantasy) life. As the days trapped in the game turn to months, more and more players stop trying to clear the game for fear of death, and yet with so few people trying to clear the game the odds of winning begin to slim. It’s this strong subtext of safety VS sacrifice that dampens a holiday celebration or someone going fishing, and makes the move into calmer episodes believable. But whether the show is calm or intense, there are often small reminders that the setting isn’t real beyond some of the monsters and dungeons.
Sometimes a relationship from real life will change in this virtual reality, one character will remind another character of a sister they have in real life, and another character still may scoff at the idea of players really dying if killed in the game. It’s reminders like these that always give the show a sense of weight, to pull viewers—and the players—out of any good feelings that might have been starting to build for the game, where what they might cherish is only a dream. For better or worse, the show is immersive, but not as immersive as it could be with the way the show is paced.
Often times the show will have time skips between episodes, which hurts the immersion like a level select cheat in video games; the more levels one skips, the more disjointed the game feels. From a storytelling standpoint, each time skip goes to something important or at least different from the hours a character might have spent going from level 40 to level 75. And yet, the time skips are still often misused. Some episodes would have been better showing more of the events leading up to it, another episode actually seems to forget the plot point it started with entirely, and Kirito and Asuna’s relationship can feel rushed.
With the immersion being hurt, the mistakes begin to show. So the show is far from perfect. The characters are simple and the pacing and mistakes make the show stumble. But though it trips, it keeps going forward. The world building covers for the characters, and the characters give life to this setting where the show might have skipped over. The setting and characters are fairly down to Earth, where the strength of this fantasy is an illusion of reality. Glued together by strong visuals and music, and the show is very much worth watching.
Of course, this is only talking about the first 14 episodes.
Episodes 15 to 25 is where Sword Art Online changes a lot for the worse. It brings in a new character who’s as personable and simple as any character from the show’s first half. Now, the show’s first half could get away with its simple characters because it had so many and most were only around for one or two episodes at most. They left before wearing out their welcome, but not in the case of this new character. Much of the show focuses on this new character’s feelings for Kirito, but with almost no other characters to cover for her simplicity, she can’t even give the image of being a compelling character.
But while this new character is just decent, Kirito goes from decent to offensive with a lack of sincerity on his character. At the start of the show’s second half, it’s hard not to feel sorry for him as a certain plot point becomes his driving motivation. And yet, for much of the show’s second half, he has almost no sense of urgency despite how devastated he initially is, until the plot demands it. There is actually a scene where he says he’ll get revenge on the villain, only for another character to remind him of his actual reason for fighting, to where Kirito says “oh, right” as if he were running an errand. I’m not joking.
It’s easy to get why the show becomes less action heavy in the first half, but Kirito’s lack of sincerity in the show’s second half is baffling. As for Asuna, she doesn’t degrade as a character, though the story’s treatment of her goes down. Now, I don’t have a problem with showing a strong character as vulnerable, changing someone’s role in the story, or what have you, but in the show’s second half the writers have done everything in their power to outright disrespect her image from the show’s first half. There are more tasteful ways to show weakness than softcore porn.
The other characters are even worse. Most of them are shoved to appear all at once in one or two episodes, with their roles in the story being nothing more than to serve as fight fodder or to give info dumps about the setting. There’s no time for them to give the world a personality, they have no personality to start with, and the world itself has almost no immersion with so many of its aspects being crammed. Of course, the show’s second half is a more personal tale about Kirito and the new character, but only the new character is worth something since Kirito is insincere.
But Sword Art Online isn’t a personal tale. Though the show’s first half does focus on Kirito and Asuna, it’s more about what they learn from the world and other characters around them than their own thoughts. The show’s first half has simple characters, but they don’t overstay their welcome. Though the show’s pacing hurts it, it makes up for it with world building that can make these personable but simple characters something more. The show’s second half has none of this, and to make it a personal tale when it worked much better as a grand story becomes its downfall.
With the world building gone, the mistakes really surface and soon the show has more questions than answers. Conflicts between player factions amount to nothing, fight scenes are bland when thinking about their new powers, and the over the top villain is more annoying than threatening. Except for Kirito, Asuna, and the new character, the show does away with its down to Earth characters and setting, further ruining the immersion as it hammers the viewers head with the message that this is a fantasy. This aesthetic change would have worked if the setting and characters were at least decently fleshed out, but they aren’t.
So why couldn’t the show stop at episode 14? The show’s first half is far from perfect, but the love and energy put into it really shows. But the show’s second half is a cash-in focused on the wrong thing and somehow made that thing worse. In a way, the launch day of Sword Art Online is much like watching this show; everyone is immersed by it, but by the time the evening hours come along, everyone regrets ever starting this game. The good news is the viewers can log out, and I suggest doing so after the show’s first half. But if I’m saying that, then I question if Sword Art Online is worth logging into.",6
"
                SAO is about as generic as an anime can get. I was really excited to see a .HACK styled anime outside of the franchise; expecting some new inputs from an outside perspective. I am sadly disappointed by SAO, it started off like an even darker .HACK//SIGN and quickly turned into light-hearted romance where they insert as many anime clichés as humanly possible. Without further ado let's get into it.
STORY:
SAO does not have a well developed story, and it is not the kind of anime that can survive on near episodic content and filler. Continuity and consequence are pretty much ignored because of the way time
                  jumps around ""someone dies, oh well they might as well have never existed as of the next episode"" and ""I'm forced into a situation I don't want to be in, good thing time can jump forward and just give a vague reason why this is no longer the case."" That aside SAO's biggest problem in my opinion would be that the story seems like it was written by several people and none of them talked to each other. The story starts off as a bit of a dark action story but you can tell by the way the plot is set-up (climb to the top of the tower) that it will become an action-adventure story and it does, very briefly, before it transcends into what every person watching an anime based in an action-MMO wants: A slice of life romance, because that's what we all wanted... right? Although there is a clear goal to the series, there does not appear to be much in the way of direction, at least that we actually get to see. Other than the occasional downing of a boss we mainly get to see the lives of Kirito and Asuna as they fall in love and eat sandwiches. The lack of an antagonist is annoying, even more-so because it's somewhat predictable as to what is going to happen. (NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS SPECULATION but it's probably true) the game creator is an obvious choice but since there'd be no way to defeat him outside of finishing the game and getting him in person, the creator is likely playing the game and just for the M Night Shamalan twist he is probably a character we've already met disguised as a good guy (I'm confident in all of that but the last bit but that is basically an example of how generic this is.) Which brings us to characters.
CHARACTERS: 
They're bad, they're soo soo bad. I don't mind an OP character, in fact I prefer them, I don't want to watch 100 different anime all about some guy who is kind of emo and not very good at anything and then watch him grow and overcome his hardships to finally become a pokemon master, or whatever. I love watching badass main characters just be amazing and overcome incredibly difficult challenges in a creative way instead of struggling through it over 5 episodes. I don't mind that Kirito is strong, I'm not a big fan of the super secret trump card, especially when it's as lame as his is (to be honest pretty bad game design that his secret ability wasn't available to everyone.) Kirito starts off as a smart calculated loner (overdone but hey at leasts he's not emo) he quickly turns emo (damn!) and drops about 10-20 points in IQ, now at this point in watching he becomes a happy-go-lucky love bird with a sense of justice also an optimist. Next up is Asuna, a shy antisocial girl who has never played an MMO also pretty and smart. Jump to the future, she's one of the most powerful characters, talks to everyone, and is a high-ranked outgoing member of a guild also a tsundere. Jump again to the lovey-dovey girl completely overshadowed by her boyfriend and is entirely too emotional and cooks of course. I'd talk about some of the side characters but they're pretty much all dead. Other than Klein and the girls who will likely make an appearance as love rivals because there isn't enough generic romance in the series, there aren't many returning characters so far.
ART:
It's great, their is a great use of colours and even the UI looks sleek and nice. Backgrounds are drawn well and tend to reflect the mood very well. The animation for the action sequences is actually quite nice though the action is a bit sparse.
SOUND: 
I would not at all be surprised if someone told me this anime existed to show off the music, it's implemented quite well and overall there's a high quality pick. The voice acting is fairly good for most characters.
ENJOYMENT AND OVERALL:
I wouldn't call it enjoyable, actually, I'd say you could basically just skip through the episode and watch about a total of 7-10 minutes and get the entire idea, there's a lot of unnecessary dialogue and if you don't care for the romance then there's a lot of nothing going on for the most part. Basically this anime is just teenagers playing house, eating sandwiches, having the occasional battle, and faffing about. The unfortunate part is that the action bits are done really well for the most part.",5
"
                There will be spoilers. ""To escape, players must beat the game by defeating each boss on all 100 floors. However, if they die in the game, they die in real life too."" One of the worst lies in anime history. This anime is like an april fool's joke. This is the anime they should make criminals watch in interrogations.
Story:
This is the cruelest joke any anime producer could pull off. The main character, [insert your name here] , is immune to this ""die in game, die in real life"" concept, even surviving being killed in the game. The storyline his infested with fillers, ecchi, and more.
                  The storyline also has tons of time skips. ""But what about the 100 bosses?"" The final boss decides to make Kirito an offer. Kill him, and he let's everone free. Guess what? The final boss gets defeated! Surprise! This storyline is a trainwreck, adding pointless characters, ecchi, and romance in the series. Then again, the romance and ecchi are for the pervy teens and otakus. Subtracting the fillers and pointless episodes, this anime only has about 6 episodes that are relevant to the storyline. SIX.  I'm not going to even mention the second arc, adding more pointless crap like incest, and downright removing the concept. The storyline proves how rushed this anime really was.
Characters:
Kirito, aka [insert your name.]:
This guy is invincible! He can't be touched, and he gets any girl he sees. He makes the perfect self insert character.!
Asuna: This girl was a boss. However, she went from being a boss, to a cheap tsundere, and eventually, to a straight moe. She is very annoying.
Any other character: They weren't memorable. I don't even remember their names.
Animation and sound:
I didn't mind the animation or soundtrack. They were awesome as a matter of fact, but they were made crap because of this crappy anime. The battles were very rushed however.
Enjoyment: I didn't enjoy this to the least. I saw my life fly away from me after finishing this series. This anime was a joke, a horrifying joke that steals away your time from your life. A troll created this and thought it would be a good joke to play. It wasn't even funny.
Overall:
This crap had a ton of fillers, girls, pointless characters, and time skips that'll make you cry. Take my advice, and stay away. You'll be happy you did.",2
"
                This is my first ever anime review so don't hate if it's not perfect. I find it really funny that none of the reviews for this anime are above 5. People like to hate I guess. I think this is definitely one of the best animes ever made and doesn't deserve all the hate that it gets.
Art: 10
Everything in Sword Art Online is beautifully done. The art is AMAZING. Every scene has amazing backgrounds and the character designs aren't lacking in the least. The battle scenes are so well that it doesn't look choppy or like the producers just wanted to get through the scene.
                  They put just as much effort into each scene to add to our enjoyment.
Sound: 8
OST is amazing and that's it. No need to go in depth because the music fits so well with the show and with each and every scene. Not to mention the OPs and EDs are both amazing.
Story: 9
The part that bugs me the most is when they say that this has a boring plot/story. HOW BLINDED CAN YOU BE? The characters are trapped inside the game of Sword Art Online and if they die in the game, they die in real life. There is no way that this plot point is boring. We follow the male protagonist named Kirito who was in the beta test for the game. He is outcast from everyone else due to that fact and therefore becomes a lone wolf. Each episode of the anime came with suspensions and excitement. You never clearly knew what was going to happen until it happened (unless you read the light novels). I will admit that the second half of the anime became a little bit more predictable but was enjoyable for me nonetheless. 
Characters: 7
The characters in Sword Art Online feel like real people for the most part. They interact with each other like real people and have EMOTIONS. They aren't bland but all there emotions come from their feeling of being frightened because at any moment they could die. They are trapped inside a game where they can't get out and if they die in the game, they have no future. They face this challenge with either bravery or cowardice. The characters are really easy to like and you want to them to beat the game and to head back to the real world. You know that with each coming episode that they may die, giving you the need to attach to each character for the time you see them for you don't know when they will be gone. The romance between the characters is amazing as well. Best since Clannad in my opinion.
Enjoyment: 10
I loved every episode and couldn't wait each week for the next episode to come out. That new episode each week made the top 5 things I need to do each week. 1. Breathe 2. Eat 3. Sleep 4. Watch the next episode of Sword Art Online 5. School. I was deeply saddened when the series came to an end. It was one of the best experiences I have had. I can't wait for a season two. I know they are going to have one because how could the producers leave us now when Sword Art Online is definitely one of the most popular anime to date. 
Overall: 10
This anime is one of my favorites and I doubt there will ever be a fantasy/romance anime that can be better than this. Each episode was an experience for me. It wasn't just another anime to pass my free time. Everything from sound to story made this anime really enjoyable. This show definitely doesn't deserve the hate it gets from reviewers. I recommend this show to everyone I can, especially people who like Romance and Action.",10

                I don't actually care about how much hate I am going to get for this review, so if you don't like my opinion there's a 'not helpful' button you can always click. Please do not try to haunt and kill me if I insult ""the best anime evaaa"".
Story: 3(poor)
First all all let me get one thing straight, as an mmorpg player myself I was really looking forward to seeing this anime as it was two of my favourite things mixed together and I thought that this was awesome.So maybe I went into the anime with my expectations set way too high, but then again it
                  is done by A-1 Pictures, which is the studio that made AnoHana, which I really liked. That aside lets continue with my 'amazing' opinion on this piece of poop. 
For the first 3-5 episodes everything was going great. There was so much potential for this anime to be one of my all-time favourites, but as the story progressed the chance of that happening kept getting lower and lower. First of all I would like to know whether the god of time skips had something to do with the show, because I'm quite sure he did. Like how exactly can you have about 5 out of a 100 supposed boss battles showed. Also why the hell would the last boss be weaker than any of the pervious ones. Moreover the show ignores its premise and genre, and goes on to be a 'romantical comedy' for more than 3/4 of the show.
Which really bugged me.
Art: 6 (fair)
Now, the art for the anime was quite amazing to be honest, but unfortunately I feel like the creators put more effort into the boob-bouncing scenes, rather than the action scenes, which is a shame.
Sound: 7 (good)
Now that is a real waste, because the OST is done by Yuki Kajura, who also did the soundtrack to Fate/Zero, which is my favourite anime.. Not only that but the opening and ending themes (with the exception of one) are similarly done by the same artists who did the Fate/Zero ones which made me really angry as to why the Japanese are wasting such great songs for such a god awful anime.
Character: 2 (dreadful )
Oh gawd, where do I even start.
First of all the main character is as chiched and overpowered a character could possibly get. Such a shame his birthday is the same as mine...
The main female lead changes personality from the baddas mysterious girl she's first presented as to a bitchy damsel in disstress that needs to be protected by the main character as every other heorine out there
The rest of the harem bait don't even deserve an introduction 
Enjoyment: 2 (dreadful)
With all that in mind I didnt really enjoy the anime and finished it only to be able to get a "" I survived"" badge 
Overall: 3 (poor)
Overall this anime is full of crap and it is highly overrated.. despite the very few good things about it I would reccomend you not to watch it if you want your hair on your head and not in your hands as its been pulled out by yourself.
P.S. I shall now proceed to find a good hiding spot before I get killed by all the die-hard fanboys of the show.",3
"
                First, let me state that I watched Sword Art Online for the first time 2 years ago and was one of the fangirls who rated it as a 10. After re-watching it with a critical mindset, I will admit how stupid it was of me to blindly overrate this show back then. SAO is nowhere near as good as it portrays to be, and it’s easy to spot with open eyes.
The idea itself is good. Gamers trapped in a virtual game and cannot escape until someone defeats all 100 levels that increase in difficulty? Okay, sounds good. If you die in the game, you die
                  for real? Sounds even better. Want to throw in a little romance? Go right ahead. Create an overpowered male protagonist and throw countless deus ex machina to make him appear as the ultimate hero with forced happy endings? You just ruined my appetite.
SAO started off well with the introduction of the MCs and a little gameplay to familiarize the viewer with the main objective. There are a couple of fillers that step away from the objective to give side characters their spotlight. It’s not completely irrelevant, because you learn more about the rules of SAO that come in handy later on.
If a show has a survival game, there’s nothing wrong with heroic protagonists (Kirito and Asuna in SAO) as long as it's executed properly. Although it starts off well, SAO fails by throwing illogical excuses to make Kirito appear more heroic than he actually is. Regardless of being a beta tester, there are several cases where he receives special treatment for no reason. A prime example is the addition of a moe deus ex machina character (Yui), who is nothing but a cheat code for Kirito and Asuna to give them an advantage over the other players. Yui is just there to answer questions, give tips, and share info that is not revealed to other gamers. SAO has a bad habit of forcing happy endings with the most ridiculous outcomes, leaving several plotholes. This develops Kirito into an obvious Gary Stu with him unexpectedly doing amazing things every single time he reaches a dead end. There are no logical explanations for his skills and talents that appear out of nowhere. It just happens, along with the first arc’s irrational ending. 
The second part was worse, and I’m not referring to the incest that takes place. Everything restarts with a new game, new rules, new settings, and new characters. Again, the deus ex machina is all over the place, and Kirito would get nowhere without them. There are love triangles involved, and SAO explores one side and leaves the other side unfinished. It’s difficult also to actually feel for the characters when SAO doesn’t give any logical reasons why the person is in love. Asuna reduces from her role as a powerful fighter to a damsel-in-distress. It takes a huge leap by creating this uncomfortable atmosphere, sexualizing the show with these rape scenes, including tentacle rape. 
The romance between Kirito and Asuna was not a bad idea. It was good considering the pacing within two years, so it never led to a cliché and rushed pacing with them immediately falling for each other. Besides Yui, who makes Kirito and Asuna’s story seem like the ultimate romance, things blow way out of proportion when SAO leads into a harem. 
The harem aspect of SAO downgrades the characters significantly, but what can you expect when you have an abundance of female characters and an undefeatable hero? It is hardly ever a moment when you find Kirito spending less than a day with another female without her falling for him, and it throws fanservice in your face every time. Then comes the female characters with their dense moments. All of the scenes with Asuna and other females, who intentionally put themselves in danger, appears constantly as an excuse to bring Kirito into the spotlight as the guy who saves the day. If the girls had a motive or logical reasons for making rash decisions, I would excuse that. But since they just talk badass for an instant and step aside for Kirito to finish what they started, it makes the show unattractive.
There are honestly not any memorable characters in SAO. Kirito and Asuna are super attractive. SAO makes it obvious that they’re every woman/man’s wet dream, and nearly everyone envies them and wants to be like them. However, neither one of them have any special traits. Since they’re your typical Gary Stu and Mary Sue characters, there’s no sense for character development. The villains are not evil at all. They’re both pathetic and laughable, and the 2nd villain is more comical than the first one. Each one of them is indecisive, have no logical motive for their wrongdoings, and lack the common knowledge fit for any evildoer. Although most of the female side characters were just there to fall in love in Kirito, some of the serious ones acted realistically in terms of heartbreak. The gamers varied from good guys and bad guys, so it wasn't completely boring with everyone having their own goals.
The animation and OST are good for the most part. The settings and background design were beautiful, and it realistically portrayed the sunsets with shadows and appropriate color contrasts. The gameplay suited the atmosphere, especially when a character died. The character design and outfits were good. One noticeable problem was how the characters did not suit a situation. For example, two characters are in the same drastic situation, but only one character looks frail and unhealthy while the other looks perfectly normal as if nothing happened.
No complaints with the two OPs and EDs. Personally, I liked the ones from the first arc better. The seiyuu were good also, and most of them reacted well emotionally. The background music fitted the virtual world and different situations. It was playful during the laidback scenes and hardcore during the fight scenes. There were a few times when, immediately after a drastic scene, the music becomes cheerful and made me question whether I’m supposed to take a scene seriously or not.
Overall, it is not hard to notice the bad writing of SAO. The idea was good, but the execution was poor. I had high hopes for it in the beginning, thinking “How can someone possibly dislike this?” Then everything went downhill in a hurry. It led to plotholes. The MCs are basically a lie, because they needed help from deus ex machina and never actually worked for their success. The amazing animation and OST were the best parts, but it cannot make up for SAO’s failure with the story and its characters. Let’s hope SAO II is a bit more decent.",3
"
                Now before I begin this review, let me just say that I have good reason to give this show a one out of ten. It's very rare that I give shows such a bad rating, but hear me out and you'll understand my points. 
Now that we have that taken care of, let's move on.
""Sword Art Online"" takes place in the distant future, where the video-game market has become huge thanks to new technology called, ""NerveGear"". It's a system that fully scans your nerves and all five of your senses and connects them into an online world where practically anything is possible.
The story focuses on
                  the release of the first MMORPG for the NerveGear system, ""Sword Art Online"". Kiriyaga Kazuto (Kirito) is one of the beta-testers for this game and was able to easily get his hands on one of the limited 10,000 copies sold in Japan. When all seems to be going smoothly, things take a ""deadly"" turn when the video-game's creator, Kayaba Akihiko, forces players to keep playing until someone manages to beat the game. In order to do so, players must defeat 100 ""bosses""; each on it's own level in the game and each more powerful than the other. If players die in the game, or someone in the real world attempts to take off the NerveGear, the NerveGear's micro-wave safety system will turn off and it will fry their brain, killing them in real life. 
The first three episodes were absolutely incredible! It completely draws you in to the story, the characters are all so diverse, and the incredible action sequences have you hanging on the edge of your seat! There is so much at stake, and everyone is sacrificing so much to ensure that the game will be beat and everyone gets out alive. The series also grows tense as trust between people grow thin, and players start getting killed by other players. 
Each of the characters was completely unique because they all had their own strengths and weaknesses, forcing everyone to work together in order to survive. One of the most notable side characters is Asuna, an attractive and shy girl who really knows how to wield a sword. She manages to help Kirito defeat the first boss as if they both did it before. I didn't have a doubt that she would be a very strong character that would help Kirito throughout the series.
I also absolutely loved the animation of the show and it's incredible soundtrack! It truly brought the show to life and made me want to hear the music over and over again.
The train started to move really fast, and everything was going fine. That is, until episode four. That's when the series completely ""jumped the shark"" and became what I hoped it would not become; a harem romance series with a worthless male protagonist.
Starting at Episode 4, the series starts to skip a lot of levels, skipping out on a lot of the story and action. And it's starting at Episode 4 when it starts to slowly sink in that Kirito isn't all that much of a nice guy.
Kirito may be strong, but he only cares about himself and becoming the most powerful character in the game. He hides secrets from his allies which lead to their inevitable deaths, he puts the lives of strangers on the line just to get a more powerful sword, and often uses other people as a means to help him grind his way up the rankings. 
What makes this character even more despicable is how many girls are attracted to him and how he treats those girls.
It is a given fact that girls are attracted to strong, independent and cute guys, even if they are completely heartless. Yet once a new female character is introduced into the series, they are only shown for one episode then completely forgotten after the next episode. 
In other words, not only are there far too many side-characters in this series, Kirito doesn't care about a single one of them. Not many people who watch this series notice this, though, and that's why this show is completely over-rated (because a good story doesn't really matter, right? As long as you got great animation, music and a lot of babes, right?)
This anime was definitely rushed. It could have gone on for much longer and included a lot more action sequences. Yet it's as if they cut out all the good parts and left you with what should have been the occasional romance episodes. 
To put this into perspective, imagine cutting out all the action sequences and plot development sections in ""Fairy Tail"" or ""BLEACH"", and all you have is romance episode fillers. That's exactly what this series is.
But that's okay, at least we got Asuna to make the series worth watching, right? 
WRONG! 
By the time the series ends, Asuna goes from being a strong and independent heroin to a damsel-in-distress who can do nothing without Kirito around. The writers completely ruined Asuna's character just to please the large crowd of fanboys, and that's unacceptable! 
And by then end of the series, nothing is explained. 
There is no motive to why the game creator trapped people inside SAO, or how Kirito managed to come back to life after he was killed for a short moment in time only to somehow kill the final boss (which was suppose to be immortal) with ONE STAB. 
I honestly thought that this series was going to be worth watching, yet I regrettably kept watching it hoping to find some good action or character development. Unfortunately, all I found were terrible romance fillers and even more useless side characters. 
AND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND HALF OF SAO, which is when ""Alfheim Online"" gets introduced. It's as if the writers made the second-half of the series just to please the fan-boys and further throw SAO's potential out the window. It really would have been best to have just stopped SAO as soon as the game was beat, yet they decided to keep the bandwagon going and make the second half. 
This section of the anime is even hated by the most die-hard SAO fans for a reason; the suspense and action from the first part simply isn't there anymore. The second-half just throws cute girls in your face and the series becomes extremely awkward and annoying, especially once Kirito's sister gets introduced (and if you've watched enough anime, then you know where this is going). 
If I were to compare this show to another television show, it would definitely be the series LOST. It started off with incredible potential, then it just went downhill and never came back up. 
In conclusion, ""Sword Art Online"" had incredible potential as an action series, and the first three episodes proved that. Yet it ended up to be another version of ""School Days""; pathetic love story, hardly any plot, despicable lead and a lot of cute girls to keep the targeted audience interested.
I honestly despise this anime with all my heart, despite what the large crowd of fan boys have to say. Not just because of the terrible character development and the worthless plot, but what this series could have become. It could have been an incredible action series if they did it right, but they flushed it's incredible potential down the toilet and replaced it with video-game boy fan service! 
This is why I believe that Sword Art Online is not only one of the most over-rated anime's in existence, but one of the biggest wastes of incredible potential in history.
THE VERDICT:
+ Excellent Music/Action Sequences
+ Colorful Animation
- Worthless Plot
- Incredible Potential Wasted
- Terrible Character Development
- Despicable Lead
- Pointless Second Part (Alfheim Online)
- Harem Replaces Action
- Too Many Girls
SCORE: 1/10
DO NOT WATCH!",1

                I wonder if it's possible to write an uncontroversial review on this anime. Let me take a crack at it. 
*****
You know, SAO is not the worst thing the anime industry has ever churned out, despite what people out there say. Is it bad? Sure. The characters suck and the plot is full of conveniences and the pacing is pretty crappy and there is no thematic value and blah blah blah. 
SAO is such an easy target. It's not just because it's a bad anime; it's because it's a bad anime with massive hype. Compounding matters is the perception that people have of SAO's fanbase
                  - I mean, when terms like ""wish-fulfillment"" get thrown around on a near-constant basis, it's hard to avoid imagining thousands of lonely and immature otaku hovering behind their laptop screens, ready to jerk it as soon as Asuna appears with a sandwich for Kirito.
If we treat anime as a medium for storytelling, and if we then judge SAO on its storytelling ability, yeah, it sucks. It's not really possible to defend its narrative structure nor its execution. Kirito is one of the most painfully dull characters in existence. I figure that Asuna was only created because the author of the source LNs had a bet to see how quickly he could torpedo a character's development. They even managed to slip in some incest in there - oh, but wait, she's not *really* his sister, so clever. This anime is fraught with a litany of serious issues and it deserves to be called a bad anime.
But you know what? Despite all that, it's still not offensively atrocious. SAO has great production values, and the fights are well-animated. The setting is fleshed out just enough to qualify as immersive, and while the game mechanics are absurd and serve as little more than deus ex machina, a lack of fidelity towards real-life MMORPGs isn't the biggest crime in the world considering that some of the most highly regarded anime out there take massive liberties with their internal logic as well (looking at you, M- nah...probably not a good idea to name names). And, well, I managed to get a laugh out of all the ridiculous plot armor that Kirito stacks himself with, and Asuna's almost surreal transformation from badass heroine to helpless fap bait had me in stitches. So there's that, I guess.
I think SAO gets way too much hate for what it really is. It's a bad anime that got too much hype, but it's really not the worst thing ever. There's much, much worse out there than this. SAO didn't give me a venereal disease, it didn't kill my brain cells (well maybe a few), it didn't make me want to stop watching anime forever, it didn't make me contemplate suicide, and it didn't make me want to write a hate review. It's just an unremarkably bad anime. That's all. 4/10.",4

                Watching Sword Art Online (SAO) is kind of like watching a baby bird learning how to fly. At first is stumbles a bit, but then gets the hang of it and takes off. However, once it's in the air, one of two things can happen: it's able to keep its strength and fly safely, or comes crashing down as its unable to hold its own. SAO, in my opinion, is like the latter of these two situations. After getting going a few episodes in, it got really good, then halfway through everything changed and it fell apart. From what I'm gathering, there appears to be
                  a fairly large difference in opinion on the show itself, some love it and some hate it. Personally, I loved it but that's from a mostly enjoyment standpoint. When you look deeper into the show, the flaws are pretty obvious.
So, lets get on to the breakdown!
Story - 4/10
I was very torn on how to rate the story of this show. The overall concept behind it, a virtual reality MMORPG was amazing to me. It's something I've thought about for years. However, it feels like something was lost when they translated this idea into a show. At first, things are too fast-paced, events move faster than I was comfortable with. But a few episodes in it was wonderful. The original action-based plan of the anime turned into a smooth more romance based one with action. The concept of losing your life in reality if you die in the game added a nice touch of suspense and drama to the whole story, though this only applied to the first half. There was a ten episode stretch where this show probably would have ranked a solid 8 or 9. Once the first arc ended, however, it just collapsed.
The second half of the season, which I honestly thought was a spin-off show at first, was a game changer and greatly took away from the quality of the show. If you're content with the story at the end of the first half, feel free to stop there. The aforementioned romance aspect took over and the show fell into the dark cast-iron mold of romance anime. Unnecessary aspects, such as ideas of incest, were also tossed in. The previous idea of dying in the game means death in life disappeared, removing a major piece of drama that could have been better utilized. The focus on romance took over the show and seems to have taken away from other story aspects - everything revolved around a single girl far more than what seemed appropriate for the show.
Overall, the story pans out to be about 4/10 (""decent"") to me.
Art - 10/10
In contrast to the violently fluctuating story quality, the visual aspect of SAO was incredible. As to be expected from an anime produced in 2012, the artwork is crisp, clean, and smooth. The character designs are highly appealing and the landscapes portrayed within the story are beautiful. Based in virtual reality, any scene was possible and the ones shown were highly detailed.
Sounds - 8/10
Audio was appropriate in most situations but nothing made it stand out from any other show. I did greatly enjoy both openings, Crossing Fields and Innocence, though.
Character - 3/10
To me, this was the most problematic part of SAO. Due to the pacing issues, some characters initially introduced magically vanished for many episodes while others disappeared shortly after being introduced. With the concept of losing your in place for the first arc, you would expect many emotional moments to be possible, and they were presented. However, failure to develop character backgrounds and personalities allowed emotional moments to fall through. I'm generally a very emotional person so I can be swayed by these scenes pretty easily, yet they only managed to make me tear where I imagined I would be fully crying.
The massive amount of characters thrown in with off-paced story-telling just leads to disaster. Even the two main characters suffered from stunted character development and left me quite disappointed. Additionally, the final villain just feels utterly out of place and awkward to me. All this said, there still manages to be ""enough"" character development to allow the show to work but still only gets a 3/10 (""poor"")
Enjoyment - 8/10
Despite the major issues in the story and sub-par character development, SAO manages to be a very entertaining show. At first, I somehow completely overlooked these flaws and fully enjoyed SAO at a basic level. It wasn't until I looked back on it that I realized how flawed it was. This is likely where the split in opinions stems from (once again, my opinion). If you're looking for something to just pass time and enjoy a show without any deep meanings, SAO fits the bill. However, if you're looking for a solid storyline with characters you can fall for, you probably want to look somewhere else.
Overall - 6.6/10 (6)
SAO was generally worth the watch and I did enjoy it. The artwork and sound are really holding this rating up (though I deducted a bit to give a 6). It's a show that had massive potential to be something amazing and fell flat on its face.
I took a bit of thought and self-coaxing to actually criticize this show since I enjoyed it quite a bit. Hopefully the time I spent mulling this over and analyzing was worth and you all find this review useful. Thanks for reading!",6
"
                When I first read about this story, I was so excited to finally see something so original. However I was greatly disappointed after watching the first two episodes. The storyline is quite fresh enough to grab my attention, but was poorly executed in the telling. The first episode fails miserably as it plainly introduces your typical boring protagonist: a lonely but talented gamer who has already played the beta version so has the upper hand in the game. Then another yet so boring character is introduced and the two gamers abruptly build a relationship that is short lasted. The characters seem like they have no
                  personality and each one is no different from the rest basically each character has little to no dialogue. The point of the story is quickly announced by the game master as if the audience wasn't smart enough to figure it all out themselves. There isn't much action save for a couple of sword slashes that ends each fight. What burns the series even more is the lack of seriousness the characters seem to have. If death in the game will also result in death in reality, how come the gamers seem to have little to no care for their lives. When the first gamer is killed in a fight, everyone else seems to brush it off as if the gamer can be resurrected. How will the audience take the story seriously if the characters don't? Overall the story seems interesting enough for me to continue watching, just hope it improves.",4
"
                Ok... Finally finished SAO, and this is an edited review.
Before I start this, people there will probably be many who may disagree, but also agree, but before that, I just got to say that this anime is probably one of the most spectacular anime I have seen in many months, or even year. Aside from that, there are people who hate this anime for whatever their reasons are, and those who love it and think this is a masterpiece. 
I believe that most people considered this an amazing anime, i wondered why at first but ever since i started the first episode, i just couldn't
                  stop until the latest episodes that had aired. (the anime club i'm in decided to watch this anime) i basically though this was like .Hack, but it was much better in every quality aspect (my opinion, you have the right to disagree.) everyone who likes games and Is an otaku Should, or maybe Need to watch this. Now what I'm going to review and write is my own opinion so... you know... :3
Story: 10
Even though i say this, i don't COMPLETELY think that it's the best in the world. In fact, I think that some part of the story of SAO is moving very fast, or even abrupt. The main reason why I said this (my grading) is because of my personal favorite genre. Adding action, game, romance, adventure, some  fantasy, but I kinda believe that someday in the future it maybe possible, and only Some slice of life to it. The timing is just right also. Instead of making us sit there and wasted like 30 eps so the main character could lv up, they just skip the little things and go to the main things, which keeps viewers, like me, excited and mostly on the climax. SAO is pretty easy to follow. It's not some sort of complex anime, like Durarara where you skip back and forth between the present and the past, and not really anything to think about, so the viewers who dislike using brain power probably will like this. So yea... that's why I rated SAO as 10 for the story. Not much side tracks so you should be able to enjoy it much much more than many others. I actually thought at first that SAO would probably be like other typical anime where it will get boring sooner or later as you continued to watch, but it's, in my opinion, the complete opposite. The genres, however, did slightly change. If I'm not mistaken on this one, I would say that the first arc had a slightly more action than the second arc, but the second have more romance and tears of joy instead of tears of depression and sadness. 
Art: 9
Yea.... will people these days are pretty good, and better than in the past. They got more Waaalaaa to the art now, so i don't really think there's anything to say. One thing that really stands out are the emotion that the characters are giving in the anime. The face clearly expressed the situation and the motive they have. It has feeling that could be expressed without words, and that, for me, is really impressive. The movement, the face, the shadows etc. really fit in and there's pretty much nothing to complain about. I could be wrong, since the story pulls me in, and I don't have that much energy to pay attention much to the art. I gave SAO's art a 9 instead of a 10 is because sometime, I feel as if the characters expression are sometime over done, and can be seen with a little too much emotions. Just my opinion of course.
Sound: 10
I especially like this anime because the sounds are great to listen to, and it feels smooth, reeling me in more to the anime. The background fits in to the environment nicely, surrounding SAO and makes this anime more realistic and natural. What excites me the most is how they used the sounds, making the anime sounds much like you're watching a game, or better yet, making you feel as if you Are in it. 
Character: 10
The characters are very nice. Not boring, not annoying or anything that just makes you wanna smash whatever is in front of your eye on to the little PC or device you're watching from. I experienced it before. Not sure if anyone of you guys have, but anyway... Since I now have completed SAO, I can see that the characters are the same whether they are in the game or in reality, and what that mean is, if Kirito is perfect then, he will always be perfect now, although that's a debatable matter. Romance anime have the type of crying that I would say are annoying, phony, and irritating to my ears. For SAO, I could really grab on to them and kind of interact with it, as in, the reasons of why they are crying the way they do or take hold of the situation and imagine f I was in their place, which really matches on how I would feel. This of course is based on who you are, and your personality. Those who just love seeing their friends, or just anyone close to they suffer or die would definitely disagree with me on this one. Romance anime usually have people crying about useless things, but SAO made a lot of senses in the timing of when the character should be happy, sad, angry, or derpy.
Enjoyment: 10
Nothing to say here, since I mostly put the enjoyment rating the same as the story. It's good to have something to enjoy, and I've been waiting so long for these kind of anime to come out. Although this anime has the time in the story where you Cannot help but tightens your fist as hard as you can, since the scene are unbearable to watch. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I""M TALKING ABOUT. HOW DARE HE TOUCH, AND SNIFF ON HER EXCELLENCY?! 
Overall: 10
I'm sure that not everyone will agree with me here, but at least everyone could agree with Some thing I typed down. I personally think that SAO is very emotional from the beginning to the end, and that is really just what I think. I've seen many who does not seem think that way. Well then... I would gladly say that this is one of my favorite anime. Of course there are others which I seem to enjoyed as equivalent as SAO. I hope this help anyone who are planing to watch this someday.",10
"
                As an average traveller of the internet, I have been bombarded with millions of images regarding this anime, most of them filled with fanboys/girls saying how amazing Sword Art Online was, and how Asuna and Kirito were the most perfect couple in history. Curious, I decided to waste 20 minutes on watching the first episode, and I do admit, it looked really fantastic. It did of course, it doesn't anymore... 
Story: 3/10
I don't really know how the creator of SAO handed his work to his editor. I figured he gave him a piece of paper with ""CLICHE!"" written on the middle, I might be wrong.
As
                  gamers might be aware of, reaching the final boss of any MMO is a tough job, you need to train a lot, get the best equipment and skilled companions to aid you. Considering the fact that the very first boss of SAO (the weakest) was incredibly hard to handle, you could picture the amount of work our ""heroes"" will have to reach the end... pretty much none. Every episode occurs around 3 to 6 months after the previous one, in a desperate attempt to make the story move forward, I don't really see why, especially when the first episodes are nothing but useless fillers. I could write a novel with the flaws of this poorly made excuse for a story, but the other reviews do a good job on it.
Art: 7/10
Being of 2012, the animation is quite good, doing all those flashy sparkles and carefully designed background is not an easy task. But still, it's not really impressive, because most new animes have the same detail and definition, so it doesn't really stand out that much.
Sound: 6/10
Like the art, good. I can't really say much, because I rarely pay attention to background music, unless it is really amazing.
Character: 3/10
Kirito is a Mary Sue, that reason alone is more than enough to make me hate him. ""This boss is way too strong to defeat alone!"" Kirito does it. ""We need to work together to survive!"" Kirito survives alone. ""You can only wield one sword!"" Kirito gets two of them, and the list continues. Despite being a boring, anti-social, party-pooper son of a goat, he manages to make every single girl in the series to fall for him with no effort. The same goes for his experience and skill, you would expect the other characters to be also experienced, and they kinda are, but our ""hero"" is always stronger than everyone by 700 miles!
Now, the girl... Asuna started of as a completely mysterious person, some time-skips later, she was the strong, independent and ruthless captain of the strongest guild in the game! Some time-skips later, she was the very cute and innocent, dinner-preparing house wife... for our ""hero"" of course! I enjoy character development, but this young lady is doing it wrong... I can't really say many things, unlike the other girls, she is not very fond of Kirito, but like ALL the other girls, she falls for him and actually marries him. You don't see the love, you don't see the process, they spend some time together, next thing you see she's undressing for him... But don't panic, the secondary characters are actually kind of nice, you might like them, too bad 90% of the time is dedicated to the ""perfect couple""...
Enjoyment: 4/10
Other than an occasional joke over here and there and the rare appearance of some secondary characters, there's not much to enjoy. You can still watch it for the pretty colors.
Disappointing, overrated, lame in general... Don't bother to watch this. The feeling is similar to ""Two girls One cup"". You start with something good, but in the end you get sh*t, except not literally this time...",4

                To start this off, I first have to preface that I can not, for the life of me fathom why this show got as popular, as it has been getting. It has become quite trendy to jump on the hate train for this show however, so I will not dwell on the fact, that I simply have a passionate hate for this show, which is actually very rare for me. 
I am not even trying to be witty when saying, that this show misses pretty much every single aspect of telling a good or even mediocre story. What comes around at the end is simply
                  and nonchalantly put, a mess. Quite an intriguing mess to say the least but only for the fact, that this existing has rendered me speechless for quite some time now. 
I won't cover basic review sections as extensively as other people did, because I would probably just parrot them. Animation is good, characters are unfocused blobs of fodder, main character is sued up to the point of ridiculousness, Asuna is the one even passable feature of the anime but is frequently shoved aside for Kirito to shine, ans so on basically. Do not pay as much attention to the score on this one, because it does not really reflect my enjoyment of the show. There is definitively no score for that. 
What I rather want to do however, is to try an understand how such a story could even be published to that extend and in such a state of unfocused and unpolished dribble. I have not figured this out even to this day and it still baffles me. What we first have to understand however is, that this is a story for 14-year-olds and below. In my opinion only those people could have a legitimate good time with it and show future potential of at least grasping the basics of a good story. Shounen is the most successful form of anime for a reason and those frequent tropes found in cette genre are there for a reason also. But still, shows like AoT, which I don't particularly like but could still see the appeal in, when threatened to get shot, at least have parts that redeem the show as something not being worth your interest rather than making you hate it. But there is no redeeming with SAO though. There is only agony and despair.
But I don't want to insult anybody, despite what I said earlier. I do try very hard not to.  So let us rejoice in the fact that at least there are not more episodes coming and I don't want to hear about gun gale or whatever. He is a girl now and I don't care. 
But what makes this show so bad, so abysmal besides the obvious things like unnecessary timeskips, nonsensical charaktermoments and -motivations, literally cheating death because we'd like to keep out protagonist as flawless as possible?
Well, in my opinion, what is far worse than any of these things is simply a lack of knowing even the basics of writing on the authors side. It is like Twilight all over again with these people. Aside from the baffling decisions that went into structuring the plot of Swort Art ans Alfheim Online, which are both almost equally bad in my opinion, this whole anime does not show even the slightest form of restraint. An overhyped, ultra badass, untouchable, walking deus ex machina of a protagonist is just the tip of the iceberg in this case. 
It is as if a kid without any kind of experience in the field of writing just walked into an office some day and somehow pressed everybody there into publishing his story. This makes not even passable first writing steps for a teenager. This seems almost like an insult to regular anime watchers, even consumers of shounen. I see Naruto writing itself deeper into a corner with every chapter, I see Bleach, refusing to bloody end but I have never seen such an embarrassment of a story. A community praising it as the second coming just adds further layers of salt to this already bad tasting meal. 
So in conclusion, I would not recommend this show to anybody wanting at least a decent story. Something passable this is not. This is bad, appallingly bad, horrifyingly bad. So yeah, terrible show, awful in almost every regard, two years worth of semen, goodbye dear reader. 
Animation was fairly nice though.",2

                This is my first time writing one of these, so here I go. I only watched this to see what all the hype was about, and, I have to say this is overrated, in my opinion. I think most people like this anime for the romance aspect, so, they tend to overlook everything else. Anyway, I really think SAO is boring; yeah, the plot is okay, but they aren't doing a good job of executing it. The characters aren't interesting at all and I really don't have any enjoyment while watching it. But, I'll keep watching to see if it gets better, I guess.

                Getting sucked into an Online MMORPG, having adventures with your life on the line each day, meeting new people and having an excuse to escape real life while building up a romance in it with a beautiful girl and being the strongest amongst everyone. Sounds like the wish every puberty ridden and anime-/videogames loving teenager has. It's no use explaining how Sword Art Online features all of this since 90% of you have already seen it anyway or at least have heard of it in one way or another. While most of the otaku-community probably wetted their beds in excitement for this show I gave
                  it a little while and quite a bit after it ended I decided to give it a try and be all neutral and leave aside all the prejudices I had from such an immensely popular anime being built up on all of this mentioned above. I'm not really a sucker for ""fan fiction""-like premises like this one but to swim with the trend and to fill up my list of rather longer titles I ended up watching the whole thing in roughly a week.  
Unfortunately most of my prejudices have come true. But let's get on to this step by step. 
Be aware that in order to justify my problems I had with the show and especially its story this review WILL INCLUDE MAJOR SPOILERS. In case you have not finished Sword Art Online yet or haven't even started watching this is your last chance to head back. Just head for the 100% spoiler free verdict on the bottom of the review.
So the story is focused around our main protagonist and totally original ""Kirito"" (or Kirigaya in real life) who is participating in the new and very first VRMMORPG. After a day of trying out the game and getting to meet a guy with the remarkable German name ""Klein"" he spends the day getting him and himself used to the mechanics and talking to each other. As they want to log out they find out their ""log-out""-buttons are gone from the interface and that there is no way of disconnecting from Sword Art Online. At the end of the first episode the game master appears and tells them that they have to reach the end of the game and defeat the last boss in order to be released and that many people who tried to remove the so called ""NerveGear"", which is an external piece of hardware to get yourself into the game world, have died in the process. Their only chance is to beat the game. 
While the first episode was really well done and set an interesting tone for what may come next I was surprised it was the opposite of what I expected. At first!
Let's get on to what Sword Art Online does right story wise in a short manner without digging deeper into synopsis. Basically besides the first few episodes and the first one in particular, nothing. I can literally not think of anything that has been achieved well story wise. Let me explain!
After the first episode they constantly use time skips to probably skip the time Kirito obviously must have used to become the strongest player in the whole game. He is a walking Deus Ex Machina with an asshole as wide as the moon considering all the stuff the pulls out of his cheeks. Without explaining he is just the strongest because he ""played the beta"" before. This is the only explanation we get and that he is some sort of hybrid of a ""cheater"" and ""beta-player""; a ""beater"". Breaking the game rules like that can only be considered cheating though because he is the only player being able to dual-wield. How does this work? Thanks to clever writing? Most likely not. But Kirito is not the only problem. It's basically the whole game world which is not only generic as hell but also not explained in how it works at all. There is an orphanage in one scene with the caretaker and children acting like real people. Are those NPCs or real players? If they are NPCs, why even care for them? If they are real people, how can 20 ten year old kids end up in a game like SAO which is obviously intended for mature audiences considering there is an undressing and an implied sex option implemented. This whole thing feels so lazy and watching it made me feel sick because those failures are so obvious.
Same goes for the feature to ""revive dead players"". Excuse me? I thought people are going to die if they are killed in SAO. How can you revive them? Maybe the game gives the players enough time before their brains get toasted by microwaves implemented into the NerveGear. This would have been more plausible but it wasn't explained at all. Such a feature also comes with heavily forced drama and bad character development as well! In one episode we get to know a new character whose turn is it now to have his amount of screen time with badass Kirito - this character is of course female since all the ladies fall for the Black Swordsman, just as the target audience would love as well! So we have this new character on the screen and barely got to know her and in the same episode she dies. And Kirito cries. Boohoo. The whole relationship obviously happened off-screen for Kirito but the audience has been totally unaffected of this connection between Kirito and random-kawaii-replaceable-moeface #54. The same with any other relationships with every other useless girl who could be part of Kirito's harem. But no, they get dumped a few episodes later. Not even the relationship between Kirito and the main female lead Azuna has been given a realistic and believable approach. This is not even forgivable since Azuna is what drives Kirito later on and is what saves Kirito later on.
Things get even worse when they introduce Yui. A sweet and innocent loli with no memories calling Kirito and Azuna her parents. It is later revealed she is a program written by the game master to stay in charge of the trapped people’s mood and prevent them from doing bad things such as suicide. But when the game master got like ""I'll kill you all if you don't beat me"" she was prohibited from interfering with people. And since computer programs obviously have emotions she also got dragged down by witnessing people taking their own lives and the audience was meant to feel sooo bad for her. But I couldn't because this thing felt so damn forced with her sacrificing herself and all this in the end and being a mere plot device and full of conveniences just to end the series. Most of her actions haven't been described at all. It was just happening out of the blue. 
And all this isn't even due to the episode count because the second half of the series ""Sword Art Online"" has not been given attention to the name giving video game, no! It was another video game called ""Alfheim Online"". The ""ALO"" arc features all your self-insert needs as well! A badass unbeatable ass pulling male lead, lolis, fairies and.... Incest! But before the ALO arc we have the ending to the Sword Art Online-one which is just terrible to say the least. The main villain as interesting as he may have sounded turned out to be a one-dimensional one at best. His motives haven't been explained the least and he even forgot why he did all this. I'm not kidding. He just forgot. Also the last boss was defeated with ""the power of love and friendship and the shounen-force of never giving up"".
And now it is up for Alfheim Online because what do we do right after leaving a game after multiple years being hospitalized and having lost around 10 kg looking like a walking dead man while Azuna stayed completely healthy looking? Yes, video games, also VRMMORPGs of course. Also introduced with the new arc is a new villain who is just as flat and plain as the one before just that he just seems to have a rape fetish for teenagers which happen to be the male lead's love interest. Of course he is also the main villain in the game itself who somehow has the ability to make the players feel pain again. It sure was a smart move to not put restrictions on this.
The second arc also includes tentacle rape and various attempts of what seems like rape. Really going for it all, aren't you, SAO?
ALO ends with yet even more plot holes. Yui is just hacking all the way through even when clearly not being part of the game anymore at all. She even was just a minor part of the first game as well not having had any access to vital functions which could change the game rules. Kirito also uses the power of friendship and love again to overcome being pinned down and even having an inner monologue with the dead game master of SAO who somehow given him the information to log into the game and rewrite it so that our evil super villain loses all his strength and even manage to give himself the best sword of the game to finish him off one final time.
SPOILER-FREE-ZONE! READING PAST HERE IS SAVE!
Long story short; the story of SAO is absolutely dreadful. And even the most vital part which was the sense of danger and the feeling that something is at stake which was the case during the SAO arc was completely gone during ALO. It took itself so serious then it was downright laughable.
In terms of art and sound SAO delivers an above average performance. The character designs may not be the most innovative of them all but the backgrounds are pretty, the colors being used offer variety and the interface and HUD were being integrated nicely without being used too much or bothering the visual experience. Yuki Kajiura who is mostly known for her outstanding works in Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero has composed the series soundtrack hence why the music is the best this show has to offer besides the escapism for various individuals. The opening theme was also quite beautiful and the voice actors delivered a more than solid performance while doing their job.
Besides the story the obviously weakest part are the characters. Too little time was used on actually developing them and making us care about them and way too much time was spend on building off-screen relationships the audience could not relate too. Besides the mostly annoying side cast all we have are generic lead characters with a lack of depth. 
In conclusion Sword Art Online was not something I would recommend. For anyone who wants to watch a show for good characters, writing and world-building Sword Art Online will not be to their likings. If all you want to do is being entertained by obvious flaws and lackluster setting and characters, go ahead. This show might just be exactly your thing.",3

                Okay here's the thing I should have written this review a while ago just been to busy anyways 
Sword art online Review can now Begin.
Well it does have a very interesting premise but is ultimately wasted with the garbage that the producers brought to the table and as much as I would love to hate on sword art online I will not because lets be honest it's been hated on long enough anyways.
story (3) the story is just plain bad with ass pulls all over the place and just gigantic time skips that makes you left wondering what just happened and I had to just
                  shake my head  a lot of the time wondering if the producers were even thinking because Asuna is totally butchered as a character her development was just awful she's bad ass female warrior one minute and fairy tale princess the next it just makes me sad that they did that to her sigh anyways the 2 half of this show was a nightmare on elm street no kidding it left me horrified to this day I don't know what I watched Kirito everything he did was an ass pull I mean for crying out loud.
Art (7) well this is one of the only redeeming qualities this show had the Art was good and some scenes were just breath taking though it could have been better.
Sound (10) Amazing music just sad that it was used for a show like this the most sad thing is that this music is so amazing that it actually made me cry a few times but no not for the show just for the music.
Characters (2) the most disgusting and worst part of this series are the characters Asuna as I already stated had a lot of potential but utterly was treated like garbage in the end so and Kirito ass pull could't do anything that made remotely any sense whatsoever and Yui no words can describe the amount of hatred I have for that girl papa mama ugh.
Overall (3) now I could sit here and say this was the most horrible show I have ever watched but I can't because it isn't I have seen way worse trust me but it was bad just wow.
Enjoyment (1) how could I enjoy an Anime that made me feeling gulity for even starting it ?
Just stay away from this show if you are looking for a realistic story with actual reasoning characters other wise you will just feel bad at the end of this.",3
"
                I can see why so many people hate this anime. In fact, I sometimes wonder why I even liked it so much. After giving it some thought, I've come to a conclusion. SAO haters, let me explain to you guys why so many (including me) liked this BLATANTLY BAD anime.
As I look back on SAO, the story was pretty bad. The one dimensional main character shits on everyone. A harem was built in two episodes to be left without further development for the entire series. The main girl, a fierce-tsundere-turned-helpless-princess has no development either, apart from being raped a couple times. WHY did i like
                  this then? WHY are there so many SAO fanboys (like me) who give this anime endless, seemingly undeserved praise?
Look at it from our perspective. Most of us are gamers, bad at socializing, so we isolate ourselves in our gaming/anime worlds. Without girlfriends.
THen comes along Kirito, who perfectly fits in our mold: gamers, bad with people, without girlfriends. And this guy-- hes a badass. He shits on everyone, his dick is a vagina-magnet, and he defies the admins because hes a badass, and thats just how it works.
Asuna is the seemingly perfect girlfriend. THough she has ZERO character development, she: 1. is hot 2. is an awesome gamer too who 3. also needs saving like a damsel in distress and 4. MAKES KIRITO SANDWICHES. Come on, every guy wants a girlfriend who he can say ""make me a sandwich"" to. So while to you, cultured anime watchers who can see through these 4 points, Asuna is a walking pile of cliches, to us fanboys she is PERFECT. SHE MAKES SANDWICHES. PERFECT.
So, back to my point: SAO is a people pleaser. Though it has good art and sound, it has a bad storyline, bad characters, too many cliches. But it's still a people pleaser. And it pleases lots of people (like me). We are nerds who don't know any better and fall into the role of Kirito--who, due to his one- dimensional nature, anyone can fit as. We fall in love with the pile of cliches, we enjoy our undeveloped harem, and we watch as Kirito shits on everyone. And in the end, we enjoy the anime, worship it on forums, argue with the haters... etc.
Ultimately, SAO is a blatant people pleaser. As an anime noob, I fell for it, like the other fanboys, i enjoyed it, and it became one of my favorites. The more experienced anime watchers saw the cliches, wondered ""why the fuck do these people worship SAO???"", posted their valid opinions, and were labeled the ""haters"". Here lies the controversy in Sword art Online.",10

                Sword Art Online:
(This is my first review using a new rating system. If you want to see how this system works, check out 'about me' in my profile. Enjoy!)
Sword Art Online is a gamer's dream come true. Sweeping the masses by storm last year, SAO has quickly become one of the most popular anime in recent years. This is probably due to the fact that many anime enthusiasts also happen to be gamers. However, this show has just as many haters as fanboys, so does this show meet up to the hype? For me, as guilty as I may feel saying it, it's a definitive
                  yes.
Story 7/10:
Sword Art Online is about a gamer named Kirito who, along with thousands of other gamers, gets trapped in a virtual reality mmo. To go along with this, if you die in the game, you die in real life. The only way to get out of the game, is to beat all 100 floors of the game, a task that could take years to achieve. Like I said, the concept of this show is tailor made for gamers, and much of the language used is suited for those accustomed to gaming language. With these thoughts in mind, I was hyped to start this anime. However, the first 4 episodes of this show are very poor. The pacing is horrendous, and I strongly considered dropping it during these episodes. After these are out of the way though, the story blooms into something much greater. Basically once Kirito starts spending more time with Asuna, the show starts to become more focused. A split focus between the romance between these characters, and the ultimate goal of beating the game. From episode 4 to 15, the show completely had me under its spell and got me completely hooked. These episodes also really dove into the physiological standpoint of how being trapped in this world for years can effect you. After these episodes, the focus of the show completely shifts. Not that this shift was bad, in fact I really loved the latter half of the series, however, I can see many people being disappointed in the shift the show takes. The concept for this show's plot was fantastic, and besides the first 4 episodes, I loved its execution as well. Admittedly, yes, there are plenty of plotholes, completely blatant flaws in some logic, and the explanation for many key events can be awful at times. Things like this don't really bother me personally, but I know for many people it ruined the show for them, so if that kind of thing gets to you: beware. It definitely wasn't perfect, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story, more than I probably should have. I leave the story with a very good 7/10 because even though there were flaws everywhere, they mostly didnt bother me and the story was great in MY opinion. However, I can completely understand someone giving the story aspect of this show a score MUCH worse.
Art 9/10:
The animation, worlds, and characters are all beautifully on display in this anime. The settings of this show are widely varied and beautiful, excellently presenting an mmo-style world in anime form. This was a world that I honestly wanted to be in. What really made the art from this show a masterpiece were the battle scenes. The fights were fluid, and gorgeous. A vast array of battle animations and actions were on display, and the big boss battles were utterly enticing. I really haven't seen an anime before with such an expansive world, and such beautiful action animations.
Sound 8/10:
As far as music goes, Sword Art Online had a great overall OST. The opening ""Crossing Field"" is personally one of my favorite opening songs in history and is catchy as hell. The music during the scenes all fit the scenes very well, and were definitely more memorable than most soundtracks that I've heard. The voice acting for the show was good as well, although I'm no expert in the world of Japanese voice acting, and 9 times out of 10 pick the dub over the sub when available. It's gotta be a plus though when I can emotionally attach to characters when I don't even understand what they are saying without reading subs.
Characters 7/10:
Kirito is what every mmo player secretly wishes they were. A black wearing swordsman who absolutely overpowers everyone he faces. Include that he ""unintentionally"" gets every girl he meets to fall in love with him, and he is the perfect image of what gamers wish they were. This is a slight problem though, because his lack of flaws can make him seem a little one dimensional. For me, it wasn't a huge problem though because like I said, he is an ideal character, which is a joy to watch. It's true that the characters do lack development, some even seemingly regressing instead of progressing. Kirito seems to run in circles with his development, and Asuna does anything but develop. However, the real strength in the characters is the relationship between Kirito, Asuna, and another character that I will avoid due to spoilers. The relationship between these 2 was very stereotypical of a romance on the surface, but for some reason I found myself REALLY caring about it, and hoping that everything would end up happy for them. Unlike the individual characters, the relationship they had DID develop, and was touching to watch. I guess what made these 2 seemingly flawed main characters stand out, is just the fact that they were very likable. They aren't characters that you can really say you hate, you may shake your head or laugh at some of the things they do, but you can see that their intentions are clearly in the right direction. So even thought they really lacked development and in Kirito's case were overpowered, they were still very likable. The side characters were another story though. They seemed to have little to no purpose, popping in and out of the show at random moments. Some got no more than 1 episode of screen time. This made the side characters very insignificant, even though the weren't necessarily bad characters. All in all, there are definitely a few shining characters, but many of the side ones hold this category back from being anything better than ""good.""
Enjoyment 9/10:
I enjoyed the $#!+ out of this show. Admittedly, I really didn't care for the first 4 episodes. I even told a friend ""If this show was half as good as its opening song, then I would love it."" But after powering through these episodes, I slowly started to change my perspective, and ending up loving this show. The whole concept was brilliant, and the way they dive into the psychological and moral aspects of the characters trapped in this world is great. Between the battle scenes, plot twists, romance, and gaming references, this show was ridiculously enjoyable to watch.
Recommendation:
I can't say for sure you will love this show due to the divided audience, but I definitely recommend you give it a chance because you might like it as much as, or even more than me.
Stream it! +.1
Overall 8.1/10
Sword Art Online was a true joy to watch. With a brilliant concept, the show for the most part delivers wonderfully. Although the first 4 episodes weren't the best, the show picks itself up and delivers quite the adventure. The hype surrounding this show is well deserved, and I can't imagine someone who plays any sort of rpg to dislike this show. It absolutely has its flaws and inconsistencies, but I was able to look past them and can confidently say that Sword Art Online was a great show to watch.
The Verdict:
Fantastic concept that for the most part delivers. A wide array of appeal, but especially for those who enjoy the fantasy genre and gaming.
Pros:
+ Fantastic concept
+ Knows its audience (gamers)
+ Touching character relationships
+ World and animations are beautiful
+ OP is one of my favorites
Cons:
- Less than stellar first 4 episodes
- Plenty of plot holes/poor explanation
- Lack of character development
- Drastic plot change could definitely disappoint some people
If you liked Sword Art Online, then watch....
Fate/Zero:
Mainly because they are both action oriented and the main characters are sword wielders, I also needed an excuse to recommend Fate/Zero lol.
Accel World:
Most people who have liked SAO like Accel World as far as I know. Both are themed around virtual reality games, and both are set in the same universe.
8.1/10 - Great",8

                If you're a person who doesn't like to read much, here's a mini review. It sucks, but at the same time it doesn't. There.
As for the people who will be happy to read this unnecessarily long review, I appreciate it.  
Just like a lot of people say, Sword Art Online comes off as an anime where you either love it or hate it to bits. I thought the first three episodes was excellent, introducing the virtual reality game, Sword Art Online, giving us the feel on what it is like to play the game (such as the boss battle) and psychological break down people
                  experience (which was shown in episode 3). But after that, it felt as if the writer decided to smoke crack and took a huge dump on his own story along with being completely out of ideas after that
The first biggest concern is the characters. No one has any depth to him or her. Asuna is introduced as a mysterious girl who kicks ass, turns out to be your generic annoying tsundere who I would like to teabag just to get them to shut the hell up. Kirito, for some stupid reason knows how to charm the chicks even though he spends his whole life staying inside his room playing games all day and is the most overpowered person in the game for some retarded reason, not to mention that he has absolutely no flaws. From what I witnessed, he is the ultimate unbeatable character throughout the whole show, so after getting to the second arc, you just know that he is going to obviously win the next battle. The rest of the characters are just your stereotypical harem baits that are not even relevant to the plot and are just there just to make the protagonist look like a chick magnet. But the villains…they are just bad. To not spoil anything about them (oh wait, what is there to spoil?), the villains have no motives of being evil and are just plot devices for the entire show. They come off as obnoxious and pathetic. Pffthahaha, I can’t believe Kirito praised Kayaba’s existence. 
The second biggest concern is definitely the writing. The writing and the story is absolutely horrible. Throughout watching the show, I kept predicting how old the writer is from time to time. The dialogue comes off as predictable, childish like, cliché and just utterly stupid. The romance was way too forced into the show and it felt as if the creator just did it so that Kirito could look more like a man if he had a girlfriend as a prop.  The romance was as poorly written, almost as poorly as the Twilight franchise. It’s like the writer guessed how romances work. Just because a guy meets a girl, doesn’t mean that you have to force love upon them. They don’t even have a good reason to like each other, Kirito sucks as a person and Asuna is nothing but a generic tsundere. Man I would have enjoyed the progression of the relationship more if they could include chapter 16.5 from the novel. Back to the topic. The dialogue between Kirito and Asuna. It’s…it’s bloody retarded. One of the most stupid scenes I thought was when Asuna told Kirito that she would kill herself if he dies. Really? They don’t know each other in real life and she is willing to take her own life because of some professional gamer? Bravo. Also throughout the whole show, the things Kirito and Asuna say to each other is absolutely predictable, you know when Asuna would go tsun and you would know when she would go dere. But what made the relationship between these two was when they introduced us to our beloved loli…Yui-chan. Bleh. At least Yui doesn’t come off as retarded as Fuko-chan from Clannad. God I want to strangle that kid and put her back in a coma. Ok spoiler alert, read at your own risk. Or probably you’ve already seen Sword Art Online so who cares. Yui is nothing but another plot device and a moeblob of the show. She starts calling Kirito and Asuna her parents because…THE HECK WOULD I KNOW? Then later on the newly wedded couple decided to keep her as a child and treat her as if they were actually her parents. “Awww, that’s so sweet…” No it’s not! It’s stupid. How old are these two again? 16 and 17. Wow it’s like I’m back to going on IMVU watching people create their own families because their real life family sucks.
More rants? Yes please. Cliché scenes! Or just dumb scenes! There is Deus Ex Machina writing everywhere. Because I don’t want to spoil the show much, I'll just say that even if he got killed inside the game, he still came back to life because...I don't know. It seems as if the writer couldn't think of anything good and decided to slap something random in just for the plot to progress and all I could think of is how lazy that writer is. Wow. But ass pulls gets even worse in the climax of the second arc. There was also a scene where Kirito just tries to sacrifice himself even though he could save himself along with the others, but the writer only does this just for the sake of shoving in more melodrama than this show already needs. But I won’t talk about that scene, because I would be “spoiling the show.” 
It actually seems like I’m bashing the anime too much so I guess I’ll talk about what makes this show good.
The soundtrack and music is absolutely amazing. Definitely the ones used in the action scenes. It just sounded so kickass. It actually makes you feel privileged to watch the show because of it. When players open the menu or whatever you like to call it, you feel you ears having an orgasm every time you hear those beepity boop sounds. The action scenes in this show is absolutely well done, being mixed with the soundtrack would have your eyes and ears peeled to the screen. You would know that this show had a lot of budget, it’s a shame it’s wasted on this pathetic excuse of an anime. Oops, I wasn’t meant to be ranting any more.
The other great thing about this show is that you can never get bored. Even when I noticed the flaws and started hating it while it was still being aired, I was having so much fun watching the show. When you watch Sword Art Online, you feel as if the episode is just zooming through really fast and you feel unsatisfied by the end of the episode and then you just want the next episode already(this is how I felt while it was still being aired.) The show actually knows how to engage you and immerse you into the virtual reality game and you feel as if you want to be in that game. Side stories were okay by me, since this anime introduces different ways on how the mechanics of the game works. Such as cooking, fishing, training, gaining exp to level up, finding rare items etc. There was so much things explored in this show and it makes you want to see more of this. Sadly these things are only shown in the first arc, the second arc is filled with “I have to save Asuna from this very bad man who does bad things because of plot!”
So overall, Sword Art Online is definitely an entertaining show, but it comes off as utterly stupid from cliché writing, bad characters and utterly horrible use of dialogues. This show is nothing more than a wish fulfilment show for otakus who would like anything generic. I actually would recommend it to people who are actually new to anime, because it’s shows like these that actually bring more western people into the anime world.  Even though Sword Art Online is a guilty pleasure, you would see it being a score of 1/10 in my list, since I’m one of those people who really hate it. But then again, who the hell has a neutral opinion of Sword Art Online. It’s either hating it or loving it. Overall I will give this show a kind of fair rating for this review with a solid score of…
3/10",3

                Sword art online, now what can I say that hasn't been said yet? Well, after reading through the reviews of this anime, I can tell that the reviewers seem to have mixed opinions about this it. The scores given to this anime are all over the place, ranging from 1 to 10. I am one of those people who really are enjoying the it, and I have reasons for them too. Now, at this point, it is quite clear that this anime has a very fast pace, which has turned quite a few people off toward this anime, but I don't really think that's fair,
                  because as of this point, there are only 10 episodes out of 25, so it's too early to judge. Even with the pacing issues, I still really enjoy it, and I really only notice the fast pacing in a selected few episodes, and those were side stories. Now, I've read the LN. Now I know that the LN is a better experience, however I was very impressed with the execution. Though a few episodes had pacing problems, it was only the side stories, when the anime reached the main plot, the pacing felt MUCH better. Now, I know that a lot of people criticize this anime due to its pacing, but also with its characters, plot and cliches. I don't tend to nitpick on cliches, because I don't see a reason to, if we always nitpicked about cliches, then that will just take away the enjoyment of the anime. 
Story:
Now, first let's talk about the story. I really like the story, even though the whole virtual reality concept isn't new, the feeling of it just separates itself from those others. Basically, there is this new game called sword art online, which is the first virtual reality game made, and of course, people are extremely eager to buy this game. Around ten thousand people have bought this game, and are trying it out, including our MC. So, the mc just entered this virtual world, along with the other 10 000 people, but then they realize that this game, there is no logout button. After that, they learn that they can not only can they not logout, but a death in this game will result in a death in real life. Now the story may not sound like much, it actually is very deep when you look at it. To me, it feels like the game creator wanted to this game like real life, because the concept is something like real life, except for stuff like item drops and other RPG elements. This show also includes quite a lot of psychological elements to it. The normal person would think that in this situation, everyone would freak out and go insane, now that is true, and it was inplemented into the anime at the beginning, so I don't understand people saying this is unrealistic. Because this is a virtual reality, it is quite like real life, except with RPG stuff, and these people are all gamers, so of course over time, they will adapt to this new world. The story is pretty much that, because the majority of the story is character interactions. Well, being trapped in a virtual game for 2 years, of course there wouldn't be much else to show but characters and their interactions with eachother.
Characters:
Now, it may not say this, but this anime is defiantly a harem, as a lot of girls seem to take a liking to the mc with their time spent together. Most of the harem stuff is from the side stories, but that's to be expected. The main story however mainly focuses on the romance between 2 characters, which is nice. after reading the reviews, I find people lacking the enjoyment of the characters, which makes sense, because of the fast pace kind of affecting the character development, but I still think the characters are very likable and have so much more depth than what other people say about them being one-dimensional. So the mc is pretty much an average guy in real life, but ingame, he is a badass solo player who is probably one of the strongest players in the game. Now, that has to due with him being a beta tester. Since he played the game before, he knew where the good places are for grinding exp. many players despise him due to him being a beta tester, so they give him the title ""beater"" now as you can probably tell, this guy doesnt fool around,mwhen the game master announced the part about not being able to logout, he quickly gets over it and moves toward his goal. Which also explains his success as a player, since I don't think he spent his time fooling around during the beta test like some others. The character interaction is very well done. He pretty much solos everything because he doesn't want to feel responsible for the deaths of his teammates. Also in episode 3, it pretty much explains why he solos stuff, he joined a guild, and lied about his level so it would be more likely to except him, but I also think he did that so he could fit in more, so he didn't feel so different from them. He made friends with people in that guild, but he was a beater, so the title came back to bite when his guild fell for a trap and all died. After that, he felt if he told the truth, he could have warned them, since they would know he has more experience about it, and so he begins to feel guilty. Also when he tries to get the revive crystal, he tells people he has to fight by himself, or else if someone else dies in the process, there would be no point. I really think the characters are very deep, and I don't like to complain like others how he is so overpowered, and appears to get girls all over him, even though this game contains mostly male players. But remember, the mc has a good personality, and it perp is way of dealing with difficult situations that made him so powerful, so I won't complain about that like people who blindly watch the show and complain. 
Sound:
One word, ""AMAZING"" I really love it, the soundtracks fit this medieval setting perfect, and the music playing during boss battles makes it sound epic. Also the opening theme is very lovable. I also love the sound affects like when they charge the swords. 
Art:
Beautiful, they set the virtual setting very nicely, and the character designs are very good, what more do I need to say?
Enjoyment:
I really enjoyed the anime, and many others have too. I tend to overlook those common complaints, and I really think it is more enjoyable when you think about the story and characters more, because there is much more logic than when you just watch with your eyes. 
All in all, a very good series, and I definitely recommend it!",9

                Sword Art Online, was a potential epic anime, the story was great, on the fact that there are players trapped in a virtual reality game and that if they die in the game, THEY DIE IN REAL LIFE! Honestly how can it get any better... Was what I first thought... This anime disappointed me, it turned into a horrendous harem all of a sudden as our main protagonist was wooing the hearts of our female characters, and to add to that, it was like 20% action and 50% slice of life and 30% of romance! Also it was incredibly short and they skipped out like
                  4 or 5 months each episode! But around episode 14 the game is completed as our main protagonist, Kirito defeats the final boss, Kayaba Akihiko, the creation of the game. Everyone who survived was released though unfortunately, those who died in the game, remain dead...
A new arc had appeared with a new MMO. This time one of Kirito's dear friends was not released and is trapped in the new MMO, AlfHeim Online (ALO). He goes into the game and teams up with another female protagonist (as if we didn't see that coming -_-) to save his friend. This arc is terrible in my opinion, they act like death in the game is a big deal when really, you remain alive?! so why make a big deal out of it?!
Overall this is a decent anime, which is too overrated, but worth checking out. I give this anime a 4/10. Peace!
P.S. this is my first review btw",4
"
                	Sword Art Online was one of the first animes I’ve watched. Because of all the hype that surfaced upon its release, I had rather high expectations for SAO. I wouldn’t say that I was completely disappointed by it, but I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t. I don’t think that SAO was as bad as some people chalked it up to be, but I can definitely see where those people were coming from. Either way, after I watched the last episode, I stared at my computer screen for a little while, grieving over all of the lost potential. That being said, I watched
                  it quite some time ago, so my apologies if anything in here is inaccurate. 
	Story: 5/10
	The premise of it (not the execution) was rather interesting and it had so much potential to be a decent anime. (Honestly, it had the chance to be a great anime, but I digress.) The first three or so episodes set the scene for the rest of the show, but after that it went downhill. There were so many fillers in the beginning that really didn’t have anything to do with the rest of the plot. Sure, it showed Kirito in action, but overall, those episodes could have been omitted and not much would have been affected. All they served to do was introduce a bunch of characters who didn’t really make any appearances in later episodes. In fact, the characters introduced just fell in love with Kirito and were shown for maybe two seconds in the last episode(s) to show how jealous they were over Kirito and Asuna’s relationship. 
	When they returned to the main (I use that term lightly) plot of the first arc, things were all over the place and overall, things made sense and there was a resolution. But, there were still ten episodes left. So, why not just rehash the first arc and plop them back into a virtual world? Honestly, I’m not going to go into detail about the Alfheim arc because this would take up an entire page. It was flat and clichéd and I did not like it. 
	Characters: 4/10
	So, let’s begin with our main protagonist, Kirito. I hate using this term, but he was a generic Gary-Stu. He doesn’t have any flaws (evident ones at least) and a bunch of girls fall for him. And of course, of all the girls in his harem, he falls for the girl who at first didn’t like him but eventually warms up. Who saw that coming? Also, Kirito overpowers his enemies rather easily. I’m not much of a gamer, but from what I’ve seen, it takes more than a couple of flashy sword slashes to take down supposedly powerful enemies. Kirito is overall a flat character. 
	Next we have our demi protagonist, Asuna. She’s beautiful, badass, and can cook. I had rather high hopes for her; before I watched SAO, I saw her as a strong fighter who was still pretty. However, in the middle of the first arc, Kirito started making all of her decisions for her and she become completely reliant on him. Sure, she could still hold her own and poke things with her sword, but she didn’t do anything. The second arc didn’t help her cause: Asuna was locked away in a tower and even though she sought to find a way out, it obviously didn’t work. I’ve heard arguments that she had to be mentally strong while she was in there, and I agree. Yet, while that holds true, we didn’t get to see any of her mental strength. What we did see was her crying and praying for her beloved Kirito to save her. After the first arc, all she served to do was provide (rather creepy) fanservice and sit around, waiting for Kirito.
	Yui is their “child”. She’s adorable and helps her daddy cheat the game to find Asuna. I didn’t really expect much from her, but the thing that annoys me about her was the fact that she was probably around eight/nine years old and spoke like a two-year-old. Maybe this was just me being picky, but that was unsettling.
	Next is Suguha/Leafa. Not many people like her for obvious reasons, but I honestly think that she is one of the better characters of the show. She infamously falls in love with Kirito twice even though they’re siblings/cousins/I’m not really sure anymore. However, the fact that she still helps Kirito and tries to be happy for him and Asuna shows that she does, in fact, have a personality. I actually like Suguha and she’s my favorite character in SAO. (Although that really doesn’t say much because I don’t really like any character in it.)
	The rest of the characters were all brushed aside and for the most part, useless. (Including the villains whose names I don’t remember, which goes to show exactly how much SAO developed the supporting characters.)
	Art: 9/10
	There isn’t much to say here. The art is beautiful and the character designs were great for the most part. However, the fact that Kirito basically has the same appearance in Alfheim as he does in the real world was confusing. They could have at least made him look a little different, but like I said, that might just be my nitpickiness.  
	Sound: 8/10	
	The openings and endings are wonderful, but that’s not a hard thing to do. I said earlier that Yui’s voice irritated me, but those aren’t really problems when compared to the overall issues with SAO.
	Enjoyment: 4/10	
	I’m not really sure what to even put here; I definitely enjoyed some facets of SAO, such as the animation and music, but for the most part, it fell flat. The fillers did provide some entertainment and some moments were heartwarming.
	Overall: 4/10	
	In general, I was disappointed by SAO and the amount of fans is has baffles me. I would not re-watch it and it was a let down for me. There were some high aspects of it, but pretty animation and nice music doesn’t make up for stale characters and a bland plot.",4

                PART ONE
EPISODES 1-14
Sword Art Online is one of the greatest achievements in anime. This is not because it’s good, it’s because people actually watch this show and think they’re watching something that’s worth their time. Go to any mall and you’ll find that your local Hot Topic and FYE are covered in pictures of Kirito and Asuna. Go to any convention and you’re going to be surrounded by people who think Sword Art Online is  something worth cosplaying. Populate any forum and you’re bound to find tons of people defending the shit out of a show that makes no sense, has very little characterization,
                  takes itself way too seriously, and is a goddam trainwreck from beginning to end.
But instead of bitching at people who like it, let’s bitch at the show itself. For those who don’t know, it’s a series surrounding the idea that a bunch of players get trapped inside a virtual reality RPG and the only way to escape is to clear the game. If they die in the game, they die in real life. Okay, that’s a pretty decent set-up for a death game scenario. But then it gets stupid. The game was apparently created by a company where no one said “Hey, this death game thing is kind of fucked up.”  Then you get to the death game scenario and all the rules. If the headsets are pulled off in the real world, the person will die. If the headset is disconnected from an outlet, there is a battery that will fry the persons brain if they die. So no one will ever figure out to drain the battery, take the damn helmets off, and save the fucking people early on.
Our main hero is Kirito, a beta tester who’s one of  the most wooden characters in any anime. He has the emotional capacity of celery and is as interesting to watch as tennis. After seeing a guild die and being blamed for not helping save people (as he was a beta tester), he decides to go full emo and become a loner. But every episode after this is about him teaming up with some damsel in distress, completely throwing aside the lone wolf persona. Time goes by in between these episodes, sometimes months or even a year, but it would be a good idea to throw in something that shows him working alone to reinforce the idea rather than make him out to be such a “badass” then have him team up over and over.
Kirito is a pussy magnet. He’s picking up girls left and right in a ridiculous manner. At first it’s Silica, the obligatory loli whose episode adds nothing to the series. Then it’s Lisbeth, whose episode adds nothing to the series. Then it’s Asuna. The development between Asuna and Kirito is so fucking fast that you’ll think you’re missing about ten episodes. They go from liking each other, to sharing their first kiss, to marrying, to having a child in the span of two or three episodes. This is how fast the series moves. It doesn’t think to slow down and expand upon anything or build characters, it wants to get over with as much as we want it over with.
Kirito can do no wrong which is my biggest problem with him. He’s overpowered to the point that any action scenes lose all drama. He helps everyone despite any sort of danger. He’s so dull. Even when he’s in emotional situations he’s  fucking boring. And to add to that is his awful dialogue. At one point he and Asuna are watching the sunset on a porch. He says, and I am not kidding you, “Don’t fall over the balcony. That would suck.” It’s completely out of place dialogue, doesn’t fit the scene, is really awkward, and pervades his character through the whole series. At one point he fucking says that NPCs are real people. He’s….Jesus he’s terrible.
Then we have Asuna. Asuna starts off pretty badass. She’s hot, she’s powerful, she’s graceful. But then she falls apart. She depends on Kirito to save her, becomes a damsel in distress despite being second in command of the most powerful guild in the game. One minute she’s murdering something, the next discussing marriage in completely awkward dialogues with Kirito. Then she’s the best cook around. Then she wants a leave of absence from the Knights of the Blood Oath and can’t get it unless Kirito battles for her (and of course, she has no say despite being the second in command?). And then she’s all tears and hiding behind Kirito and contributing to the most boring romance in anime history. “I love you.” “I love you.” “I love you.” “We barely know each other, got married inside a game after not even dating, we’re probably two totally different people in the real world, but I fucking love you. Let’s be together forever!”
Then you have Silica and Liz. Both are in love with Kirito, both contribute nothing to the show. They’re fap bait. Are you fapping yet?
One of the problems with this anime is how serious it takes itself despite being so full of stupidity. And that may be what ultimately ruins this series. It’s so fast, it’s so sexualized, and it’s so stupid that it’s hard to watch it with a serious face. Half an episode is dedicated to fishing and the next half is a huge boss fight. It’s so badly paced and inconsistent because of that. It spends whole episodes on pointless characters and subplots instead of focusing on the main thread. And when it does focus on the main story, it goes so fast you barely have time to think about what you watched. I have a theory that if the Aincrad arc was twenty-six episodes, this series would actually be good. It’d give the characters enough room to breathe and develop, give the plot enough time to build, and give the viewer enough time to figure out what the hell they’re watching. Instead, in fourteen episodes we clear up the kind of plot that would take any other series one or two full seasons to finish satisfactorily.
And, I feel, if the anime had spent more time focusing on the Aincrad arc I could forgive the stupid parts more. I could forgive the fact Kirito and Asuna saw a fucking ghost inside a video game. I could forgive the “DONT LOOK AT MY PANTIES KIRITO” Silica scene. I could forgive the “DONT LOOK AT MY PANTIES EVEN THOUGH WE’RE IN LOVE BAKA” Asuna scene. I could forgive more because it wouldn’t be such concentrated stupidity. But, it is what it is, and what it is is stupid.
Like, I can’t even express all of the problems I had with it because there were so many. From beginning to end it’s full of dumb  scenes, bad writing, terrible directing. We have a depressing scene about a dead friend and we focus on the girls ass as the dramatic music plays. Running from a powerful boss, Kirito and Asuna run toward the camera as the camera spins like a record. There is an  introduction to dismemberment when Kirito loses his hand  and then he grows it back and dismemberment is never used again. Where’s the explanation of the special skills like dual-wielding other than they are convenient plot devices?  All kinds of small, silly things that compound to make this such an unappealing package.
And then there’s the end.
Asuna and Kirito are married. They adopt a girl named Yui. Of course, she turns out to be super powerful and some sort of psychological counseling service for the game. What the fuck? Since when have RPGs had psychologist AI to take care of the suicidal people sick and tired of having to grind? She winds up disappearing and Kirito uses a console to save her data to his headset and turn her heart into a pendant. Because he magically knows how to use a command console…what?
The series doesn’t end on level one hundred, the final level of the game, it ends on level seventy-five. Kirito defeats the final boss on this level. It’s a complete tease, ending things super early and nonsensically. Asuna dies, Kirito dies, the guy who created the game dies. But they all meet together and watch the world fall apart. And then they ask why the guy built the game and wanted to kill people  and he says “Eh, I don’t remember.”
Amazing.
And despite dying, Asuna and Kirito still survive. Like…what the fuck happened? Episode fourteen is bullshit. It makes no sense.
You want to like Sword Art Online. It’s got cute girls, it’s got excellent animation, it’s got good music. But it’s so fucking bad. It’s a broken pile of garbage with very few redeeming qualities. There are a few episodes that are pretty decent, but it’s overall so plagued with stupid that those glimmers of hope are stomped out. There are ways to fix it too. Make the Aincrad arc longer, don’t prematurely ejaculate your story on episode fourteen, make Kirito likeable, don’t take yourself seriously. This is not a recommended show. In fourteen episodes it’s proven itself juvenile and weak in nearly every creative process. I didn’t even mention half the problems with the Aincrad arc for brevity’s sake, so you can only imagine what else is wrong here. Just watch .Hack.I promise it’s better.
And….I still have eleven episodes left of this season. And then a whole second season that started airing a few days ago.
God save my soul.
PART TWO
EPISODES 15-25
Many people pan the second half of Sword Art Online more than the first and, truthfully, I don’t get it. Compared to the first arc this second arc is so much better paced, with a lot more emotional attachment to the plot and characters. That’s not to say that it isn’t stupid, because from the outset it’s really dumb. But it manages to make me care about the series and want to see it come to a satisfying conclusion. Much like the first arc, though, it prematurely ejaculates its’ story, leaving a protracted epilogue, and it also throws in another few vaginas for Kirito to plunder. But aside from that…I’m really not that disgusted with this arc.
Asuna is stuck inside of virtual reality after her consciousness has been transferred to a different game built on the same engine as Sword Art Online, this one called Alfheim Online. Kirito finds out about it after pictures leak of Asuna’s avatar stuck inside a bird cage. He also learns that she is to be married off to an up-and-coming member of Asuna’s father’s company, a total creep who sniffs her hair and touches her all over with a perpetual rape face. Now our hero must enter a new virtual reality, battle his way to the top, and save the love of his life.
There are a number of problems with this scenario, the main one being the fact that a game was developed while players were trapped in Sword Art Online based on Sword Art Online’s engine and servers. That’s just plain stupid. On top of that is the arranged marriage between Asuna and Sugou. Asuna hates him so he’s created some sort of mind control/mind changing system by using the NerveGears to manipulate her and other players to his control. That’s dumb. Really dumb.
But despite all that the journey to save Asuna is decently paced, much better than the first arc. There’s one episode where Kirito and his companion, Leafa, backtrack for some internal politics that don’t matter and only serve as a reason to create an ass-saving scenario later in the story, but otherwise I was impressed that it stayed on track and kept me interested.
That said, there is the niggling problem of Suguha. I have a love/hate relationship with her character. She’s Kirito’s sister in the real world who’s madly in love with him because they’re not really related and blah-blah-blah. That’s stupid. Even stupider is how coincidental it is that Leafa, her in-game avatar, and Kirito end up meeting up inside a game with thousands of players, befriend each other, she falls in love with the Kirito avatar to try to take her mind off her brother, and then the avatar winds up being her brother. That is so contrived and stupid and adds a drama level that is completely unneeded. And the worst part is, Suguha is the best female character in the entire fucking show. She’s the one female lead who’s…kind of strong. Sure she’s madly in love with her brother, sure she’s looking for love and cries about it; but she doesn’t get kidnapped or become the damsel-in-distress  (like Asuna, Liz, Silica). She doesn’t need to be saved except for that one little introduction to Leafa. If the brother love hadn’t been there, I feel she would have been an excellent character. As she is, she’s still pretty good.
Kirito, to his credit, gets to be a lot more bearable toward the end of the show, mostly due to the drama of the plot and tensions between the characters. The second-to-last episode and the first few minutes of the final episode, he’s really fucking cool. I mean, he goes back to being boring as hell in the end, but I can commend that the writers were able to make the lamest character ever really awesome for a few minutes.
I mention a lot of things that shouldn’t be associated with this anime such as drama and good characters. Let me explain here why this half of the show works better than the first.
The bad guy.
Plain and simple. A lot of people I’ve talked to about the show give Sugou a lot of shit because he’s the guy who licks Asuna’s tears and sniffs her hair. But, the question is, doesn’t that make you hate him? He’s the kind of villain you want to see get his ass kicked. He’s got a retarded, diabolical James Bond villain plan, he’s feeling up the hero’s girl like a sex doll, he’s got a great evil laugh, he cries like a bitch when he gets hurt. He’s fantastic. In the first half of the series there is a villain but we don’t know him. He shows up at the beginning and at the end but nowhere in there do we see characterization. Nowhere can we say “Damn, that guy is diabolical.” He’s just there to be the catalyst for a story. Hell, he even tells Kirito and Asuna he doesn’t know why he did what he did, which is really weak story telling. But with Sugou, you understand why he’s doing what he’s doing; he wants the company president’s daughter. He’s batshit insane and he’ll get what he wants no matter what.
And this is why I enjoyed the second arc. I was invested in seeing this guy get his ass whooped (and boy, that was a good ass-whooping). I wasn’t really invested in Asuna and Kirito getting back together, though the romance between them during this period was kind of sweet (then when they get back together it’s as dull as ever). I was invested in the journey and the destination. The Aincrad arc didn’t do that. It was too scatterbrained, didn’t really have a concrete destination. That’s why this arc worked so much better.
It was still stupid though. I can admit that. The random girls falling in love with Kirito, the game master from Sword Art Online giving Kirito control of the entire game, the exceptionally overlong epilogue that made the romance between Asuna and Kirito go from the emotional focal point of the plot to the emotional focal point of why I wanted to stop watching. The tentacle rape scene. The directorship, where the camera is focusing on girl’s asses during emotional scenes rather than…I don’t know, the faces that show emotions?
So what can I say about Sword Art Online overall? It’s bad on so many levels. The characters are (for the most part) bad, the plot is stupid, and it’s full of idiotic moments and bad pacing. But, for all that, it’s still entertaining on a dumb, popcorn-movie level. It has enough easily entertaining fight scenes, enough accessible characters, enough of a semblance of a plot, that it manages to keep you watching. The first arc is barely worth watching, to tell the truth, but it’s still mildly entertaining. Alfheim Online is so much better though and picks the series off the ground, allowing it to at least crawl somewhere. It never stands up and walks or even runs, but at least there is some progress for nine episodes. Then it’s back on it’s ass going nowhere and wondering where it’s at.
Is the Alfheim arc worth watching? I think it’s decent enough to give a watch. Is the series as a whole worth your time? I don’t think so. If you’re looking for dumb fun, you’ve found it, but if you’re looking for cohesion or any sort of finesse, you’ll have to look elsewhere.",4

                Quality != Popularity. Implying, or wrongly stating that it does is a fallacy. I will begin this affirming: SAO is bad, not because it's popular, because it's bad.  SAO has a really awful beginning that can't decide what to do with itself. It sets itself up as a Batsu game, but then never really expands on the subject, instead choosing to try and make it a grim and dark shounen, but that doesn't really work out either. It then tries being a mystery show, and was actually okay for the two episodes it tried, but that's all it accomplished.
The story starts picking up around
                  the middle of the first season where it goes off on this romantic story between two players, and the guild affairs of the game. Honestly, most of the first half of season one was literally just setting this up, regardless of all the plot holes and idiotic story design elements and bad pacing. So it's pretty good. And then the first season randomly ends before the game is finished. Oh, hey, I'm the final boss. Let's fight for no reason away from the last floor.. This would have been fine, except they clearly didn't know what to do with themselves at this point, because they immediately set up another poorly placed ridiculous storyline that almost mimics the conditions of the first season, except without any of the negative penalties. ""Oh no! Don't die or. . .you might be kinda. . .inconvenienced?"" There's nothing really at stake other than time, and the villain is laughably two dimensional.
There is nothing redeemable about SAO aside from the soundtrack and occasionally decent animation. It had potential but everything was wasted from the writing. 
You can enjoy bad anime if you want, but do not try to act like it's actually good in any way. This is why SAO fans annoy me -- not because they like it, but because they think it's amazing in the face of all the glaring issues. They disregard valid complaints with ""well I found it fun!"" and only cherrypick the bad arguments instead of addressing the ones that matter. 
I can barely enjoy anything for the cute girls and the sexual appeal. SAO doesn't even have that. It's just a shell of a series that had potential but never utilized it. It's nothing more than a bad anime with good production values, and no matter how good the soundtrack and how flashy it looks, I cannot enjoy awful storytelling for those two aspects alone. Every time I feel like I'm about to enjoy the series, it goes right back to its problems due to the lack of talent from the writer. He tries so hard that it's actually embarrassing to watch.",1

                Ah, Sword Art Online...you had so much potential.  I don't think there's a single one of us who read the synopsis for this series and said, ""That sounds boring.""  Indeed, if it had been crafted better, this could have been one of the best anime of 2012.  Instead I feel it is a colossal waste.
Story - 3/10 - After things get going, the first few episodes of the series are basically comprised of filler, which is never a good sign.  Kirito undertakes side quests that may as well be marked by a bright yellow exclamation point for how generic and dull
                  they are.  Most of the characters he meets are relatively interesting, until you realize that they never appear beyond the episode of their introduction.  What should be a time for gathering comrades and developing characters instead becomes a crazy, disjointed path that leaves the viewer wondering.  Time lapses are used frequently between episodes, because somehow there were even more trivial events which couldn't be shown on screen.
Season 1 redeems itself pretty well in the latter half in my opinion, which is when the series is at its best.  A cohesive story follows, and we're not meandering between useless might-as-well-be-NPC's anymore.  The ending of season 1 was truly satisfying, and if I could rate the entire series based on that, it would probably get about an 8.  Unfortunately however, we got a second season, and it never really takes flight (pun intended).  All of the momentum from season 1 is lost as the badass Kirito is transformed into a brooding weakling with a one-track mind, fighting a villain who is cartoonishly laughable in his demeanor and stupidity.  Yawn.
Characters - 2/10 - It's a harsh score, but honestly, Kirito and Asuna were the only interesting characters in the entire series, and they both got gutted by the time season 2 came around.  It's not that the supporting cast is unlikeable, but you're never given any time to get to know them.  The ones you do get to know are usually annoying or irrational.
Art 5/10 & Sound 7/10 -  I'll preface this as always by saying that I am not a big art/sound guy.  I rate primarily on the other factors.  The animation was solid, but certainly not breathtaking.  It did a pretty good job of making you feel like you are in a generic fantasy world, which I think is what they were going for, actually, since it's an MMO.  The soundtrack itself is quite good, but the music never seemed to accent the dramatic moments in the series.
Enjoyment - 5/10 - I liked it mostly because of the premise being very unique, and the fact that it had some nice high points.  Though it may not seem like it, my score reflects optimism.  I will certainly be checking out the manga in hopes that this is just another anime series which can't echo its print version faithfully.
Overall - 4/10 - Given all 25 episodes to the first arc, I think this could have been a great series.  Action fans won't be disappointed (at first), and there's enough here for lovers of both anime and MMOs to grab onto.  Still, Sword Art Online is predictable, cliched, bland, and lacking any real depth.  It begins with a seductive whisper, but ends with a night of friendzone disappointment.",4

                The anime everyone's heard about. The one that was all over tumblr, mentioned on facebook - it was everywhere for the time it was being shown. ...was it worth it? Yeah, not really at all it's a truly trashy series, but hey! It wasn't all bad! Except for the fact that that barely flippin' helps. At all.
The story of SAO is actually adequate at first. It pulls you in, it's interesting! That is, until the INFAMOUS third episode. Yes, this is not a certain other VRMMO (virtual reality mmo) show, but. The person who wrote SAO's novel, who had no IDEA of that other show,
                  did write something at the same time. However, instead of turning this work in, they did not. So for all these years, how much does one have to revise? Exactly. Now, back to the anime's story. Yes, it's interesting. Up until the third episode where Sachi, a minor character, is killed. The main male lead, the protagonist, Kirito, does not react. A LIVING HUMAN WAS KILLED, and he did not care all that much. Yes, he was shocked. Was he saddened? No.
There are a lot of emotional parts in SAO those are not bad. They can give you feels. However, there are so many fillers and strange aspects, that it all goes down the drain in the end, there's no lie there.
The art is a lot of things. It's ""high quality,"" but what about the style? Everyone looks a child, excluding a few characters. Everyone's face are blobby. Like moe-blobs, in a way. Their eyes are similar, big, and shiny. If you switched the girls' hairstyles and eye colors around, would you be able to recognize them? The animation's fluid, the effects are great, but the way everything is executed is not. All in all, it's above average, but not stupendous far from it.
Ah, the sound. The bgm is good! The songs? Lisa singing the opening... Now, Lisa is a great singer. Crossing Field, however, I can't say is a very good song. It's overrated at most and this is something I'm -really- gosh darn sure about. The future opening and endings are much better! However, that's personal opinion and music taste, so that's up to you. This is one of SAO's few saving graces.
Oh, Kirito. At first, an anti-social person. There's nothing wrong with that. He made mistakes. What about the rest of the series? No. After that, he is PERFECT. Every girl wants him, every guy wants to be him, the antagonists want him to badly suffer. He's depicted as THE best. Kirito becomes an actual 2D character in the personality and depiction part. Now, Asuna, his ""waifu."" She is shown to be perfect, even more, than he is. She's the ""only"" one who can cook, everyone wants her, she's depicted as the most beautiful character in the entire series. At first, she can fight! She really can! Then, she becomes a damsel in distress, which isn't entirely her fault, but you know, strong female lead becomes... ??? She's also not the only girl who can cook, but that's what people think. Everyone forgets that she's portrayed as the most perfect girl you could be in the world of SAO. ...making these two THE strongest in this anime ruins nearly everything. Of course they'll win sooner or later.
One of the later antagonists becomes enamored with Asuna. Before they can leave the game, an older man tries to take Asuna from Kirito, because she's stuck in another VRMMO. Yes, that's right. He violates her in front of Kirito, so he'll get angry. Yepp. Some random guy just decides to do this. The characters? Nice try, but not really.
My enjoyment of this series... I honestly thought I'd like it, I really did. That all fell apart early on. I enjoyed the emotional bits, the fluid-ness of the animation, the action scenes, the effects. The story was no, the art style was no, the characters definitely not. There you have it. A not so enjoyable experience, that could've gone right. Maybe, honestly.
Overall, SAO gets pretty much a 3 from me. Notable, but not note-worthy to watch. At. All. I apologize to all fans, but this just wasn't my idea of an amazing anime. Thanks a bunch for reading, though!",3
"
                While this anime isn't perfect, it sure as hell isn't no where near as bad as what people have been saying and expressing in their reviews. It's not the perfect anime that some people make it out to be either, but NO anime is perfect in that regard.
Story- The story isn't something unique, the whole ""If you die in the game, you die in real life"" scenario has been done before, but does not having a unique story make it any less impactful or good? The answer is no, take a look at something like clannad where the story in a sense is very generic,
                  boy meets girl, they fall in love, and then something tragic happens. Certainly not a unique story at all, but look at how impactful it was, I've honestly never been that torn up over something in my entire life. What makes a story good is not necessarily being unique, but rather how the story impacts you. Will you remember these characters or certain scenes months or even years down the road? Will it be something that impacts you in a certain way, or make you realize something about yourself? The answer is yes to all of these questions. Don't get me wrong, this anime has plenty of faults, and it pains me to say that because this anime could have easily been a 10/10 and made it's way into my top 5. It had so much going for it, and yet it felt extremely rushed in the first couple of episodes, some characters weren't around long enough to even care about, even when certain scenes made it clear that you were suppose to care. It's hard to care for a character when you've really only had an episode or so to get to know them, it's certainly alot less impactful in certain areas than what it was suppose to be. Then in other areas it's extremely impactful and has done things that I personally haven't ever seen done in an anime, a few scenes in particular. This is why i'm so on the fence about this anime, some scenes were so wonderfully done, and other scenes fell extremely short of what they were going for. Even with it's faults this anime is still an 8/10 for me, at the beginning it was registering about a 4/10 for me, but then the anime picked up and really started showing it's charm, how amazing it could be and just how much potential it had. I was definitely happy watching this anime and it was certainly not a waste of time like most people seem to say it is. After the first couple of episodes of this anime and the way things seem to be going you might have a general idea of where things are going, and you couldn't be more wrong. It's alot more morbid than you would first believe, and the ending scene of the ""first season"" just shows how morbid of an anime this can be at times. It also a very romantic anime, it one of the best couples I've seen in a long time. The story starts off slow, then really starts to pick up after the first couple of episodes, and I mean really pick up. It's a wonderful, yet morbid and sometimes loving story that I think people look over because of it's very obvious faults at the beginning.
Art-The art style is really good for the most part. All of the weapons, armor, and environment seem very much like something that you would find in a traditional mmo. All of the fight scenes are animated very well, nothing more to really say.
Sound-The musical scores hit where they are suppose to, whether it be fast paced music for fight scenes, or something soothing and mellow for a sweet scene. The opening and closing songs are really quite catchy and match the atmosphere of the anime very well.
Character- The characters are really well done, for the most part at-least. As I said in the story section, some of the characters aren't well fleshed out all that well, it's not that they where wrote badly or anything, you just didn't get to know them at all. You can't really feel any sort of emotion towards someone you know hardly anything about. The main characters however are done really well. Kirito and asuna in specific are wrote very well. You see them grow throughout the anime and learn from their mistakes. Their personalities even change for the better and they grow as humans. They seem very organic and very much alive for fictional characters.
Enjoyment-My overall enjoyment at the beginning was very minimum, besides the first episode. The first episode really draws you in, but then it gets very jumpy the next couple of episodes and makes it feel like you where missing whole out on alot. It even feels like some episodes where missing or something. After a rocky start things start to pick up, and it starts really showing off it's charm, and naturally you start enjoying yourself more. It had really enjoyable fighting scenes, and really touching emotional scenes.
Overall-Overall this anime could have been alot better, but at the same time it was alot better than I had originally though it would be. The way people are writing and talking about it make it seem like it's one of the worst things ever composed, almost like it's an abomination that should not be seen by human eyes, for fear of blindness. Sure it had some issues here and there, but overall it's a very well done (albeit rushed in some parts) anime. It had some really emotional and rather awesome scenes that I will definitely remember for years to come. Some of the scenes with kirito and asuna are just amazing, I don't see how people can talk so bad about it after witnessing such scenes. It might not have been perfect, but it definitely was a overall well done and entertaining anime. If you are wanting to watch a really good action anime, with a rather unique romance side to it then I reccomend this to you. You definitely won't be disappointed.",9

                I will update the review once the anime is finished, or when the anime gets to an interesting point/development
Sword art online is probably the most anticipated anime in this summer season, and it maybe the best in my opinion. Although there are a lot of critics saying that the anime is no where as good as the light novel series, but with 25 episodes its hard to focus on everything especially if the novel is up to its 10th volume, but who knows there might be a season 2.
Story 8
The story follows Kirigaya Kazuto with his game alias ""Kirito,"" a ""solo"" player that was part
                  of the beta in the game and his journey to clear the 100 floors, being part of the squad that is always on the front lines he is well known, and is called the black swordsman due to his clothes. His adventure leads him to meet many different kind of people, each one changing a bit of Kirito maybe in the future he would no longer be a solo player? i'll have to wait and see=P. 
There are massive leaps in the time line such as in the first 2 episodes their like on floor 1 or 2, but in the 3rd episode there on 20 something? and Kirito is around level 40. It makes it really confusing  because you don't really know what happened between, it would have been cool to show Kirito levelling to be honest, seeing it will probably remind the days of when i was levelling on a MMO. plus the fact that they don't continue on after each episode kinda sucks coz theres none of that cliff hanger feeling =/ but i guess i haven't exactly finished the anime yet so who knows it might occur in the future its only just begun, but i heard that the massive time leaps happen in the light novel as well. Although only side stories has only been released, the fact that i find them pretty good already hopefully the main story will be amazing as well. 
But to be honest what i think makes this story amazing its how you don't really get bored when your watching the episode or at least you don't lose attention, it constantly engages you, its kinda the feeling you get when watching Full metal alchemist brotherhood where you cant help but keep on watching.
Art 8
Being released in 2012 it'll be surprising if the animation was bad. The character designs are very well done in this, the female characters kinda remind of some characters from guilty crown such as Asuna quite similar to inori as in the face not the hair style and stuff. The background is absolutely amazing, with so much detail, looking at some of the background will truly astonish you. The fight scenes are pretty cool, although there is little magic or skills involved despite this being a MMORPG, you only get to hear the skill name you don't really see it in action, the sword fights are pretty cool i think there pretty well animated i like the way when people disappear they kinda disintegrate, plus i like the way the monster/players are cut as well and i like what they do with the menu really makes it feel like a game.
Sound 9
The opening is pretty well done, the song is pretty catchy and is sang by LiSA who i find pretty good, she did the opening and ending for Angel Beats! and the Girls Dead Monster songs she also sang the opening for Fate/Zero. The opening video hardly spoils anything only showing characters and very little bits of fight scenes unlike some anime opening video's which spoil a lot for you like Shakugan no Shana... I quite like the OST in this anime, it really set the mood in some of the sad scenes/fight scenes it draws your attention more towards it. Especially the fight scenes it makes it more exciting to watch, and its one of those things where when you hear the OST again you will remember the scene.
Character 9
I quite like the characters in SAO, Kirito is your typical lone wolf that when something bad happens he takes it really personally, in real life he didn't really socialise much with the outside world, so being in a game that completely reflects your life its kinda hard for him to interact with other players in the game. Probably one of the reason why he is a ""solo player"" although not the only reason, other reason include bad experiences during the game, such as deaths and etc. Although it's pretty interesting to watch when he helps people out despite being a solo player.
Asuna is one of the few pretty girls in SAO and to be honest a girl in an MMO is not very common, she also fights in the front lines aswell, with the title ""flash"" that she gained due to her skill lighting fast attacks. Her personality provides plenty of comical moments, she's basically an innocent teenager, that gets easily embarrassed when topics around relationships come up or when embarrassing things happen, you can probably image what kind of comical scenes will come up cant you =P. I think SAO focuses on the relationship between Asuna and Kirito, although its not completely clear yet as only 6 episodes are out, i am definitely a fan of Kirito X Asuno =P. 
I'm not completely sure if the characters currently introduced are side or main characters due to the fact that they only appeared once, but each female character seems to basically fall for Kirito and affects his mental state somehow whether in a positive or negative way.
Enjoyment 9 
For me personally this Anime really pulls me in, I really like each fight scene that occurs, especially the ones where Kirito is basically completely overpowering every monster/player. The side stories are pretty good, even though there sides it feels like they play a big role in the main story in terms of character development. Each time there's a romance development between Asuna and Kirito I get really excited, they haven't really done much yet but I really want them to be together they work so well together =P. Its kinda similar to the feeling i get when Touma and Misaka from To Aru Majutsu no Index have romance developments xD.I can't really comment on the Main story yet as it hasn't actually started yet =/
Overall 9 
Currently I am absolutely loving SAO mainly because of the fact that its an anime about an MMORPG =P, it has everything that you can ask for from a fantasy action adventure anime. I think everything is done to a high standard, and theres not much you can ask for except maybe less time leaps and more character development but the anime just started so theres not much i can ask for. This is the view point of someone who hasn't read the light novel so i can't really compare the 2, but I heard that the anime doesn't follow the light novel completely or leaves little bits out? who knows even without reading the light novel i think this is still pretty good. Hopefully with episodes about the main story starting soon SAO will become even better and maybe become of those unforgettable animes such as Clannad or Code Geass.",9
"
                Have you ever played an MMORPG? Sat down in front of your computer, logged into a virtual world, and then realize that the next time you got up from your seat was 5 hours later?
If you ever had this kind of experience, I can say with 90% certainty that you will enjoy SAO. On the other hand, if you have had little experience with online games, you may not be able to truly appreciate SAO.
-Story: 9/10 -
When I completed the first arc - Aincrad, SAO was still ongoing. Unable to wait, I went ahead and read the entires series by Reki Kawahara. On the basis
                  that the anime is directly adapted from the light novel series, I can only say that the story is excellent. From start to end, SAO is able to capture the best elements of MMOs(leveling, questing, guild-forming, raids etc), and combine it with a realistic and entrancing vision of a futuristic game based in the floating castle Aincrad. With regards to the adaptation itself, Aniplex is able to piece together the main plot as well as the SAO side stories to give a reasonable chronological recount of the events that transpired in Aincrad. Of course, the adaptation has its flaws, mainly with respect to the development of the relationship between the two main characters.
Alfheim Online, the second arc, brings the perspective back to the real world and is an excellent follow up to the first arc. 
-Art: 10/10-
The art stays true to the style shown in the light novel series. The coloring is done in a very satisfactory fashion that does justice to the vibrance of the virtual world. The lines may be over-simplistic but then that can be easily overlooked as an aspect of anime itself. In terms of animation, there is no sign of having too many stills that give a 'cheap' feeling to some other series, and the action sequences are very captivating.
-Sound: 10/10-
The voice-acting is good, although I sometimes feel that the protaganist's voice is overly soft and calm at times. The prolonged battle cries in certain scenes may also be slightly exaggerated, but that is indeed the way it was depicted in the light novel, with the multitude of ""Uwa-ah-ah-ah!""s' and such.
-Character: 6/10-
As I mentioned above, the length of the anime is far too short to flesh out the characters. Especially with the inclusion of basically all the Aincrad side-stories, the love-story in the light novel that Aniplex had hoped to bring out in the animation had gone awry, and indeed does not feel right as many others have already said. With the conclusion of these two animated arcs there is also a justifiable feeling that the main character seems like a deux-ex-machina with not enough human qualities. To me, though, this is still better than the psychologically insecure/self-deprecating/extreme-sociopath/extreme-chauvinistic main characters in other animes that I will not name.
-Overall: 9-
At the end of the day, even though I knew exactly what is going to happen having read the light novel, I was still able to finish all 11 episodes of the second arc in one sitting. My advice if you are planning to watch the anime is to just enjoy the action sequences and the vibrant virtual game worlds, and not to expect too much in the way of character development. If at that point of time, you are still able to enjoy SAO, then I highly recommend the light novel series by Reki Kawahara.",9
"
                A genre of a RPG/MMPORG seems pretty okay. Driving this in media is pretty fine. It sounded pretty absurd, how about that? When I heard about SAO, I thought it sounded pretty good because it had to with a video game. But, the first episode was pretty boring in my opinion. It really didn't excite me. I was disappointed, very. The fog of this, I didn't drop the anime because a lot of anime are like that. Boring, but then they get better. It's hard to explain what I felt after watching some more episodes. My despise started, that's how I can describe in this
                  sense. And it's because of the way it was rushed into episode 2. Horrible and not absurd, but when an anime starts out absurd: I like it. Because it's illogical at first, but then logic comes. SAO is not anything like that in my opinion. It's pretty much nothing after the first episode. Here is my reasoning right here, SAO did not come to it's full potential. It had a lot, despite some boring parts and episodes. Yet, I'm going more solely based on another thing. But, first the reasons of my ''absurd'' logic. 
I didn't like the rushing of the anime, I've said that above. And here are some things. Kirito and Asuna got married pretty quickly, and basically I say they fell in love in rush mode, they fell in love pretty fast. What I thought the anime was going to be like was a bad-ass action-adventure with a great plot. But, SAO didn't have any of that. The action was stale, not much adventure in it, and no great plot well because it was very rushed into. Besides the dumb romance, all this makes no sense in the anime because they could just fall in love slowly. Still, it was horrible to put the romance in it. It was not the character's fault. It was the creator's fault for this. I would never blame an anime character or any other character for such fathom. And the next it that it rushes the fights pretty quick if you think about it. 
The anime is very predictable. Kirito and Oberon are the worst parts, when they en guarde. At that time, Kirito had the ability to erase him, but he didn't. He just battled him. That's pretty dumb. But, it's pretty mutual that Kirito had that ability. He basically just wanted revenge. Episode 24 was the worst episode in my opinion. And Kirito and the GM, very many people would agree. And I do too. What the heck. But, the plot-holes are worst.  
Kayaba Akihiko didn't cover all the plot holes. The GM plot as I mentioned, was horrible. 31/10/2022[SAO game comes out] >forward to Episode 4, it's 24/02/2024. And on episode 2, they should have not survived if they had no food nor water. They should be dead! GM plot sucks. SAO is very BS.  Not to be rude to the fans or anything. 
I hope you liked it and thanks for reading.",4
"
                This quite possibly the most insulting Animé I've ever watched, and I've watched a fair few in my days.  But lets start out with the good stuff, the art direction and sound direction is really good, while it doesn't look amazing I have not once felt like any of it was immersion breaking or out of place for that matter. The animators and the voice actors did a good job one and they keep doing so as the series progress, wich takes us to the things that doesn't.
I will say this, the first episode is great. It's a 9/10. Good Pacing, it's funny when
                  it needs to be funny and it introduces a very intresteing concept for an anime and it really captures the feeling of a MMO. Sadly however they had to go and make more episodes. Straight of the bat the second episode destroys any kind of tention set up in the first one, apparently beating levels in this game is something you do off-screen and you do so at an extremly rapid pace and then the characters hit us.
This is a 14 year olds wet dream, being a god in a MMO picking up chicks right, left and center. It's as if they were created by someone that really hates games and gamers, it's a parody of what gamers wish they could be. 
The main character is socialy akward, introvert and does not like taking up alot of space, while in real life these would by most be called shy or if by some mean-spirited person, Anti-social. 
How does this anime portray these character traits? It means you're a badass loner, an enigma to the girls and the envy of the boys. The reason he doesn't join groups and guilds isn't because he has a hard time forming social relationships, it's because he is so good at the game that he doesn't need to. 
So basicly what you have a is a superman, badass loner with a softside saving damsels in distress... And he does so in zones he is way to high level to be in.  
For those that doesn't know, this is an episodical Anime, there is no overacring plot but each week our superbadass mega ultra hero, gets a new girl that he has to save, and she will turn out to pretty much fall for him everytime. He is so overleveled for the zones that he runs around in that even 100 people fit to be in that zone would probably have a really hard time bringing him down. And because of the implications of a mmo, it's very lucky for our hero that everyone was forced to look like their real life selves in game, or one of the many many girls he tries to white knight in this series could have turned out to be 45 year old man, and we can't have that. 
That is all this anime is a glorfied wet dream in a 14 year old boys head. 
This series had so much potential, but it wasted it away on  pandering what people that don't play games, thinks gamers want to be like. 
This anime has managed to insult me not only as anime audience, but as a gamer and a man aswell. 
All in all, really great first episode but on a whole a very bad anime. Someone wrote down the wet dreams he had during puberty and made them into a Anime.",3

                Now I know you will take one look at the score I have given it and will automatically think ""this is just gonna be another hater review. *ignores review* or *clicks not helpful* Just read the next paragraph. If you agree with it, read a bit more and if you get bored then you can leave. If you don't agree then click not helpful and get on with your life.
If my hunch is right, then at least 50% of the anime community are also gamers. And I bet every single one of them has gotten into some sort of mmorpg before. I have. So I
                  can say safely that most of the anime community can relate to Kirito. And Kirito is literally, the perfect gamer. He is not obese, does not live in his mothers basement (I am just pointing out stereotypes sorry if I offend anybody), great at gaming and can pick up chicks in game like they are pokemon. And that people, is how this show hooked so many people.  By making a male lead the viewers dream life that is actually somewhat realistic.
Going more into the review now. What makes this show that makes haters hate so much yet makes people love it so much. I'm just gonna give some major points now.
The Good:
-Great Action
-Amazing art and sound
-The amazing world of SAO
-The ""Romance""
The Bad:
-The Characters
-The Timeskips
-Progression of story does not do what it says on the tin
-The ""Romance""
As I do my review I will try to cover and explain all these points. And remember, this is all personal opinion. Don't rage or anything if you're reading this.
Story-5
Everybody in the anime community know the story. I don't need to explain it. At first glance the story seems fine. But after the first 2 episodes, everything goes downhill. From episode 2 to 3, there is massive timeskip. Everybody is level 20-ish more and Kirito is double their level. When I watched this questions aroused like ""How is Kirito double their level?"" or ""Was there anything important that happened on the other floors?"". But that is one timeskip in a pool of many. The other big problem I found was that the story set itself up as some grand quest and struggle for survival in the first 2 episodes. After that, all I saw was Kirito helping out some girls then getting married and focusing on his love life for the rest of the SAO arc. Call me blind if you must, but I think I am not the only one with that opinion. Then we have the Alfheim arc (I think I spelled it right). Long story short. It was shit. I barely understood what was the point in making that arc. There was no danger to it anymore. I could rant for a lot longer but I will stop now. Hopefully you get my message about both arcs.
Art-10
This probably doesn't deserve a perfect score. But I will cut it some slack. Not to say it was bad or anything, quite the opposite. The character designs (except for Suguha) were really well drawn, the world of SAO and to a lesser extent Alfheim online looks amazing, the action scenes were well choreographed and the boss battles always had me cheering ""Haul some ass guys!!!!"". I'm 100% sure that 50% of the anime community knows about the awsome art and animation of SAO. And I will say, it lives up to it's hype.
Sound-8
I don't remember much about the sound. Not because it sounds bad but it has been a while since I watched this and I don't plan on re-watching this or watching the second season. But the biggest question that comes in my mind when I think about sound or more specifically music in SAO is ""Does Crossing Field by LiSA live up to it's hype?"" Yes it's really good, but it's a little overhyped. (Personal opinion if you disagree with it; good for you, have a cookie.) That is all I can say about the sound because I don't remember any of the ED's or the other OP and I can't remember the background music.
Character-4
Now this is the part of SAO that I find really falls flat on it's face. Kirito is literally just one of those big face cut-out things that you put your face in. He is the perfect character and that is all we see him as. Then we have Asuna. She first appeared as some badass heroine but turned into a ""damsel in distress"" character and was completely useless later on without Kirito around. I found no character development within the series. I will give this anime the trophy for maybe the first to have ""character regression"" as in the opposite of character development. There was ""romantic"" development but I also found it so forced and rushed. I'm sorry people but I had to say it. This ""shining"" point in this series is what I found one of the worst. What I saw was a really stereotypical or more accurately a generic love story. Boy meets girl, they hang out, go on a ""date"", then they get married...wut? I can rant about this forever. But I think I made my point. Wait I forgot some characters. Suguha: incest is not wincest. The other two girls in Kirito's harem: they only appeared in 2 episodes. Cant say much other than they are useless without Kirito around.
Enjoyment-4
I'll be honest. As terrible as I am making this sound. (And I probably did switch o pure hater review some time along the way) I did enjoy it to an extent. There was only 4-ish episodes that did not involve anybody swinging a sword at some type of boss, and those 4-ish episodes were the really terrible ones. The other episodes were worth watching for the epic boss fights or any sort of duel that happened. Now this does not include the Alfheim arc. If I were to rate the SAO ar and Alfheim arc then SAO would get a 6 while Alfheim gets a 1. Alfheim was just mind-numbingly pointless. If you want to know my thoughts, then google ""problems with SAO second half"" then click on any blog and read the hate comments. Those are my thoughts.
Overall-4
Obviously you might be thinking ""the scores don't add up. A 5, 10, 8 and two 4's shouldn't get a medium of 4."" And yes it should be something like a 5 or 6. What's stopping it. All the scores was mostly based on SAO. This score and the last also included Alfheim. Which severely brought it down. I'll be honest. The studio could have just extended the SAO arc to all 25 episodes. Then that could have made for a lot less timeskips, and perhaps actually fleshed out the characters. But apparently the manga got cut halfway through so they cut the SAO arc short  just threw in the Alfheim arc. I don't know if this is true, I have checked but didn't get any answers.",4
"
                tl;dr The entire problem with SAO is the adaptation. They are rushing through this far too quickly, which results in this being a pretty bad series. I hope they find their stride and recover after a time.
EDIT: For some reason the review is still showing me at 1 of ?. I'm currently caught up.
STORY (6): Solid story, but the details aren't being developed very well. There's very little world building, and I'm left to assumed that the things they pull out of nowhere are actual components of this world. It doesn't draw me in on any level more than a basic fight-for-survival story, and even
                  that it does poorly thanks to Character.
CHARACTER (5): The director and writer seriously have no idea what they are doing. Killing off a character and then spending the rest of the episode trying to make me feel bad about it isn't the effective way to go about things. The character development is very poorly timed and lacking when it does show up.
ART (8): Good, but nothing spectacular. No Fate/zero.
SOUND (8): Good, but nothing spectacular.
ENJOYMENT: (6) It looks cool, sounds cool, but fails at the ultimate task of drawing me in and experiencing the world with the characters. I really don't feel the drama and emotion they are trying to make me feel, which is entirely due to the poor pacing.",5

                Ya there!
This is my first time reviewing and the scoring is personal. So it's not surprising if your score with mine is different. By the way my english is not that good either so I hope you understand that. Well, whatever..
So here it goes!
SAO(aka Sword Art Online) one of the most loved and hated at the same times in 2012 era. With that being said, SAO is actually not that bad or at least not as bad as the haters said, BUT SAO is without a doubt is not as great as people said either. 
Why?
Let's talk about it here.
-STORY- (6)
We have our main character(Kirigaya
                  Kazuto aka Kirito) one of the few beta tester(which is not really important soon) play and then trapped in a game called SAO. And then the game creator said that the player must clear the 100th floor and defeat the final boss on the game to survive, with dying on the game lead you to death in the real world.
The concept of the story is great and the potential for this anime to be a great and unique anime is huge, but the execution of it for the rest of the episodes is bad. The most disappointed part of the story(for me) is that the author is not making use of the concept effectively, instead the author end up make a cheap romance relationship with a few shown development.
But I believe it's totally decent for most viewers. It's not great doesn't mean it's bad.
So give it a try folks.
-ART-(7.6)
I don't find the art unique, it's great and the animation is fluid but that's all. Most anime nowadays is better or as good as SAO. 
Though with that being said the art fit the anime greatly.
-SOUND-(7)
As for the Sound, I just personally don't like the OP and ED so I give it 7.
It's OST is great though, as you can expect from Yuki Kajiura.
I don't know many voice actor but they're doing good.
It's probably 8 for most people.
-CHARACTERS-(4)
This is the worst part of SAO for me. I'm quite sensitive when it's about character development, so it won't be surprising if I 'kind-of-insult' it a bit.
I don't understand for people who's saying that SAO's character is deep. The story is rushing too much at some point, so there's no space for character development. All we know is that:
Kirito go help many people.
Kirito Lvl up without any process.
Kirito got the ideal girl(and harem) easily.
Most female characters fall for Kirito without any realistic reason.
I'll begin with our MC first.
Kirito's development is the most poor one. He's like totally created to be the ideal form of guy without any process, and that's the worst way to use main character effectively.
Asuna's development is poor too. At first she's a cool solo beautiful female character, but end up becoming a 'easy to get' girl and totally weak character, and again it's happening because lack of character development. what a let down. 
I personally find Suguha(2nd arc)'s development is the most decent one. but again with a few development close to none Suguha's arc(ALO) is looks so stupid to me.
As for the other characters. Most of them show in each episode related to them and then thrown as if their purpose is to show how badass Kirito is.
So I end up don't remember the other characters anymore.
That should've been a strong prove enough to show that SAO's character development is poor here.
-ENJOYMENT-(5)
I personally don't enjoy SAO.
But I think SAO's quite enjoyable actually, only if you don't think the depth of it that is.
-OVERALL-(6.4)
SAO's not that bad, actually it's good. It's just disappointing that a great potential anime is poorly written.
So, there're few problems why SAO is disappointing for me:
It's concept is great but not used effectively.
The character development(again) is so poor.
The Author is throwing too many female character that was end up fall for Kirito which leads to harem-ish condition.
If you seek a easy to understand and not so in depth story with a great animation. SAO's a good choice without a doubt. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So,I believe it's not hurt for you people to give it a try.
it's worth watching.",6
"
                When i first heard about SAO I thought this series has great potential and could be reall enjoyable. Soo i went on to watch the first couple of episodes, they were actually great and gave a good introduction as too what was expected of the show. The series even had an awesome female lead with great combat skills. 
However, thats where the enjoyment stopped. From then on the show just went down hill and gave you your basic OP guys with tons of chicks falling for him, and this includes the lead girl. There was no chaacter development and hardly any fights with the bosses
                  they needed to defeat on each level, leading to me being very dissapointed. I expected this to be a great series in which it was a fight for survival, defeating each boss as they came. This unfortunately was the complete opposite. 
Without giving too many spoliers I will just say, if your looking for an awesome fighting series to watch then don't bother with this. This series is mainly a haram romance and some fighting sequences, that come across quite boring and short. Your main character is very 1 dimentional and bland. You also never really see the dire need for their survial with the characters. It sometimes looks like they are contempt with their situation. Hence the lack of fight scenes with the bosses. 
Overall the series was a major dissappointment. And I dont even want to get started on how the other half of the episodes went.",3
"
                I haven't been updating my MAL for quite some time, but this series deserves it.
I rated it (1) because while the first arc was pretty bad, this second arc has become quite truthfully ""unwatchable"". 
Story: Good original concept, has taken a huge nosedive though. To the point that it no longer is a real story so much as just a stage to play out preteen fantasies. Its quite embarasing, and it strongly reeks of the ""chuunibiyo/eight grader syndrome"". You have a hero who is super special and always has a super advantage with his super equipment and never loses because he has super special abilities.
                  It's cringe worthy. As for this arcs damsel in distress direction, it isn't the worst plot but it is a cliche of cliches.
Characters: When I first started watching this show, I thought ""Okay, we have some asocial kid here, but through trials and turbulations he will develop as a character, etc"". Not quite what happened. He just suddenly became outgoing and talkative.
The art and the sound are average.
This series was thoroughly unenjoyable and I recommend it to anyone with poor taste.",1
"
                P.S (Pre-Scriptum): In general I don't write anime reviews. Actually, I don't write any at all, but something about the reception that this release has received so suddenly brings it to my attention, and not in a good way.
Story (8): The story and premise in general are very good and in fact unique, it leaves a lot of room for expansion and opportunity and also draws in the audience. The protagonist is a teenage boy who beta tests and becomes immersed in a new MMORPG release titled ""Sword Art Online"" (SAO). The scene is in the future where video game technology has progressed with new
                  hardware called ""nervegear"" a physical attachment that allows players to become fully physically immersed into the video game, allowing for more realistic combat, interactions, etc. All well and good. So far at least. The first 10,000 players that receive the release are trapped inside by the ominous game-maker who states that leaving and/or dying within the game results in a real life death for the player, and that the only way to escape is to complete the game by clearing all 100 floors of Aincrad, the main MMO city, and beating the final boss. You would think that in the future where such video game production quality is available that a designer could come up with a better game progression system than a layered dungeon. Come on.
Art (7): Not much much to say in this respect. Lots of vibrant colors and a good landscape design for the world of Aincrad. The art is pretty standard and similar to that of other releases currently.
Sound (6): Here's where I can be a bit picky. The BGM is okay, nothing that stands out, and the OP/EDs are the typical boring upbeat Jpop bullshit. Been there done that. I just wish that every anime could have great OP/EDs like Tatami Galaxy, Gurren Lagann, Zetsubou Sensei, to name a few.
Character (3): This is where the entire anime falls in quality. The main character is un-relatable, lacks emotion, and is just good at everything and lacks any physical or mental flaws. The writing also makes his decision making hard to understand and leaves the audience bored. He meets another player, who is magically the most beautiful and skilled and has about as much to say or do as Bella from Twilight. Nothing. Then you have the actions of the rest of the players. You would think that with your life on the line you would at least try to stay alive, but no. The leader of their first expedition to the first floor decides to throw his life away for no discernible reason, when he was offered the choice to survive at no cost, he instead chooses to give up his entire life, worth, and meaning. Great job writers, great job. Then the main character after being named a hero and all that shit, turns into a huge dick and sneers at the rest of the players, declaring his dominance and their inferiority. He goes on to talk about how he is a cheater and a hacker (with no evidence to back it up). And goes out strutting his pompous ass, without a single explanation or care from the writers.
Enjoyment (7): As with all shounen/action genre releases, the anime is well paced and won't leave you hanging at drawn-out slow bits, but the enjoyment of the action is broken with consistent contradictions and more plot holes than you could count.
Overall (5): With such a quick growth of fans and 10/10 ratings/reviews, you would expect more from this release, but that is something an intelligent viewer just can't do. Many would just take a look at the surface art/story premise and call it good, but few would take the moments to delve into the behaviors of the characters and the shape of the story, to see where all of the great issues lie. And these issues spoil any enjoyment that you can find in this candy-coated money sink production called ""Sword Art Online"". Even with only viewing the first 3 episodes, I have little hope for the future of this anime, as I can see little opportunity or skill that the writing staff could use to save this imminent train wreck.
Please don't take my review too harshly or critical (although it very well may be that!), keep in mind that I have only seen the first 3 episodes and am coming into this viewing with an open mind and neutral observations. I am not doing this to spite anyone, I just find it funny that people are so quick to praise this, and I would like to offer contradictory evidence.
Thank you for your time.",5

                Sword Art Online reviews on this website are a dime a dozen on this website now a days, but screw it... here goes nothing
What is good about it? The animation is very colorful and nice to look at. The first little bit of Sword introduces us to modern day Japan, which gave me a feeling of dread in the color pallets that were used, maybe  because the colors in the beginning were real dull to symbolize how dull and heartless the world is sometimes. Once Kirito enters the realm of Aindecrad (or however you spell it ) we are introduced to vibrant colors that
                  stay consistent through the series. Aindcrad is the kind of world in an anime that i wouldn't mind living in. There are scenes in episodes 7-9 or something like that (its been a while since i have seen this show) where Kirito and a significant other find serenity via a log cabin, by the lake, by a water fall, full of wildlife, in the middle of nowhere, on floor 22 (maybe). That sort of place is the kind of place i could retire and die happy living in. 
The music in Sword Art Online is easily the best thing about the series (aside from the Kirito, Assuna Sub-arc) which is done by Yuki Kajiura. As good as Yuki's music is, i cant help that she has had the shit end of the stick as far as composing music for terrible anime goes (yes including this one), but i can happily say that she also did the music for a much Superior series than this one series, Fate/Zero.
You can probably guess from the score of this review where this is going. Whats wrong with the show?
Sword Art Online features an amazing premise. A TV that puts the main characters into a real life MMORPG Death game! You'd think that would make for some real good television right? WRONG! Every anime I've seen has done it wrong so far (no I haven't seen Log Horizon yet). With the exception of the Kirito x Asuna Arc, the story is fruitless, and full of stupid things that happen because the plot demanded it to happen, without trying to be subtle about it. I can't put my finger on how and why this show became such a bore as well. The random stories that happen through the massive time skip try to be interesting and different in a series like this, but a lot of things beyond those are a real bore, even the fight scenes sometimes. I mentioned that the animation was good in this show, but to a certain extent. The animation for the fight scenes are overly flashy and after a while, felt all too family from the fight scene before it. But undoubtedly the most boring thing about this show is the second half. It's nice that the episodes are featuring actual continuity finally, but was there any point? The show's second half was void of almost any plot and was downright dreadful to watch. I had a hard time keeping myself awake when i powered through the last 13 episodes in that one after noon, and this is coming from someone who stayed awake til 2am powering through the nauseatingly fast paced show, Kill La Kill,. As boring as that was, it still wasn't as boring as .hack/Sign, which is also a show about an RPG Death Game (you don't need to watch that show either.
How is the protagonist? Kirito is an awful protagonist. There were 10,000 people in Sword Art Online that got trapped in Aindrad and they chose Kirito to revolve around. Kirito lacks personality, and is way too overpowered of a character. "">But Gaddafi he's powerful because he grinded his skills hard and went on dungeon raids and maxed out his skills because he's so good at MMOs."" I find it hard to believe in a game genre that encourages team play, because of how insanely hard raids and progression in MMOs can be, that he by himself became a level, that him so powerful that his health regenerates faster than he takes damage, without dying, in episode 3, on floor 15? They could have at least made it believable. What is with girls hitting on Kirito all the time? I could understand an anime character like Kamina from Gurren Lagann getting all the girls, but Kirito looks like a little turd and acts super emo all the time.
My biggest beef with this series in the way that it is structured. Before this series was an anime, it was a first a light novel. As far as I know, the Ancrade Arc, the first 12 or 13 episodes of the series were written in two books. One was the main *cough* story arc, and the second was a book that featured a bunch of random stories that happens between the ridiculuos time skips that happen early in the first arc. Instead of only having the random story episodes happen in OVA episodes, and the actually story arc take place in the main series, they tried to squish both novels into the first 12 episodes and it doesn't work at all. Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex does the same idea, where Stand Alone Episodes exist between main story episodes, none of the Stand Alone episodes even make an attempt to have relevance to the overarching plot line or tie into it somehow. And that is just the first half..... The second half is utterly pointless perverted, it drags out for way too long, and serves as an excuse for make the series painfully longer.
The worst of all, by the way, is the amount of exposition in the show. Exposition isn't bad, as long as it is done in a way that keeps the viewer interested; characters sitting at a cafe talking is NOT interesting by any means. I think i counted at least 10 times that they sat at a cafe, or cafe like scenario to deliver exposition. One of my friends took a screenwriting course, and was telling him about, and he said that: one of the first things they teach you, is that delivering exposition via sitting at a coffee table, cafe whatever is unacceptable in screen writing. I saw the first episode of SAO2, and that was exactly what turned me off to watching the second series. They didn't learn anything from this mess of a show. The first episode featured exposition that made up of 13-22 minutes of its run time. That's enough Sword Are Online for me. 
The ending made me upset as well.
I give the first half a 4/10, 
while i give the second half a 1/10
I give it 2 tentacle rape scenes out of 10 naked girls on Kirito's bed chambers
You don't need to see this show.",2
"
                It's the prime example of a series that gets worse and worse with each episode and that's pretty much the worst thing that can happen in an anime. It's one thing if there's no real story or character development(Fairy Tail), but dragging down a interesting premise so far seems almost intentional.
It's easier to list the good aspects about SAO than the bad and pretty much the only thing that's legitimately good about it is it's premise and initially the setting. Which isn't an achievement because anyone with half a brain could've come up with these. But who could explain it better than the author himself?(everything
                  of the following is obvously fictional and contains spoilers, if you just want to see the ratings skip it):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
He probably thought:
""Hey, i'm completely incapable of creating believable characters or a proper story, sticking to a theme and yeah, if i'm honest i also suck pretty much anything else, how can i still make a popular anime without having to work? Oh, i could target the 10-15 year old boys who don't care about all that. If i make an anime about MMO's they'll love it no matter what.""
So he went to his producer who said:""Yeah, great idea, catering to the lowest common dominator is and always will be the best way to make fast money. You'll get far, son!""
Then the author teamed up with some other people and they started fleshing out the story.
Steve:""I think we should focus on the emotions and struggles of the main characters in such a frightening world and the dark aspects of humanity when everything just comes down to surviving. An MMO setting also allows for ridicoulus character development and interesting enemies and fights like they've never done before.""
Author:""Shut up, Steve, you fucking dumbass. Our viewers don't care for that shit. We'll make the MC a weak kid who becomes overpowered as fuck in just two episodes. That's what i call character development, bitch. Kirito is just there for our viewers to insert themself into to fulfill their wishes of power. The female MC only exists to support him. I know our viewers have various fetishes- like the tsundere or the weak girl who needs to be protected- and she's there to fulfill them all. That's what i call a deep character.""
Steve(crying, leaving the room):""...""
Author:""So, now that the loser is gone: Someone wants to go bowling?""
Greg:""Shouldn't we finish the anime first?""
Author:""Why are you always such a fun killer. Alright Mr. Tryhard, design some fillers, then i'll be back later to design the last episode of the first season where everything of the main story happens.""
On the next day.
Author:""Guys... i drank to much last night. I know we're only around the half of the anime, but let's just end it here, i need to go to sleep.""
Greg:""The motives of the villain are still missing.""
Author:""Let's just say he forgot all of his motives. It's because he was so absorbed from the world he created he doesn't care for things like ""motives"". That's some deep shit.""
Greg:""I just think you're a lazy fuck, i'm out.""
So at the end of season one the author was alone because he fired all of the people who criticized him. But he met his only goal, he got tha $$$ from the kids. But now he's fucked, with absolutely no ideas how to fill the other half of the series.
""Hmm i could do just the same thing again. But now the protagonists have long ears, that should be enough of a difference. There's also a nice underused trope i've heared of called ""damsel in distress"". That should be enough of a story. I hate the people who criticized me. How can i annoy them even more, how can i strap my series of the last good thing it has going for it? Oh, the fear of dying. Now it's just a normal game.""
I could go further because i haven't even called out the worst what's going to happen but i have to stop here. The second season is just a train-wreck and pushes the weaknesses of the first half to the limit. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know all this sounded sarcastic, bitter and mean. But i think if you can count yourself to the target audience(10-15 year old boys), you can have a lot of fun with the first season, but you should stop there. Note that compared to other people who's rating system is: 10- great/9-many flaws/ 8-average/7-shit/6-0 - doesn't exist, 5 really means average for me. 
Story: 
Already explained, interesting premise ruined as much as possible. 14 episodes were already too little for a proper story in this setting and more than half of them are fillers. Until episode 14 i would've given it a 6 or 7/10. Slightly above average and enjoyable. But in episode 14 we see that the author put absolutely no thought into the story. 3/10 for the first season. 1/10 for the second.
Art: 
high production value but that's it, there's nothing more to it, it just looks pretty. If shows like Monogatari or Mononoke are 9 or 10/10. There's no way this is more than 6/10, probably 7/10 if i'm fair.
Sound: 6/10, but to be fair i can't think of an anime with a high production value that has bad music. 
Characters: 2/10 
because some minor characters are interesting. But you can't rate the mc's higher than 1. I don't think overpowered characters are bad in general, but i don't know what the author was thinking to put an extremely overpowered main character in a setting that is all about surviving. That's like putting Alucard in Pokemon to become Ash's new companion.
Enjoyment: 
4/10. I would lie if i said i had no fun watching this. If you can see past the flaws, turn your brain of and watching it with the mind of a young teenager, the first season is mostly 8/10 until episode 14(which is 1/10). Second season probably 2/10 because i had absolutely no expectations anymore and sometimes got surprised by the smallest good things. if you combine the two seasons i think 4/10 is fair.
Overall: 
It's unfair to criticize shonen because they don't touch adult themes, don't have deep, meaningful conversations or are loaded with symbolism. However the premise of this show is clearly very seinen. And it's completely fair to criticize shonen for their terrible storylines and characters, some of the best stories like TTGL or FMA:B are shonen.
Objectively it's a train wreck that even fails at it strengths. Who needs the million possible ways of power a character is able to have in an MMO, dual-wielding is the best and most unique ability! /s
If you want an action packed shonen anime, i would recommend anything over SAO, even Fairy Tail or Naruto, because at least they stick to their themes and hilariously enough their characters seem deeper than the Mariana Trench compared to SAO.
If you ever wanted to live in an MMO(which most people who played them thought about), it might be worth a watch. Mainly because there's currently no competition for this kind of anime and the author banked on that, sadly with success. It's unbelievable that this series has an average score of 8.3. People who liked it only liked it because of the setting and didn't care for anything else. I can get it if people give it a high ""enjoyment"" rating, but if you are rating the characters and the story with more than 3/10 you seriously need to watch other shows.
So, if you are a 10-15 year old boy with no girlfriend who dreams of living in an MMO, you've found a 10/10 anime for you(and i really don't mean this insulting, i wish i could've watched this anime 10 years ago). For anyone else- don't watch it. I'm giving it a 3/10 because i'm a huge fan of mmo's, action and nice graphics. If you don't value these three very high, it's nothing but an 1/10, maybe 2/10 for the looks.",3

Klive is one of the pedos who thinks Kerrytu is rlly kawaii. 
Big Robe Guy Ahikro is the bad guy in the story. He looks pretty lame to be honest...
Art: The title has art in it, so obv it's good lol o__O/ but rilly it's pretty anime and good.
Sounds: There weren't many sound but from what i herad they was pretty good and fitted the mood realy well.
Overalls: 10/10, good anime, another great anime from Kishumuto, great job guy.",10

                Disclaimer: This is my first review, so I'm not entirely sure how to do it, and although I'll try to avoid it in the future,  I feel the need to talk about spoiler material in this one, so be warned. Also, there will be a TL;DR if you want to skip.
First of all, the biggest problem with SAO is all the potential it wasted, it had good concepts, art and acting, but the story itself was a bad application of the good ideas, while the protagonist and his love interest were annoying and forgettable respectively and all the other characters that could have been
                  interesting pass by without development or even much screen time, instead feeling as tools to advance the plot (technically every character and event in a fiction is this, but they shouldn't feel like they are just this, that's my point)
I'll explain it in more detail later on, but for now I'll talk about the small details, from this point on there will be spoilers.
My first problem with the show started right on the first episode, I'll try to be brief on this one. The microwave explanation for the nerve gear made no sense, and why would people be so willing to put a death machine in their heads? Then there's the actual game, a game with no mages or ranged classes would not be that popular (I admit, this one is a total nitpick, but it still annoys me), then there's ""resources in an MMO are limited that's why I'll use my beta tester knowledge to go to good places to level up"" talk, it was bad both because it made no sense and because the protagonist I should side with already started like an unlikable jerk.
After that it was pretty much a bunch of forgettable episodes that didn't really advance the plot and were just trying to give the protagonist some pseudo-character development, but it's not character development if the events don't add to your character, he kept shifting between attitudes all the time with no real solid character traits.
The aspects of this taking place inside a game were also really thrown at you with no care about the presentation, with inconsistencies like sometimes they feel pain and sometimes they don't, or how in the first episode and a lot of times they activated the skills by will but for some occasions they had to access the menu to use some and so goes, it felt like this anime was just thinking any reference is good because people will automatically relate to it.
Now for the supporting cast, they were all there to highlight how awesome the ""hero"" supposedly was, that's really just it, even the love interest was forgettable. The first villain's actions were also questionable, saying he wanted his own world to watch, but trapping himself as a player too with the death rule applying to himself, or even the need to kill people if he could just trap them there, especially when later he wasn't portrayed as a really evil guy, just one crazy idiot.
Now for the second part of the series, the second villain made much more sense, but was too forgettable, just your typical power-hungry lunatic. The plot started making even less sense from this point on, there had just been a huge tragedy about a virtual reality game and then people immediately go play another one, including the main character's sister, he almost died there and spent years trapped, what is the logical course of action for his sister? PLAY THE SAME TYPE OF GAME FOR NO REASON WHEN FLASHBACKS SHOWED SHE WASN'T EVEN REALLY INTO GAMES TO BEGIN WITH, she was there just for the sake of being a plot device.
The side-characters and ""people"" of this world are simply retarded, just think about it, would you act like they did if you were trapped in a virtual reality that could kill you? Would you simply go and play a new one after such an event had just ended? You wouldn't.
There is much more to criticize about this one, but I'll leave it as is because this is already too long.
TL;DR: The protagonist is an idiot with no real character traits to him, but treated as awesome, all the side characters are merely tools for the plot and highlighting the hero, everyone in this world acts like a moron, the plot was an awful application of good concepts and the show is full of small details inconsistencies to big-time errors that completely ruin immersion.
The animation is good and so is the acting, but that is not nearly good enough to save this show.",2
"
                An anime is huge potential, an excellent premise ruined by poor execution. They diluted the plot with shallow and redundant romance. Every single character in the show is one dimensional, the main character is a Mary Sue and has more plot armor than the millennium falcon.
Despite people claiming this is one of the best anime ever made, i really have to wonder if this was the first anime they ever watch. 5 for average.
              ",5
"
                Final Verdict:(11/8/2012)
I tried, I really tried. Unfortunately, the characters again took a downswing and stayed on that downhill path. The animation took a small hit because of the lack of focus on the battle scenes (hello, an action anime should have lengthy, quality fighting scenes), and the story failed to break past the ""fair"" barrier. 
My patience was truly tested with this show. With a cop-out ending to the first season and an even more terrible start to the second, I cannot find myself continuing this series. There are far better shows currently airing, and unfortunately, SAO fails to make a cut. 
Dropped Policy score:
                  5/10. 
I've been reading the myriad of reviews popping up about this anime, and I have been watching each new episode as it comes out to see how it goes. I've noticed this show has either received extraordinarily positive reception or has been deemed expendable. I am going to try to find the mid-ground in this premature review. (btw i'm going to use the character's in-game name instead of their full real names)
IMPORTANT NOTE: I will repeat this again at the end, but keep in mind, I am reviewing the anime adaptation of Sword Art Online, not the original light novel. I am sure that many who have read the light novel with disagree about my premature opinions, but I am reviewing my thoughts on how the anime adaptation is portraying everything to me.
Story:
 Kirito is assumed as an introvert in real life as the story briefly shows him as a shut-in who probably plays video games too much, but the director and others in charge of designing him probably made sure to differentiate him from your average creeper that stays at home all day in his room. The year is 2022, and a new video game has been launched called sword art online. As a highly touted commodity, it is fitting that only 10000 copies were released to the masses. The game requires the Nerve Gear, a futuristic type of gaming ""console"" in the form of a helmet that you wear.  
(This is where it gets spoiler-ish if you don't want to know anything at all before watching it, but it's also the de-facto characteristic that makes the story great)
As he passes a day in this new virtual world, he and his new acquaintance, Klein, figure out that they cannot logout. Controlled chaos ensues as the entire community is amassed into a Colosseum and the creator of the game, Akihiko Kayaba, makes an astonishing announcement. You cannot log out of sword art online. There is but two ways to do so: either beat the game by completing all 100 floors or ""die"" in the game, which will essentially trigger the Nerve Gear (also designed by Kayaba) to fry your brain and actually kill you. The twist to this sadistic MMORPG is what essentially makes the story interesting and worth watching more. Few shows I know of utilize such a twist, and if you were to just take the story itself at face value, it is still an interesting premise that has potential. (albeit it seems to feel rushed more recently) One gripe I do have about the story is that generally, there isn't a sense of urgency that usually accommodates a life or death story. Although you usually feel that when watching the battle scenes, everyday town life seems way too carefree.
Update 9/9:
Again, there's no complaining the concept of the story is unique. Some little RPG-esque nuances are subtly fitted in to increase the enjoyment of the series; however, this story has a huge achilles heel that it rapidly dragging it down: the pacing. I am fully aware that the light novel is ridiculously long and they only have 25 or so episodes to complete the story, but this is still not a valid enough excuse to account for consistent gaffes in the pace of the story. Although everything might feel smooth for a watcher who has read the light novel (or at least has a good amount of background), as a viewer who watches this show with absolutely no background, I am at a complete loss frequently. Still, great concept, enticing story, but blatantly poor execution.
(6/10)-Oh boy has this taken a downswing.
Art:
A-1 pictures has again provided a good consistent quality to its art. The character designs are fitting, and I found it quite comical when (spoiler alert I guess)...they used the mirror and suddenly like 90% of the girl avatars turned into guys (because it revealed their facial identity since the Nerve Gear knows what your face looks like). Although the series is not quite eye candy, some of the settings are beautiful and the animation of the fighting scenes are done relatively well. Although, like most anime, there are some blemishes here or there. For instance, several important animation points are undermined as fluid battles are replaced with shiny lights moving rapidly around still frames to make it appear as if you are watching a high quality piece of work. The character designs are decent too. 
(8/10)-Great quality, sometimes inconsistent
Sound:
Again, like the art, the sound is nothing that would amaze the average viewer. (though i don't have much to back this claim up at this point) The high point of the sound is definitely the opening, crossing field, by LiSA. You can't go wrong by having her do any type of song. The ending, Yume Sekai, by Tomatsu Haruka oddly doesn't fit very well with the whole feel of the series. A relatively calming song, it just doesn't work with the supposed chaotic, fast-paced feel that a life and death type of story should have. 
Final update: There is no doubt the OST is the ray of hope in the package that is sword art online. Composed by Kajiura Yuki, the music, frankly, is on another level compared to the series itself. It's a shame how such good music is often squandered on relatively subpar series. 
(8/10)-Great 
Character:
Unfortunately, nobody can make a good story work out without good characters. Many shows I have watched before (ie: guilty crown) have had its essence nearly torn apart by less than exemplary characters. Although a character like Asuna (main female protagonist) as well as other supporting characters maintain a sound set of characteristics to follow by, the plague of the series is unfortunately, the most important character, Kirito. (Little tidbit of knowledge: Kirito is also one of 1000 beta testers of this game too, so that explains why he's so good at the game)
Kirito is more than just a mystery. Personally, I call him Shu 2.0(guilty crown watchers know what I mean). I really do not care what other people try to say about Kirito that is positive because I simply dismiss it as hogwash up to this point of the series. Some might say he's a complete bada** while others label him a beta male. I would be completely fine if he was one or the other, but the unfortunate news is that he's BOTH...in the SAME episode...TWICE. I apologize if it sounds like i am simply hating on his personality, but he is no different than the infamous Shu. The difference between him as Shu is that Shu can at least portray himself as either the alpha or beta male for a good chunk of time. Unfortunately, in the 3 episodes shown so far, 2 of them show his complete roller coaster of emotions on display. 
(spoiler alert)
In the 2nd episode, he goes from loner, to nice guy, to a sort of dark-misunderstood villain. In the 3rd episode, he suddenly finds friends and gets to know a group really well and opens up(probably the MOST awkward transition i have ever seen. I was questioning whether I skipped an episode, or 5), but then due to unfortunate circumstances, he turns into an angsty crybaby again (while relatively justified). If Kirito wants to win over credibility again, he must choose both his physical and emotional role. He cannot continue this nearly shameful display. However, the positive side of Kirito's character is that when he acts like a bada**, he is a pretty good one. 
Final update: The characters probably couldn't have gotten anymore worse. Asuna's character has been dehumanized to that of a prize rather than the strong independent woman that she was portrayed as in the first 2 episodes. Kirito's ""I can do anything because I'm the best"" character is devoid of any noticeable development. And finally, all of the other characters aren't even noticeable. 
Characters: 3/10
Enjoyment:
To be painstakingly honest, I enjoy this series when I am not trying to ponder the mystery that is Kirito. Since I love the concept of the story and the whole get to the 100th floor and beat the final boss thing, I am able to get a good amount of enjoyment. There are some lighthearted, comical scenes to break a tense mood sometimes, and the progression of this whole ride, although rushed, is enjoyable.
Final update:
Seeing how I can't even get myself to catch up (and dropped it in the end), enjoyment takes a slight hit. The premise was interesting to keep me attached for a while, but I just got bored (yes, even with the mach 5 pacing)
(6/10)-
Overall: (11/8/2012)
The show had all the potential in the world. It started off relatively strong, boasting a great concept; however, it just couldn't hold on to what it promised, and to rub some more salt on the would, the terrible characters didn't help at all either. In the end, as stated above at the top, the show gets my dropped show rating, a 5/10.",5

                When I first read the synopsis for Sword Art Online I was enthralled to see that there was going to be a show that featured video games as a major theme and actually looked promising. Once I began watching this, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. The general premise of this series was great but as that being its only strength it would not standout among the more matured anime viewers. I believe the targeted audience for this anime was teenage gamers, boys to be more specific. The male protagonist is someone that all teenage boys yearn to be; invincible, charismatic, the center of all
                  attention and the prowess to get the girl. I'd say that the writer used this to his advantage to attract a large audience, who doesn't love a hero with the ability to stop anything in his path, right?
The general story-line of Sword Art Online isn't bad, it's just how it was delivered. Locked in a prison of virtual reality where as the only escape is to beat the game without dying or pay the cost of losing your actual life in the process. After the first story arc ended the series took a major turn for the worse. Plot holes became more severe than the regular. A good example of one would be that on several occasions characters would die without actually dying in person. Just the point being of how events would happen without getting an explanation when they were needed was a general theme to SAO.
My favorite part of the series by far was the art and the animation. In the world of Sword Art Online every level of a dungeon had a different theme, ranging from endless fields to frozen waste lands. Just the detail that would be put into these locations would leave you struck in awe. The animation has been some of the best I have seen as well, with fluent motions from the characters I would enjoy the fight scenes with great attention. As for the sound and ambiance of it, I thought that it was well done. Monsters would make sounds that you'd think they'd make and the sound of clashing swords was as realistic as it could be.
As for the character development in this show there was evidently none if barely some at all. The male protagonist stays the same throughout. As for the female protagonist she makes one major change then stays sticks with it for the rest of the series. The villains never seemed to really pose a serious threat to the main character and in that being so I couldn't develop a hate for them, no matter how dastardly they may have been. I noticed on several occasions during the show that there were some really heart wrenching moments but I just couldn't get into them because of the fact that I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters in the scene. I believe if they would have took the time and had an episode or two dedicated to letting the viewer get to know the main characters a little more then perhaps I would have shed a tear or two.
My enjoyment for the series came to its peak during the fight scenes, just that feeling of excitement during a fast paced battle really kept me at the edge of my toes during the whole show. My least favorite part would had to have been when there was an emotional scene solely because I could get into it. I was thrown for a loop on some of the twists and that made me happy but that only happened a few times, besides that, the show was quite predictable and would make an episode boring to watch if I already anticipated what the coming events were to be.
Overall Sword Art Online is not necessarily a bad show, the reason being that this is such a controversial issue is that the series was over hyped leaving incorrigible fans pitted against people that had their hearts set on letting the world know that it isn't as great as people think it is. With that in mind, remember that we watch anime to be entertained, not to fight about which is better or worse. In conclusion I would like to state what I believe to be the worst and best points of the SAO in my opinion; I would consider the story arcs and ending to be one of the more cliche alternatives I have seen in a while but the atmosphere during the scenes made up for it a bit. The main character was too well liked. Plain and simple. If he were to have had a rival or someone to push him around some then he probably would have developed more as a good character. The best part by far was the art, looking at the landscapes really made this show more enjoyable for me and hopefully for others as well. Lastly I would recommend this to those that have just started watching anime, after watching so much people start to get picky and notice little things more and more so you should enjoy this while you still can.",7

                SAO is one of the most talked about animes this year. It gets hype, it gets love, it gets hate. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides too. Don't come to Sword Art Online expecting deep meanings and though provoking arcs, its an anime that you can very easily watch with your brain turned off. And there is nothing wrong with that if you come to the table expecting as such. Not every anime has to be some deep, philosophical master piece. 
Story(5): Again, the story doesn't provoke much thought. It opens quite well, and the time skips were rather well played in
                  my opinion. While Kirito was alone, all he did was focus on getting stronger. You don't need a weekly update on his progress with that. The side stories were a bit rushed, and seemed completely irrelevant. After helping these women (who's names I can no longer remember), he simply went on and never talked to them again. From what I can pick up, Kirito doesn't interact with a whole lot of people on a personal scale. It surprises me that he never got mail from them or things of that nature. The story really only makes any sense halfway through the Aincrad arc.
Art(9): Being set in a video game wonderland, the artists were set free to draw big, flowery landscapes and ye olde towns under a big blue sky. Being able to ignore the laws of physics also made for a few well drawn backgrounds, such as numerous floating islands. It's an artists wet dream.
Sound(8): Personally, I never picked up on any repetition or stale music. It was either so underwhelming, or the tracks they used match the situations almost perfectly. (I'm siding with the latter of the two.) The detail of the sound work, from the player's menus to sword clanging to the rumble of bosses was great in my opinion.
Character(6): I can't lie, my tsundere sense was tingling about 6 or so episodes in. The reason my character score isn't lower is that I'm a sucker for character development, no matter how stereotypical or expected. You have the quiet, confident guy and the harsh, tooseriousforyou girl, do the math.
Enjoyment(9): Simply watching the anime the first time through, I was watching my clock every week for the next release. I couldn't wait. Regardless of how lackluster or ill thought out things may have been, I enjoyed the anime, and in the end that's all that matters. Reading other reviews I do see some flaws, but they don't affect how much I liked SAO. If you enjoy video games, and you enjoy anime, you WILL enjoy SAO, it's almost guaranteed. But just to reiterate, don't expect a masterpiece of plot and story. You kinda need to just blindly enjoy it for what you see.
Overall(8): It isn't the best anime ever, but it is by no means the worst. The action scenes were well played out, the art was amazing, the sound matched perfectly. The story and characters are a little bland, but that is the case for many animes. My overall score is 8 because my enjoyment score was 9. Regardless of any flaws anything has, and this goes for the entirety of life, if you enjoyed it, it was worth it. And being an avid video game player and anime watcher, this seemed like a great anime for me, and it was.",8

                Life isn’t so bad. It’s not so bad~ SAO
 We all like to play games: fighting, racing, action games, etc. But the anime I'm going to review today is SAO(virtual reality game, MMORPG). This anime takes place in the year 2024 where technology has influenced a lot. This is the story of people who started playing SAO, when suddenly they get trapped inside the game. if a person's HP falls to 0, he/she dies in the game as well as in the real world. The people won't get out of the game until they have completed all the 100 floors, defeating all the boss levels.
                  Somewhere between the episodes 19-23 the story is exaggerated where the time is wasted.
     Otherwise, this anime has a good story, so i'll mark it as: (6/10)
                                              ____________
    ART: (9/10)
  WHAT I LIKE IN SAO? Maybe, when ever playing a game I look at the sceneries,graphics(art). The art of SAO is simply attractive, beautiful and gorgeous...They have focused on the most delicate thing like making the grass of natural color, the butterflies, insects and other beats and animals. SAO takes high points in art.
                                               ___________
   SOUND: (9/10)
  In every anime what i like are the opening and ending songs. In SAO, both opening songs have extremely good music as well as lyrics and unlike opening songs, ending songs are slow but they are also good. Whenever starting a new episode the opening song made me excited.
SAO also took high points in sound/music.
                                               __________
   CHARACTER:(5/10)
 The viewer in anime watches the characters and how are they made. In my opinion, the characters were made good. when Kirigaya(Kirito) fought to someone, his expressions showed and told that what was he feeling, the pain he was feeling at that time. Kirigaya attracted girls. He was a die hard fighter. In the beginning Asuna was shown as a leader of the guild but later she depended on Kirigaya. this is the reason why i gave low points in the character. Whereas Sugu being Krito's sister fell in love with him in ALFheim online not knowing that kirito was his brother(Kirigaya). This was rather entertaining.
                                          ____________
 Enjoyment: (5/10)
  I enjoyed the first half of SAO and the last two episodes ..The between episodes were time wasting. well, there are some scenes viewer enjoys the anime , like when fightinng the boss or a great monster, that felt really great.
                                      ________________
            OVERALL: (6/10) 
    Although , it is not worth watching again, but i would recommend myself to watch it again as it has a good story and great sound art.
WILL BE WAITING FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.",6
"
                I think most people that began watching Sword Art Online, did it because of the MMORPG factor. Needless to say I was very disappointed when SAO became nothing more than a love history.
The last couple of episodes have pretty much killed my interest in the series. When most anime tackle themes of love it typically ends up being pretty bad and sappy, but this one.. it was just awful.
The world isn't well thought out at all, the writer didn't bother to lay down the rules of this MMO world, the pacing is INCREDIBLY off, they missed a LOT of opportunities to make fun in-jokes about
                  online gaming, and it's a pseudo-harem. The harem element in it sucks. Not to mention they force down your throat ""OH LOL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY HIS SISTER IT'S HIS COUSIN"" because HEAVEN FORBID a single female character under the age of 20 in this show NOT fall in love with the main character- Just because you need to know how awesome he is.
It's a poorly written, super contrived self-insert fanboy story. One reviewer described it as ""Twilight Saga for teenage boys"", and I agree whole-heartedly. 
There is NOTHING psychological about SAO-- There could have been, but they just didn't bother. It honestly feels like it was written by a 15 year old, and from what I've heard he DID write it when he was 15 and it very much shows.
 I haven't heard anything of substance other than ""WELL IT'S REALLY COOL AND STUFF"". And for the record, I have watched 15 episodes. So it's an overrated show.
The biggest problem with the harem element in SAO is that it doesn't add anything at all to the story. It didn't need to be there. The very first girl didn't bother me because they kept going back to his guilt with her, so that was fine. Asuna was obviously fine because she's the main interest. But the beast tamer and Asuna's best friend AND HIS FRIGGIN LITTLE SISTER were all INCREDIBLY unnecessary and didn't add ANYTHING. Their only purpose is to make Kirito look better. Any of those characters could be replaced by male friends as opposed to female potential love interests.
The characters, as mentioned before, are bland.
As for the mainstream shows, they get plenty of hate and quite frankly they are all FAR better shows than SAO. I mean that in all seriousness. Every one of those has a lot of complexity to the show, fun characters, good story, some amount of thought required, and has a large helping of entertainment.
I may not like some of them but I can admit that at their core they are decent shows and I can see why people like them. There IS something to them, some kind of substance. Are they overrated? Sure, but they still get a TON of flack.
The writers for each of those shows put a LOT into them. Those shows stand out and have personality. There is no soul or personality to SAO. None. This There is no character development in SAO. NONE.
The end of the MMORPG arc was just about getting married in a computer game and random people complimenting them on how they were so happy.
What happened to the ""Lets-get-out-of-this-place-no-matter-what""?
The plot became nothing more than You are 12 and I am 12. We should get married and have an 11 year old daughter. har har.",2

                Whenever I state my opinion about a show that is immensely popular, I often don’t use the term “overrated”. The reason for this is because when people use the word, they often mean “you like a show I hate”. The times when I use that term, I try to make sure that it’s understood as “the show is getting more credit than it deserves”. Not only when it comes to bad shows, but also those that are good and worth your time. If anything is treated as a masterpiece when it’s not close to it, overrated is the word of the day. 
In my review
                  of the most talked and viewed anime of 2012, that word is the short version of my feelings for this show.    
Sword Art Online (a.k.a SAO) is an anime adaptation of a Light Novel with the same name that was released in 2009. The author of the novel is Kawahara Reki, who is also known for writing Accel World, another popular novel that received an anime adaptation earlier than SAO. Judging from works, Kawahara always use games as the center subject of his stories.  
The anime itself is directed by Itou Tomohiko and the studio behind the show is A-1 Pictures, known for other well-known adaptations such as Kuroshitsuji, Fairy Tail and Ao no Exorcist. While I’m not familiar with most of their works, it quite safe to assume the show is in decent hands. 
Let me get one thing straight. I’ve played a few MMO’s in my younger days and currently play sometimes when I’m bored (And the last MMO I played was in 2011). In all of them, I was like Kirito, a Solo Player. I rarely teamed up with a guild, joined a party or talked to anyone (Mostly because players prefer the internet language, which I don’t understand very well). The only difference between me and him is that I was never among the best. The highest level I achieved in an MMO is level 40, while Kirito have top marks like it’s genetic. MMO games are a lackluster to me now due to the amount of hours spent on just leveling up and boring questing. 
However, I was drawn back to that world when I watched my first episode in a small anime convention that showed the first four episodes. I was enjoying it and it was something I’ve never experienced (I have not seen .hack). I decided to take a dive into this new world and returned to the surface with something to share the world with.  
PLOT:
My reason for watching it in the first place was because of the concept. When I found out that the story was “A virtual reality game turned into a real life death game”, it caught my interest. Not only that, but the world was solely created to satisfy a sadistic scientist who wanted to play god for real (That was my impression of the introduction). The first episode game me a good impression and a determination to see more of the show. From that point forward, I was really enjoying myself.
But that did not last. It has been discussed by hardcore and casual fans alike where the story started to fall. The most common one is episode 3 to episode 7, because those stories were side stories in the original light novel series. If it’s true or not matters little, since the main storyline isn’t any better. If the side stories were hated for being about random sh*t, then the main one does not deserve more praise. To me, both the filler and the main story are equally as bad that I almost thought they were the same thing. And when things get a bit more exciting after a mini story with little purpose was done, the story decided to end there. How things turned out was a bit unexpected, but it felt forced at the same time. It was like the writer was in a hurry. If the original story was longer, I might’ve not criticize it as much as I did now. 
What made it somewhat worse was that the second half of the story focuses on an entirely different plot and concept. The appeal of the original concept was lost when the story decided to be about something else and forget why many viewers started watching it in the first place. This would’ve worked better if it was a sequel to the story (like a second season) instead of being a part of the same season. That’s the ALO arc for you.  
But the reason why the story fails to become what many wanted to see was because of how messy and poor the execution is. The amount of time skips, side stories and how short the main story was proved that the writing of the story is in fact quite bad. I learned from classes about movies that a story has a specific structure to work. While I will not go into detail due to the fact it takes forever, I’ll just say that SAO follows that structure poorly. It’s like it’s missing a pillar somewhere around the end. 
Personally, I loathed the cheap drama and the Deus ex Machina. The drama was so laughably predictable in a narrative sense I felt unmoved, even when the story gave me its saddest scene. The Deus ex Machina was used so often that it made me think that the creator ran on limited imagination when this was made.
And of course, my number one question was unanswered through the entire series. I assume you all know, but if you don’t, I’ll just say “f*cking Kayaba”.          
CHARACTERS:
Believe it or not, the true reason why Sword Art Online falls flat for me is the characters we have followed through the whole story. Within the community, there are a fair amount of love and hate for them. Or to be correct, there are a fair amount of love and hate for Kirito or Asuna, because nobody cares about the rest. What there is to know is that SAO have quite a share amount of characters, and since the game is focused on an MMO game and not an RPG, it’s only natural that there are so many people to know about. Sadly, this anime does not succeed to get a high score in the character section.
Let’s start with our lead characters:
Kirito (a.k.a Kirigaya Kazuto), the main protagonist is described as an average kid with socialization problems, except that is not true. While it is shown, it’s only portrayed when secondary character Klein is shown. To everyone else, he has no problem at all. That is beside the point, however. In the anime community, he is either a lovable badass or a hated Gary Stu. But what’s problematic about him is not only because he’s a perfect hero, but his character in general. Besides the fact he is designed like every other generic harem male lead, Kirito’s reason for hitting the trash can is because he has no true identity. 
His entire personality is based depending on what scene is being played. If the scene requires him to be stupid, he is stupid. If it requires him to be smart, he is smart. If he needs to be a badass, he is badass. The idea is that there is nothing about Kirito that identifies him, at least not as an individual. This could also be because of how he is portrayed as some boys want to be and becomes a wish-fulfillment type of character. All the character traits that are given to him are what defies a guy as perfect and at the same time, deny him any other traits. This doesn’t give him a strong character identity, but it rather makes him a prime example of a Gary Stu character. In other words, his character is so scattered and unbalanced that I can’t even call him a character of a story, but rather a visual novel protagonist with a voice and eyes.  
Asuna, the main heroine shares the same problem, but on a different scale. While Kirito has little character to speak of, Asuna has too much of it to have an identity. When we first saw her, she was a quiet and mysterious person in the corner who rarely speaks till her face was shown. Next time she appeared, she was a tough leader with a cold personality. Next time, she became a Tsundere. After that, she was a scary lady. And after the event that… screw it, you know what I’m talking about. The distinctiveness of Asuna does not exist.
Every personality she uses is just different fetishes for the general otaku community to obsess over. And it works, because there are a f***ton of fans that adore her. Because of her multiple of personalities, I don’t even know what part of her makes her so appealing to others. Not only in the real world, but in-universe, everyone seems to be after her butt. In SAO, she is more of a prize than an ally to her guild, and Kirito fights them to claim said price. Her character becomes less chaotic later in the series, but then she is just and only the main love interest that relies on Kirito all the time and it pisses me off.   
Now, if the fans of her comes to my door and points out that she can kick ass, I simply reply “Bullsh*t”. While she can pack quite a punch and is one of the most powerful players in the game, she never had a moment to shine. When an important fight is on screen, she is either a decoy, a distraction, a helpless damsel or a meat shield. Not only that, but Kirito takes all the credit in every fight, making her more of a motivation pet rather than a fellow comrade in arms. It’s quite clear she is only a fighter because it attracts more attention and making her more appealing to female viewers (which doesn’t always work). The fact that a female character can fight doesn’t automatically make her a good character.  
Oh, I hear “what about Suguha?” in the background, but I’ll keep it short. I’ll be honest and say I was interested in her when she appeared. I did not expect a good character since the ones before didn’t do their job, but her relationship with Kirito in the real world made me hope for something I’ve not seen in anime for so long: a brother and sister relationship with no incest. But of course, I got slapped in the face by the show and it laughed it’s a** off when my hopes were broken. It was nice to focus on someone else than just the “Twilight v2” couple, but she didn’t create a strong impression and felt like just another collection of Kirito’s harem. The only point I give her is that she tried to stay away from him because they were siblings, but adding incest at all still did not change my everlasting hate for its enormous presence in modern anime. Yes, I know they are in reality cousins, but we all know it’s just an excuse to get away with it.  
But aren’t there more characters? There are, but they are so irrelevant to the story that might as well be replaced by rocks and it wouldn’t make much difference. The Sword Art Online icon that is used on this site would give you the idea that the story focused around these people, but the truth is that only Kirito and Asuna matter at all. Every other character appears briefly and sometimes only show up in one episode before disappearing. Next time they appear, a minute cameo is all they can achieve. There are also those whose only purpose is to die, and it becomes so obvious in time that it’s not even funny. It’s a shame, because I wanted to see more of the side characters and learn a bit more of them. However, it felt like the series resented me for it and told me to focus only on the main characters (which I genuinely disliked). It was very frustrating, since I’ve always have hated that type of character treatment.
ANIMATION:
Unlike how I criticized the two catagories above, I can honestly say that the animation is quite good. While not so amazing that you get eyegasm by just looking at it, it’s above average and can be called stunning, if you willing to give it that much credit. When action is used, the movement is quite fluid and action packed, making these moments never boring and suspenseful. The usage of CGI is also quite well done and is used in a way that it blends in with the environment. This is mostly helped because the setting is a game, but it feels like a part of the game when it’s used. Even CGI haters can’t really criticize its existence. The background and setting material aren’t as impressive, however, but it’s quite safe to say it’s good enough. While it cannot hope to be compared with Ufotable quality, it at least above something completely unimpressive like Naruto. 
One thing that the animation can be criticized for is its habit of using shots that has no movement. It’s mostly used during large crowd sequences, which is somewhat understandable. It’s not the first anime to use them and it’s not a prime example of an anime that uses it all the time, but it’s something to think about.
Oh wait. There is also a bit a fanservice as well, and anybody that knows me knows that I loathe anime that takes that route. However, it does not appear so much or get in the way when something serious is happening, unlike something that uses it so much that it’s annoying like High School of the f*cking Dead.                   
SOUNDTRACK:
One thing I cannot badmouth about is the music of the show. In the anime community, just knowing that Kajiura Yuki is doing the music automatically means win. I can’t blame them, because her work in one of my favorite shows of all time still impresses me to this day. Unfortunately, even she can't save the show. While the soundtrack was very good, it was not her best work. Many are forgotten and I only remember a few, and it’s mostly because they were repetitive. Still, the songs did fit the scenes when it was used and were quite pleasant to listen to. This is not Kara no Kyoukai or Fate/Zero material, but it’s good enough to stand on its own.
The opening and endings did not however do as great. All four were quite generic and obvious for a title like Sword Art Online, but they aren’t obnoxious in any way. They in fact are quite fine. Personally, I found Opening 1: Crossing fields quite catchy, despite how average it is. So I can’t say anything really negative about the songs that were picked for this anime.
FINAL VERDICT: 
The only way I can describe SAO in no more than five words is that it’s bad, but looks pretty. Not all of it was dreadful and some episodes were quite good, but when looking at the larger picture, I can’t accept its popularity or love that has been given to it. It might look good, but the things that keep a show together (Story and Characters) can only be described as awful.
Story: 5 
Characters: 3 
Animation: 7 
Soundtrack:  8
Enjoyment: 5
Overall: 5  
However, I will not discourage and tell you to not watch this anime, despite my low rating of it. It still quite possible to enjoy this series if are looking to watch something simple and average. Just don’t expect the next big thing or anything amazing. This is not for those who want something thought provoking or something original. And if we are going to question its popularity, let’s just say it was luckier than better titles of 2012.  
Now that I think about it, Sword Art Online works perfectly as a visual novel. It already has a generic protagonist and a harem of all type of girls involved. In fact, I’ve heard that the game “Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment” is just a dating sim game with gameplay. Are you guys sure this story was meant for a Light Novel?",5
"
                Let me start off by saying this review is based almost ENTIRELY on part 1 of this anime (which is the first 14 episodes). After reading all the reviews posted on here about SAO I felt that I needed to write one (and my first mind you) to clear the slate about what others have said. Could the anime have been better? Of course, but for what we got I think it was extremely enjoyable. 
Story: I give the story an 8/10 simply because this is the first anime of this kind that I've seen and LIKED. I think the thing I liked most about
                  Kirito in this is that he was a beta tester and a beater and to me that made him stand out above everyone else and really take the role of that hero and made the story revolving around him a lot easier to understand and enjoy. When I was watching this anime with my friend the way he described it was this anime is an anime of feels. Heavenly feels one second then sad hellish feels. Which for the most part is true. The anime story keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next, what boss is going to be found next, and what rare item somebody is going to die over next. Also I should really bump this up to a 9 because of the marriage in this but you'll see that when you watch it. NOT IF, BUT WHEN!
Art: Overall the art wasn't anything extraordinary however what gave it such a good feel was that in the game gear changes and throughout the anime their gear look also changes. And you know what's the best part? Kirito doesn't wear a gay ass orange jumpsuit! He wears a manly mans Black coat that only proceeds to look more badass as the anime continues. On top of that the art work really captures the feel of the RPG and the players within. But truly the most outstanding feature is all the costumes and the work and design put into them. 
Sound: I gave sound a 6 which probably isn't fair because when I'm watching an anime RARELY do I pay attention to the sound track in the back that happens to be playing. And if I do then I soon forget about it. So in light of the fact that I'm not going to go back and rewatch episodes just to tell you if the sound is good you're just going to have to trust me when I say it doesn't suck. 
Character: My god what can I REALLY say about the characters? Despite all the flaws to this anime's storyline the character development makes you completely forget all about it. I LOVED the characters. Let me repeat this. I LOVED THE CHARACTERS IN SAO! The main hero was a hero. Asuna was rude and (forgive me for saying so) bitchy in the starting episodes. Distant from kirito and everyone else. However seeing her and kirito slowly start to come together made my heart melt and made me appreciate and love this anime so much. Besides these two main characters the side characters are lovely as well. Whenever they'd show kirito's friend the blacksmith (forgive me for no name) I loved it. Because not only did the designers have the main characters develop they had the side unimportant characters develop too. If you were to see another character again you can guarantee that they would have different armor and perhaps an altered personality due to the game. Lovely in every aspect. 
Enjoyment: 8/10 overall. Really the thing holding this back for me is the part two of this anime and the fact that they made them scaling 100 floors to beat the game such a small part of the anime itself. I would have loved to see this be made into an 80 possible plus episodes showing the difficulties and trials on the floors with some fillers on some of the more interesting floors. However what they didn't do with the anime isn't going ot make me drop my score for it. An easy solid 8 if I've ever watched one. 
Overall: An 8. To those who are saying this anime isn't that great blah blah blah. You can all go back to watching your Naruto and bleach animes. This is a unique one of a kind heartwarming show that deserves to be watched. If you don't like it after episode 3 then stop watching but I can almost positively say you will want to finish it.",8

                Sword Art Online, the hype surrounding SAO when it came out was through the roof. Is that completely fair for this show? Does it live up to all the hype? Well... kinda, but not in the areas that is should. Let's dive into this.
STORY: 
Our story begins with the release of the brand new VRMMORPG, Sword Art Online. Players are able to control their in game avatar with their bodies while wearing something called Nerve Gear. On its launch day everything seems to be running smoothly until the creator, Akihiko Kayaba, announces to everyone that they are trapped in SAO until someone clears all 100
                  floors of it. Oh and if you die in the game, you die for real. PEOPLE DIE IF THEY ARE KILLED! So the story is setup like it will be an epic action adventure quest to survive, which is a really great idea for a story. Sadly the writers didn't focus very much on this at all, instead they focus on the romance between the two main characters, which I'll get to later. The problem I have with the story is it doesn't focus on the main issue enough, the issue of you know being trapped in a comma and forced to play a life-or-death survival game! The time skips that are in SAO doesn't help the story either, the writers condensed around two years of time into the first three or so episodes. I was left wonder, what happened in that amount of time? Why can't I see that? Many questions were left unanswered until the end (also I'll get to later) In short, the story was a mess, it was promising but it failed.
CHARACTERS:
Our main protagonist is Kirito, a solo player that likes to play a Massively Multiplayer Game by himself... yea so he is the anti-social lone-wolf cardboard cutout. I didn't like him at the beginning of SAO. He just felt like another generic quietly overpowered character that we've seen about one billion times before; however, over the course of the series I grew to like him a little bit more. Mainly seeing the affects of being trapped in a video game for over two years. This little ounce of character development made him seem more real. Next we have Princess Peach, woops, I mean Asuna. She was introduced as a badass female lead who didn't take anything from anybody, but she turns into a generic tsundere, because OMG Kirito! The romance between Kirito and Asuna is so forced, and so generic I'm fairly sure that a five year old could write a better love story than this. Kirito and Asuna didn't get along all that well at the beginning, but all of a sudden they get ""married"" wut. The last character is Suguha who is introduced later on an gets plenty of development by which I mean she is a walking piece of fan service and is completely useless without Kirito. Every female character that Kirito runs into seems to become completely reliant on him for no good reason. The supporting cast is... kinda meh. Honestly the supporting characters didn't do a whole lot for me. 
ART:
WOW, just WOW. The art and animation in Sword Art Online is something to behold. It is simply gorgeous. The world they are trapped in looks stunning and the action scenes are amazing to look at. The art and animation definitely shines its brightest when you see the epic boss battles. The character designs are also very good as well. If you the opportunity to watch this in High Definition, FREAKING DO IT! SAO looks amazing.
SOUND:
At this point I should just have to say Yuki Kajiura and that's all. The openings for SAO were great sounding and the OST was a great thing to listen too. She really is one of the best out there. The music always seemed to make everything better so thank you Yuki Kajiura for being awesome. The dub of SAO is also very well done. In the beginning I wish Todd Haberkorn was Kirito instead, but Bryce Papenbrook did a very nice job giving Kirito a shy and quiet personality, and he was also made the transition to very pissed off Kirito very smooth. I'm glad that Bryce got Kirito over Todd because well... Todd is in everything else anyway (included SAO) but also Bryce did a very good job with the screaming. Chermai Leigh did a good job as Asuna too, but there wasn't a whole lot she did that stood out as amazing. 
ENDING: (No spoilers)
If you've read any of my reviews you know my opinion about endings, THERE ARE PARAMOUNT! A good show can be ruined by a bad ending, and a mediocre show can be made great by a great ending. SAO sits around the middle in that regard. The ending is very much a Deus Ex style ending, it was similar I believe to that of .hack//Sign, but at least SAO offered closure. It wasn't a bad ending just a little bit fast. 
OVERALL:
To wrap it all up Sword Art Online is a great looking and great sounding show, but is let down by a messy story and characters that are hard to relate to. I do believe it gets better at the end, but I am still disappointed at the wasted potential that was left out of the story. I still recommend SAO to anyone, but don't listen to the hype about it being the best anime ever. It is an enjoyable watch.",7
"
                If you like anime where the main character is great at everything he does without trying well this is the perfect anime for you. If not, you'll have a hard time then. Don't get me wrong, one of my guilty pleasures in anime is a main character being good at what they do as long as it's executed well and they worked their way to it. This had potential to be considered one of the greats but had a poor presentation overall and gets too much praise to its actual worth.
Main protagonist and a whole lot of other people are playing  this game called
                  Sword Art Online with a twist that if they die in the game, they die for real. The only way for everyone to leave SAO is beating the game.
Story 6/10
The concept has been done before and honestly people who have been rating this show a 10/10 with comments saying ""OMG BEST ANIME EVURR NOTHING LIKE IT!!!"" I have to say shame to you and to go watch more shows  before rating this story a 10/10. In fact the only reason why it probably gets such a high rating from other is because it's fairly new and that the art is nicely done. 
Other than that, I wouldn't bother giving this a second thought. The characters were presented poorly and there wasn't much to look forward to since it follows the formula of protagonist has a problem, they try to solve problem, and then solves the problem. Nothing wrong with that of course but after the first couple times seeing it happen over and over with no real change it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Art 6/10:
I would of liked more contrast on the character looks; most of the main/side characters seem to mesh together into one clump and not have real distinction from one another. In fact if it weren't for names I would probably just call them main character number one and main character number two or the chick with long orange hair. Still the colors and surroundings went well together and that should get some credit. 
Sound 5/10:
There wasn't any music that really got distinction to make it stand out that made me want to look it up and listen to. I could honestly watch the entire thing without having sound and still have the same feeling about it. 
Character 1/10:
Having watched halfway I already knew this guy was not going to have any character development whatsoever. He was great at everything he did the first time around and everyone either loved the guy or hated him. There wasn't much that made any character stand out or want me to root to win. 
One of the things I hated about Kirito is that from start to finish on the show is that he hasn't made any real progress as a character. He stays about the same the whole way through, even with the losses he makes in game. Halfway through watching the show I found myself rooting that Kiritito lose a battle to just to watch him grovel and cry so at least I can watch his goody to shoes suffer a bit for being great at what he does.
Enjoyment: 5/10:
It wasn't something I could really say ""Wow can't wait til the next episode comes out!"" but it was also one where I didn't  drop because it wasn't awful and was already halfway through it. I found myself doing things constantly while I was watching it such as pausing it halfway to watch a different show or leaving it playing while cooking/eating. 
Overall 4/10:
Overall, it was something that helped time passed by. It had a decent enough story/art to want to watch through all the way and have some enjoyment watching. Unfortunately it's also something I will never bother watching over again. There was nothing memorable about the anime at all and the character development occurred as often as Kirito loses a battle.",4
"
                There are two types of adaptations. The first type tries to be enjoyable by itself for both people who know the source material and those who don't. The second type's reason for existence is to serve as advertisment to source material and other merchandise. After reading the original novels and watching first 3 episode I can say Sword Art Online anime is the second kind.
First episode is adapted perfectly and nicely explains things about the death game, that 10000 people got trapped into. It also introduces main character and few side characters. But the second one already rushes the whole plot a lot forward. They
                  leave out many scenes that define main characters and explain their motivations. They also try to introduce new scenes that make up for the exposition lost during cuts, but they fail horribly. Third episode is same, albeit little better. They left out less exposition and scenes, but thats because original material was much shorter than for second episode.
Thanks to this, it won't be surprising if many people are be confused by character's actions and ask 'Why?"" and ""How?"" many times during those two episodes and even future ones. The feeling of rushed plot is felt even by people who didn't read the novels and that is saying something.
Later episodes probably won't be better.They are obvious trying to adapt as much original material as possible while not having any reason to keep the storyline and character development solid.
Only good thing about this adaptation is great visual directing, attention to visual detail and Yuki Kajiura's soundtrack. But this is far from enough to make this enjoyable watch.
After finishing the anime, it seems I was right.",6
"
                Before you hit the not helpful button hear me out, I know as an anime sword art has many flaws, such as pace and consistency. However if you don't look at it as trying to be the next fate zero or code geass and instead look at it as an enjoyable anime that you can sit back and watch in a relaxed way just like you would an action tv show or comedy.
The story of Sword Art Online I have mixed feelings about as I love the concept of the VMMORPG and having to fight for your life and peoples reactions to the situation they
                  are forced into such as, Denying it, stepping up as a leader, Being a whiny B****or being a player killing fucktard. A large part of the pros of sword art online is that it does a great job of portraying all of this to the viewer in a short easy to understand way, it also does a good job of keeping into the MMO theme that they introduced and it remains consistent throughout the story that that is the environment they are in with constant references to how people play MMOs in real life like brief character interactions and forming clans with friends and going on raids. My problem with Sword Art Online is that it is too rushed, the first half only being about 14 episodes where it could of easily of been done in 30 and then the second half in another 30 episodes, but considering the first half took place over 2 years it lead to alot of timeskips to key events this leads to a waste of potential at times and a character who seems to get infinitly stronger every episode.
The Art of the shows amazing the studio seems to of put a large amount of effort into the art style especially the battles which were done amazingly, another note about the art is the contrast between the art when they are in the virtual world (Lots of bright colors and well lit) compared to the real world where it is slightly darker and more grey (but not to the extent of taking away from it) this adds to the series themes.
The sound was one of the best parts of the show the music that plays during battles gets me pumped up and sitting on the edge of my seat, and the two openings of the series do a good job of getting you into the feel of the two parts, Crossing Fields by LiSA does an outstanding job of getting you into the feel of the hectic and serious nature of the first half of the story and Innocence does quite a good job of portraying the more lighthearted feel of the second ark.
Characters in sword art online is one of its weaknesses, the biggest one is Asuna who goes from a character with the potential to be so strong and independent, to the female sidekick second best to the Protagonist and then to basically princess peach, this upset me so much as I had such high hopes for her as a character. Kirito's development is kind of strange and he is prone to having drastic changes in personality, one episode he is the badass rouge player who fights alone the next he is an angsty bitch (didnt last too long though) and then the next second he is the caring big brother type person. However all these changes do take place in between time jumps so it may be passed off as consistent growth over time and he does stay true to his characterization of being the best player in the game and how he will be a motivator for others. All the other secondary characters dont get much development but that could be seen as a plot device involving the one off encounters you see in an MMORPG.
As a whole I thought the series was really enjoyable it had a good mix of battles and fun and romance, it didn't go out of its way to try and be great but it always left me wanting more, personally I believe it is this years best anime. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who takes all show to seriously and have to try and find hidden meanings to everything cause it is pretty much straight a forward show.",9
"
                Sword Art Online[SAO] is a tricky anime to review. While I usually keep my reviews personal, I think SAO is something that should be approached only after you've researched it, because if you haven't, you may end up disappointed. Badly.
I'll start off by saying that I am an avid fan of the .hack/// series. I grew up with it, and even though it's not the first or best ""Virtual Reality Game"" anime, it always brought something new to the table in all of it's branches and reboots. My initial reaction to SAO was mixed, I knew it was trying to ride off of .hack///'s success,
                  but I was really intrigued by it's greatest feature- the fact that ALL players who die in the game die in real life. 
     Kirito is your average MMORPG nerd- terrible in real life and completely absorbed in his video games. Fortunately for him, SAO offers the chance to transition to an almost real world where he's unbeatable. A beta tester for SAO, he rises to the top and when the game opens to the public, he's ready to do it again. Except this time, there is a new challenge. Players are unable to log out of SAO until someone beats the game's 100th floor(the equivalent of a level) because of an insane Game Master. Also, they die in the game, they die for real. Trying to avoid as many spoilers as possible, Kirito continues his typical behavior and becomes one of the most important, although not well known, players. With the help of Asuna, an ally from when he first started the game, he may very well be able to save everyone. 
     This is where things sound great. There are so many truly wonderful and new ways to handle the story from here. Perhaps a Game Master who desires the chance to play God? How glitches or government interference make the situation worse? A mystery on who you can actually trust in a game where you'll be backstabbed by anyone?  
     By far, the biggest and most salivating premise would be a study on human psychology. How would players react in this situation? The anime is really eager to answer that question. Actually I spoke too soon. It isn't. Throughout the anime (and light novels) we see some really genius moments. Some players form coalitions to save the rest. Others just hide in the beginning town, where they'll be safe. Beta testers use their advanced knowledge to grab the best training spots and compete. Some PK'ers question the truth of the game, believing that killing other players will actually liberate them from the system without frying their brain. Characters even begin to wonder whether the real world happened and if they'd really want to return.
     But this genius is hidden among the most terrible, convoluted and twisted plot pacing/story I've seen in almost all of modern media. You'll see these great ideas hidden behind pretentious filler and useless romance scenes. I've heard the comparison of SAO to a young otaku's wish fulfillment fanfiction. And that's pretty much accurate. There is so much harem in this anime that a wonderful setup is completely lost.  
    SAO's pacing and arrangement is just so awkward I had to make a section for it. In the original light novels, thing skip around to level 78 after the beginning. That really isn't too bad once it happens. There are some cute side stories later. But the producers of the anime decide to show those first. And there are a lot of those episodes. In fact, episodes 2-7 could be considered entirely unnecessary. Again, more harem. Nothing else. Then, once important and slightly enjoyable content rears it's head, we get more harem. And what, due to the childish look of the protagonists, could very well be an underage creepy marriage. Oh, and an .Hack/// Aura clone that is somehow even harder to care about because she's just so dang annoying.  
     Unfortunately, the second arc doesn't solve much. Without spoiling too much, it's a very very very disappointing move, and while some may not mind, it's a terrible trope that ruins an already faltering storyline. 
     Despite this, the first episode is possibly one of the most well composed and addicting openers in an anime. It explains just what it needs to, it doesn't give too much but it sets everything you need to know and really captures MMORPGS and the human psyche perfectly. Watch that even if you don't watch the rest because really, it's nearly perfect. 
     Characters. Ughhhh. Kirito is a badass Gary Stu. What tries to be character development is rushed and not character development but just extra sympathy for a character we already love. So Kirito is awesome and terrible as a character. Asuna is simply adding to the breast count, she's a straight up Mary Tsundere and also lacks emotional development.  Every other character is pretty much pointless and in only 1 or 2 episodes, with no time for emotional attachment. 
    The art is a moot point. The backgrounds are truly great at times and really show the expanse and varying floors of SAO. But the art is just standard if slightly better than average. I will admit though, the menu screens for players that hover around them are really neatly done and very consistent. Don't ask why I love them so much, but they get the art score an entire extra point. Character designs are great, although when you're doing designs for characters for an MMORPG, that's not hard. I have small issues with how the producers tried to make the game seem like an MMORPG, because when they do it right, they succeed really well with AI messages and drop down menus. But they just don't do it often enough. Sound is good, not much to complain about. The MMORPG sounds are all really well done and quite modern. 
    And well, there is the real issue with SAO. Both the light novels and anime ruin a fantastic premise, but the anime does it even worse(the later novels of the light volume, uncovered by the anime, are surprisingly experimental and are more like science fiction than your typical adventure light novel; I highly recommend reading the series just for them). In a conceptual phase, this anime is godlike. When actually produced, it's a sad specimen. But really, don't let that failure get in the way of your enjoyment. Because while SAO doesn't do everything right, it's still a nice anime. It's not as effective or compelling as it should be, but if you liked .hack///  you'll probably get something enjoyable out of it. Maybe one day, a reboot will come and fix everything. Until then, Sword Are Online is a piece of milk chocolate with just 3 decadent hazelnut flakes mixed in. When you hit one, the taste resonates. When you don't, it's just chocolate. But chocolate isn't bad, it's just... chocolate.",6

                Spoilers Ahead.
Tens of thousands of players trapped in an MMO, forced to battle their way out? The concept of Sword Art Online was promising. The setting was in an MMORPG - an expansive, huge fantasy world filled with thousands of quests and monsters. It offers near limitless possibilities - as any MMORPG player will tell you.
Unfortunately, SAO really fails to capture any of the things that make MMORPGs fun to play. It takes off in a direction that few people were expecting and leaves many dissatisfied and disappointed by the waste of creative potential. SOA falls short in many regards, but especially in terms of
                  its plot and characters.
""In the near future, a Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online has been released where players control their avatars with their bodies using a piece of technology called Nerve Gear. One day, players discover they cannot log out, as the game creator is holding them captive unless they reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, if they die in the game, they die in real life. Their struggle for survival starts now..."" (Source: Crunchyroll)
This synopsis doesn't accurately reflect what the anime is about. It's the premise set up by the first two episodes, but is soon forgotten and is even abandoned by the 15th episode. What supposedly should be the major conflict of the story takes a backseat to what's really just a love story between Kirito and Asuna. Brief spasms of plot development occur every now and then, but are so poorly thought out that it often leaves the viewer baffled and confused. SAO uses time skips gratuitously - skipping forward two years within the first few episodes. In this time, characters become exponentially more powerful without any backstory. Characters aren't given time to develop and the episodes  themselves are often extensive tangents to the main story. These tangents introduce a multitude of characters that usually don't play any role later except for cameo appearances. It baffles me trying to understand this direction of story telling. Kayaba Akihiko traps thousands of players within his virtual world, making death permanent and forces them to play his game. There is a lot of potential within answering the big question of ""why?"" But SAO never truly gives an answer for this question. Apparently even Kayaba Akihko can't tell you why he trapped players in another world. This ""plot"" is so lackluster that it's really not an accurate synopsis of the anime. The overall feeling given off by the haphazard side quests doesn't remotely reflect the desperation and hopelessness characters talk about.
There are also a variety of MMORPG things that either don't exist or, when translated into reality, come across as pretty ridiculous and hard to take seriously. There's no animosity for beta players. The idea of a beater (combination of ""beta"" and ""cheater"") is completely unheard of. No guild would disband because of a loot drop conflict. Nobody thinks sharing an inventory is romantic. SAO focuses a lot on trivial aspects of MMOs without really noting the more notable things. 
The abrupt shift from Sword Art Online to Alfheim Online was pretty poorly done and confusing to the viewer. Sword Art Online had not really been fleshed out before it suddenly vanished from the anime - out of the 100 floors, major events take place in maybe three or four. The ultimate resolution of the main conflict is resolved within a few minutes with deux ex machina with no prior plot development, making for a very unsatisfactory conclusion to the world. The second arc of the anime does have a marginally better plot, but really only because there's a clear goal and stays on focus towards this goal. While it is the typical damsel in distress plotline, Sugou, as a villain, is pretty implausible. The concept of a random older man obsessed with marrying a comatose teenager and almost succeeding is pretty far-fetched and frankly, outright ridiculous. Again, Kirito defeats Sugou with the use of deux ex machina and saves Asuna from the perverted clutches of Sugou (Episodes 21 and 24 are pretty weird.) Kirito's cousin Sugu becomes a prominent figure in this arc...but the question really is why? What purpose does replacing the clear romantic interest with another romantic interest (a cousin, no less) do for the series?
Kirito is a pretty straightforward main character. He's brave, heroic, determined, altruistic, kind, and just - the embodiment of the typical hero character. He's fairly ridiculously strong - given the protection of the deux ex machina. Things occur that are nonsensical according to the anime, but Kirito overcomes through sheer willpower, apparently. When he gets killled in Sword Art Online, he just decides not to die (""A true man never dies, even when he's killed"").  His ability to resolve major conflicts in the story by realizing something is second to none.
Asuna is possibly the most inconsistent character out of any anime I've watched. When she is introduced, she is distant, quiet, and mysterious. She's seen wearing a cloak with a hood that covers her face and talks very little. But a few episodes later, she's the assertive co-leader of the knights of blood. Given, two years has passed, but the complete 180 in personality is still notable. A few episodes later, she's no longer assertive or distant. She turns into a typical lovey-dovey opposite for the male lead. Asuna, on numerous occasions, demonstrates remarkable swordmanship and competence - dispatching scores of enemies or even killing a boss. She then loses any ability to fend for herself once in Alfheim Online and is reduced to your standard damsel in distress. 
The romance between Kirito and Asuna begins abruptly and doesn't have much plausibility. Asuna is horrendously underdeveloped - again, the time skip has prevented the viewer from watching much of the interaction between Kirito and Asuna - before she becomes unconditionally devoted to Kirito and they get married (in SAO). She really has no reason to do so. The next few episodes are a strange collection of married life - they move into a cabin together, they get a kid(like thing), and they live together.
Now wait. Isn't SAO supposed to be an action anime? Why are there so many episodes about married life? The divisive focus of the anime chooses to really hone in between the love between Kirito and Asuna. But anyways...
The rest of the cast is very secondary and plays few roles aside from simply being there. Even Sugu, who is introduced as the the main female character in the second arc, is unquestionably secondary because the romance between Kirito and Asuna is already so established. You already know she's a placeholder. Klein and Agil are given so little time to develop that they're really only known as friends of Kirito.
From an objective viewpoint, the story and characters of SAO are very bad. It is very poorly executed. There were plenty of promising ideas that ultimately came to naught.
However, there are some positive features about the anime that still give some form of enjoyment. The sound and art are superb. SAO is a gorgeous anime. Character designs are well-made.
On some level, I really want to like SAO. It's the epitome of a geek's escapist fantasy. People play MMORPGS escape the confines of reality - to be able to fight monsters, quest, fly, have adventures, whatever. It would be an awfully tempting offer to live in an MMO world as your character. SAO offers, in some form or another, a glimpse into this fantasy. It manages to connect in, really, just due to its premise. But with all its faults, SAO becomes more and more difficult to associate with as the anime drags on. Things get more and more ridiculous and the plot loses any semblance of plausibility. At the very end, you're left with a disappointing, unfulfilled anime that didn't live up to its full potential.",4
"
                There is a huge hype how this anime is so wonderful so I figure I give it a  try.  
In my opinion the story is very pathethic I mean come on Kirito will beat impossible boss, save the oh-so kind Harem (falls in love with her) or secondary character then gets what he wants and then leaves.
The art I mean remove the fact that this is MMORPG tons of anime and novels have done a fantasy world and the battles are inanely bad. 
The sound didn't really go with the anime the music did not get you in the mood to watch the
                  anime.  
The characters themselves have absolutely no originality in the clothing, character design or personality. There is no character development what so ever. Their reaction are exactly what every stereotype would do, but what's disgusting, it's that they aggrandize it so much making them totally not believable.
The enjoyment was very pathetic.  I mean I was so hype because of all the great reviews but in the end I could hardly stay up and watch it.  I kept telling my self it's going to get better. 
Overall I gave this anime a 2.  
There is still hope there are still some unpredictables things that I want to know so I will keep on watching.",2
"
                I'm going to keep this short, nothing too in-depth, just focussing on the major points that make the series.
Story (3/10)
-
Sword Art Online had a good base to start off from; players stuck in a virtual reality game, not to say it's a new concept, but it certainly opens up to many different paths the story could take. I personally felt that SAO threw away that opportunity and instead chose to cram in as much useless junk as they could. They spent the majority of the episodes adding useless, one episode-appearing characters that were barely built up on, and other times simply threw in relationships and
                  add-ons -such as Kirito's abilities and high stats- on a whim. The sub-plot of Kirito and Asuna's relationship seemed to appear from almost nowhere, having met each other only a few times before awkwardly advancing in their relationship. 
Overall, the story did not make use of it's potential and instead chose the latter of a lowly built, simple focussed story.
Art (10/10)
-
The art actually left a nice impression compared to some of the other downsides of this anime. It was filled with many beautifully made sceneries, as well as nice character designs -most being side characters- and beautiful shading and colour combinations. They made very good use of this for the fantasy setting they had, especially the scenery!
Sound (7/10)
-
Not much to say for this, average sound at most parts, but very nice and anticipating battle music!
Character (2/10)
-
This was the main downside to the series, in my opinion. In the first half of the series they introduced quite a few characters that only made an appearance for one episode, these episodes took up quite a bit of the first half of the series, and these characters barely got any development! The only character that got any real development was Kirito, although Suguha was later added and given a fair share of development. Even Asuna became a bland character, where did she come from? What is her back story? Though she was one of the main characters, none of this was revealed. This downside made it hard to connect with any character aside from Kirito and Suguha.
Honestly, it felt like they went with quantity over quality with the characters. 
Enjoyment (7/10)
-
This section is based off of my personal feelings toward the series. 
Although I gave quite a few low grades on the show, I personally enjoyed it quite a lot. This could be because I'm an Fantasy MMORPG junky and this appealed to me on a large scale, but I did find most episodes exciting enough to keep me watching. I just wish the battles were more relatable to that of an RPG as opposed to a hack-and-slash style, as it would fit it's image better.
Overall (4/10)
-
The show isn't really anything special, it does get quite a lot of hype that may or may not be deserved depending on the viewer. It's like any other anime, it will attract many, repel many, and simply lure people who like to hate on over-hyped fads. 
In the end, it's up to you whether you choose to like it or dislike it, this is just my two cents!",4
"
                Ah, Sword Art Online, an anime that somehow got popular and by some is seen as the ""best anime of all time"". I beg to differ, People can get mad and try to defend this piece of shit all they want, they can tell me my opinion is garbage and that i don't know what im talking about but the truth hurts, when something is awful it's only fair to give it proper criticism.
If you even remotely enjoyed this heaping pile of shit then you are suffering from what I like to call mental retardation. Let me share with you why this show is nothing
                  more than another generic harem romance with little plot.
Story:
Ok I admit, the first episode of this show had me hooked. I mean the idea of being in a VR MMO was just awesome, the world even looked promising and seemed so cool at first, the idea of being trapped inside a videogame and being able to die sounded truly terrifying and even sounded believable when explaining that leaving the game in anyway would kill you! 
But then everything changed when the time skipping attacked, yep that's right, after about episode 2 this show starts skipping important scenes that are relevant to the plot.
For example the last episode you watched could of been Kirito fingering Asuna's (or Kleins) love hole and then when the ending theme roles and you move on to the next episode, Kirito is suddenly being raped by that one big black guy. But all jokes aside, my point is this show doesn't explain shit, it treats the person watching like an idiot.
The show has two story arcs, the first is of course SAO and the second is Alfiem online, im not even gonna talk about the second half of this show, it was so bad that if I had to choose between getting Ebola or watching that shitty second half again I think you know which one I would pick, and what makes matters worse is they could of seriously made this show good by not doing that and just using the 24 episodes to focus on SAO, but NOPE they had to cram SAO into the first 12 episodes and use Alfiem online for the other 12, i mean why? What purpose was there for doing this? what were they smoking when they tried doing this? 
Did they all have an agreement and said YEP! LETS NOT WAIT TIL SEASON 2 TO DO ALFIEM ONLINE! INSTEAD LETS CRAM AS MUCH SHIT INTO 24 EPISODES AS WE POSSIBLY CAN!! IT'S GENIUS!! GENIUS I TELL YOU!!
Sigh, oh well im done, fuck it, im moving on.
Art:
it was good, I mean what do you want me to say? it wasn't bakemonogatari good that's for sure but it wasn't terrible or anything, anyways yeah Asuna's ass got me a little turned on a few times so I guess they did pretty good on that.
Sound:
Probably the best part, I really like the music in this anime! Also character voices are good and shit, but idgaf about that, i just like the soundtrack.
Characters:
One word, Generic.
Seriously the characters are just so damn dull, I just couldn't like them at all. Kirito is seriously the most over rated MC in all of history, he looks just like your average harem protagonist and yet everyone loves this guy so much? why? what's so special about him? because he's good at videogames? I guess that's why everyone loves Kirito so much.
Then there are all the other none important characters they try to get you to care about, about the only good character at first was Asuna until the second half she turned into fuckin Rapunzel and had to be saved by our generic protag.
Enjoyment:
I found nothing good about this show except the wonderful soundtrack, other than that it was an awful experience and I hope the people who are actually reading this review will heed my warnings and not watch this failed abortion.
My overall score 3/10",3
"
                I'm going to be straight up about everything and concede early on that SAO deserves almost all the criticisms that have been thrown its way. However, I think it is still a very enjoyable series despite every flaw it has. 
Let's start with the negatives.
The perhaps most glaring problem with the series is that it's tried to compress too much material into 25 episodes. In total, it's adopted 4 volumes of the light novel. What that translates into are gaps in character development and plot explanations. While it's not all that difficult to follow the story, pacing suffered quite noticeably in the first arc, especially
                  because the anime tried to present everything in a chronological manner when the LN itself used more of a flashback progression. The second arc might've been delivered enough story without rushing anything, but the directors could've hardly expected anyone to stay for the series if they didn't like the 14 episodes of first arc. 
All that would've been fine if SAO had a great plot and a great cast. The only thing I can say about the plot is that it's as linear as anything you'll see. Details aside, the endings to each arc should be pretty clear from the outset. As for the characters, we have a main character who fits the ideal nice guy mold. Next to him is the ideal girlfriend female lead. Then you have the supporting cast featuring some more stereotypical good friend, lonely genius, pathetic nerd, and bitter villain types. Little else needs to be said here.
So why watch this series then? For me, the real beauty of SAO comes in when you try to immerse yourself in the world the series tries to create. And for all it's worth, the world invites your imaginations to run wild. 
Plus, even though the LN was written some time ago, the concept is still a decent one -- people trapped in a virtual reality MMORPG where hp = 0 means death in real life. As linear as the plot is, over the course of the series there are still some legitimate depth in the questions it raises. For one, when people can practically live in the virtual world, how would you differentiate between virtual and real? It seems like a rather trivial question, but it is eventually something society will have to address when technology reaches that point. Maybe we'll even see something like SAO in our lifetime. 
And as bland as the character molds are, they make for a fun and likable cast.  Though some people make the character out to be just another Gary Stu, he is far from all-powerful and suffers from a number of flaws, as he often admits. The female lead may be quite flawless on the outside, but the insecurities she expresses as a typical obedient daughter are not only real but pretty relatable. The series doesn't try to paint everything over with a gloomy brush, which means even while the cast struggles with the difficulties ahead, they remain generally optimistic and forward-looking. The ending featuring their interactions is heartwarming, even, as they've probably grown on you by this point.
One short comment each on the miscellaneous components. The action sequences are short and very, very sweet in this series. Even though on a couple of occasions the art quality drops somewhat, it looks great across the board and is probably one of the most pretty looking this season. The sound is nothing astounding, but it's definitely ahead of the pack. The opening and ending for the second arc deserves particular praise.
SAO can be a hit-or-miss. If you're an optimist with an open mind and some appetite for fantasy, action, and adventure, SAO is definitely for you. If you're on the other hand someone who prefers out-of-the-box ideas and intricate plot progression, then SAO is probably not the best idea. Anyone in the middle should at least try this series out. It has its flaws for sure, but from my experience, it's been an entertaining and satisfying ride.",8
"
                When i first watched this show i was totatly hooked the world and idea of the show where pretty amazing in my eye's. But then in the later episode's the show just got worser and wors story's that went no-where, characters that we never see again after one episode, kirito basicly being God(meaning that he cant do anything wrong), character motivations that made no sense but it atleast had a good ending. But then the second half came and it was bullshit from beginning to end so let me try and summon up why its bullshit on a list i call: ~Snowyfog's list of why
                  SAO's second half is bullshit~
1)The goverment still allows virtual reality games even though it killed people
2)A little sister character who is basicly kirito with boobs(suddle forshadowing)
3)The bad guy makes no sence
4)TENTACLE'S
5)Sudden beast transformation
6)INCEST
7)The worst love triangle between a gamer, a girl in a coma and the gamers guy sister
8)Bullshit ending
And that is my list do i have some good things to say about the show....yes.
The score was pretty good and the fighting animations where pretty good and the idea of the show is interesting and could have been more explored eghe eghe Log Horizon eghe eghe  but that is basicly it.
I really had such high hopes for the show but in the end the show betrayed me and kicked my in the stomach and then kicked dirt in my face.",3
"
                Sword Art Online is what happens when you have an interesting premise but the execution is so poor. It doesn't become a forgettable experience as it should be but a polarizing one, with some willing to overlook some huge defects and others wondering how on earth this got so popular in the first place.
The premise is great because it ticks a lot of boxes in the target audience: It talks about MMORPGS, it reminds us of how great fully immersive virtual reality should be, it raises the typical questions about identity, behaviour and personality in virtual environments and with the danger element added in the
                  first episode in essence it adds more depth merging the virtual reality of the game with the value of real life. Addressing most of this stuff lightly or not should be easily 9-10/10 material, too bad the focus is lost so easily.
As other reviews have pointed out, the main problems with SAO are in the atrocious way the story develops (pacing and deus ex machina elements mainly) and in the bland personality of the characters (see Kirito's jacket joke) but in my opinion the problem wasn't after the first 2 episodes but rather at the very first, after the villain appears. Why? because after that point we already can see how SAO isn't aiming for proper depth or consistency. The lack of purpose is clear when after such an important announcement the story just focuses on Kirito brushing aside anything about the real world, their connected bodies, the impact on everyone else, and everything else such setting can offer.
What happens next is an afterthought, a few episodes later Kirito is already the strongest player in the game, acts like a poor man's Kenshiro, gets every lady he meets fall in love with him due to his strength in the game (I guess it's not that outlandish as they're teenagers after all, but every single one?), falls into artificial love with Asuna, a case study for character involution (and it's a poorly done romance too) and defeats the villain with a textbook Deus Ex Machina (Willpower vs God). Everything is mildly enjoyable at best, the world was fun to watch but makes little of the opportunities it really had and the comments about a virtual reality world and how it affects the player never go past three lines so 5/10 I guess,  but that's not the end.
After SAO is finished for some reason they decided to adapt the second part of the light novels to the anime, on hindsight a very poor idea. This part introduces a new character, which being female naturally falls in love with Kirito. It also shows how great Kirito is at this, rescuing his love interest in a new, different MMORPG in a single week. The anime does try to make sense of this but it fails miserably, the holes are just too big for the arguments to withstand any basic questioning. Once again cute world and all but at this point we endured 24 episodes of the same frustrating stuff, which really hinders the enjoyment you can get from it.
When it finished I was left with tho sensations, the first one being the Virtual Reality and MMORPG things were there for the sake of it (which is quite a shame, the idea is really good) and the second one being the idea that I could make a better story based on this premise myself. Most likely thing is I can't but, was this so badly executed that it actually encourages those feelings in most people? apparently yes, based on reviews here.
What a wasted opportunity

                Sword Art Online is, without a doubt, the most popular and controversial anime of 2012. The Sword Art Online, or SAO, community is split into two groups. The people who think it's the best, and people who think it's the worse. I, personally, am on the latter, but I would like to voice my opinion. I also will not be talking about flaws from the second season for spoilers sake.
Story:
The story for SAO started out very strong. The concept of SAO was similar to the .Hack series, except SAO would hopefully have less talking. Being trapped in a virtual reality MMO where if you die
                  in the game you die in real life is basically ever nerds dream. Imagine a virtual reality Skyrim, except the game is extremely difficult and 200 out of the 10,000 players die on the first boss dungeon. However, the story has massive time skips which prevents from establishing a true sense of fear. Everyone adjusts to Sword Art Online almost instantaneously because of the time skips. It also leads to bad character development, but I'll get into that later. The story gets kicked in the teeth in the second half as if the first half was just a prologue, not to mention it wasn't nearly as good as the first half's story. 6/10
Animation:
The animation in SAO is actually very good. Animated by A1-Pictures, who previously have done such anime as Ao No Exorcist and Fairy Tail, have done a very good job with this anime. Every frame is detailed with great lighting, and the action is fast paced and runs at a consistent frame-rate. I think my favorite fight scene was in episode 9, when Kirito, the main character, was fighting the 74th boss, Gleam Eyes, and he pulled a trick out of his ass. That was a very well animated fight. However, the animation in the 2nd half is not as good. It's still good, but not as good as the first half. If the animation were consistently good, it would get a 9. But no. It got an 8. 8/10
Sound:
The OST of this anime was composed by Yuki Kajiura. Yuki Kajiura has fame from such anime as Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica. The music in SAO was very well constructed, with the battle theme being one of my favorites. I also liked the song ""Fight!"", as it reminded me of the beautiful M12 + 13 from Kara no Kyoukai, another one of Kajiura's works. There's really nothing else to say other than it's great.
Character:
And here's where SAO took a giant dump on itself. Because of the aforementioned time skips, the characters have no time to develop, especially the main character Kirito. The most I got out of him was that he's a badass dude who wears black clothes and plays solo and can win any match. Notice that he plays solo, which any MMO player can tell you is never a good idea. I play Monster Hunter, which isn't exactly an MMO, but it's still fairly similar. I can't even beat any of the bosses without help from a friend online, and that's what made the 2nd episode of SAO so great. He had help from the female lead, Asuna, to kill the first boss. After that he gets black clothes and suddenly he can beat even a dragon by himself. Speaking of Asuna, she's not much better than Kirito. She's introduced as an awesome character in Episode 2, but then she just turns into a tsundere (person, mainly female, who shuns a protagonist before getting to know the person and she lightens up and becomes a love interest) who got no character development because of the time skips. Same with Kirito and Asuna's love for each other. In episode 10, they get married, which is great. The only problem is that in episode 2, it was 2022. In episode 10, it was 2024. Asuna was also shoved out of the spotlight so the side characters can come in and be there for ONE EPISODE. You can imagine why this kind of love interest is bad. It gets even worse in Season 2, when Asuna goes and a new girl protagonist is introduced. She's even worse than Asuna. 4/10
Final Verdict: 
I think SAO had SO MUCH WASTED POTENTIAL. It could have been a fantasy epic set in an inescapable virtual world, like Fate/Zero in World of Warcraft. But the story and characters marred it so much that it's almost unbearable to watch. SAO gets a 4/10.",4

                (No Spoilers)
Sword Art Online is not the greatest anime ever made, as some 13 year old girls will tell you, neither is it a worthless ripoff of the .hack// series as others would say. But it is, in my most humble opinion, the best anime I've seen this season, and one I'll remember for years to come.
The story, as you may have heard, involves the characters being stuck in a virtual reality MMO, this concept is not wholly original, as mentioned the .hack// and a few other shows have taken this route before. However no other show in this 'genre' has ever immersed me in
                  the world as much as SAO, and thats worth mentioning. The story itself plays out interestingly, after entering the game and becoming trapped, the protagonist Kirito, a loner by nature, ventures off by himself to gain an advantage while other players remain confused. From this point the story takes on a ""Wandering Swordsman"" style of show, where every episode is in a different setting, usually with a significant amount of elapsed time since the previous episode, and Kirito uses his incredible skills to help someone new. While some people hated this, claiming the episodes were pointless fillers, I felt differently. Not only are some major characters introduced in these episodes, but it also reveales and develops Kirito's character. Eventually the sporadic episodes line up more and the series reaches a climax halfway through the 25 episodes, from here, the second half of the show wasn't quite as awe inspiring, or riveting, but it wasnt terrible either. The story, averaged across 25 episodes, was a solid 8.
SAO's art is fantastic, from breathtaking landscapes, to character animations, to epic fight scenes, the show is beautiful from start to finish.
Sound is impressive as well, a solid soundtrack (and impressive opening theme, always a bonus) left me with no complaints, and character voice and sound effects were equally good.
The characters in SAO left a little to be desired. While I feel the lead Kirito was the only truely three dimensional character (and some would argue even that) other characters still had a degree of depth. Asuna and Sugu, the love interests and female leads, both had fascinating relationships that developed with Kirito, and you learned alot about them through those interactions. However those moments came along with other scenes that left me wondering ""why is she doing that?"" or ""this feels kind of forced and cliche..."" Other characters are charming, sweet, funny, and sometimes lame, but their archetypes are ones you've seen before. Overall characters in SAO are an 8/10
As I mentioned earlier, SAO dosn't earn a 10 or even a 9 in story or characters, and in most cases, good art and sound dont make up for a lame story. And SAO isnt an exception, but SAO gets a 9 for enjoyment because of the vast, incredible world it builds. Being trapped in a video game with your life on the line sounds like a nightmare, but as the story progresses the viewer (like the characters) begin to realize the beauty of the world theyre living in. But I have to reveal my bias, as a casual MMO gamer, the setting and world did appeal to me more than it might to others. To put it another way, the game itself: Sword Art Online, would be a gamer's fantasy. From how the game operated, to the bosses, to the virtual reality, to everything else, SAO is what gamers hope we'll have in another 20 years, and seeing that in an anime was INCREDIBLY fun to watch, and would be for anyone like myself.
Overall SAO is a solid 9/10. An above average story and characters, a sweet, if at times cliche romance, amazing action coupled with stellar art and sound, and a world that'll have you wishing, like countless others, that you could be 'trapped' in that game too, these are the things you can expect from SAO. If that sounds like your kind of show, watch, enjoy, and thank me later.",9

                This is my own opinion, but I think the storyline is almost perfect in this anime. Several events relate to the main one, and gives it a bit more depth perception and understanding. This anime features a lot of action and talking, but the music during battles is what makes this anime really shine out. It may not seem much, but you feel the music just flow through you when the characters fight against a boss. I would have to say though that the events are really squished together. This anime focuses on a world where the players need to defeat the final boss to
                  win, but it skips several months in between. There is almost a different story each episode, which may or may not appeal to you guys, but it is at least entertaining to watch. Some comedy and heavy romance are present throughout this anime, as well as very emotional stories. The animation is very good, and each character or boss has unique looks. If you plan to watch this, I would not recommend that you read the manga first as it would take out all the fun in watching it the first time.",9
"
                To begin with, the story is something that already is done before and done better in other places, in the saga of Hack, among others, of the rest, the story is very simple and armed so Kirito is always the center of attention. The first arc is very good, but the second is horrible, very horrible, a patetic villan, bad designs, a shitty harem, etc... Another thing that I didn't like, was the ""themporary jumps"", where Kirito starts from zero and a few chapters is Jesus, in this aspect this anime fail.
Other thing is the romance, it which fails because it is not natural, and
                  the involved two are pretty bad characters.
Over, the series doesn't know what it wants to be, if an anime of action where the characters have to fight for survival, or a slice-of-life harem within a video game with a bit of action, getting whole chapters of Kirito and Asuna talking and doing things.
Already by the chapter ten and something the series already is a disaster, and when it reaches the second arc is going to shit.
Ironically, the first chapters were a very good thing, explaining things about the mechanism of the game and trying to be something, but then it deflates in a brutal way by the aforementioned problems, the characters and the story are in general poorly developed by focusing on the main characters, causing a lot of problems and plot holes.
In general, the story is poorly written and poorly developed, 3/10.
In the characters, is wost, the protagonist is one of the worst protagonists ever seen, focused both make a God forgot to give a definite personality, so his personality changes as needed by the script, it goes from being an antisocial a very social being in a second, emo to happy, from unsafe to completely decided, etc..
The rest of the characters can be defined in one sentence of a pair of words:
Asuna is the love interest of the main character and is a useless tsundere.
Suguha is the cousin/sister/whatever of Kirito and loves it.
Yui is a loli and loves Kirito.
Klein is the best friend of the protagonist and secretly loves him.
Sugou has something with Asuna and hates Kirito, that it is a f**ing butterfly. do you see it?
The cast is very forgettable and have no personality any more than the book of cliches of  LN says, 1/10.
The animation is very good when A-1 give you the desire to do something and makes a decent animation, there is moment where what stands out are the lighting effects, and the majority of the battles or are pseudo-animated or are pure frozen images, but when A-1 gets you desire to get something good, but the horrible designs the second arc going down too many points 2/10.
The music is composed by Yuki Kajiura, which is pure quality, and did a very good job, I must admit, 8/10.
I have enjoyed several battles and moments, yet there was a very boring parts which occupied a large part of the series, 5/10.
In overall it could have been better series if it had taken advantage of the potential that he showed in the first chapters, but fell like a House of cards and term being something bad enough and not recommended, 1/10.",1
"
                I enjoyed the first half of SAO. The first few episodes introduce you to an interesting concept and after that we get to see the main character explore the world of Sword Art Online. However after the first few episodes this series quickly starts to fall down hill. Sword Art Online starts to undergo a lot of problems which undoubtedly makes it a badly written series. 
The characters for one are poorly constructed. Kirito lacks any sense of character. He is bland, ridiculously overpowered (without balance either) and lacks any sort of personality that makes him likable. The author fails to characterize characters and there's
                  an overuse of rhetoric to compensate for the lack of characterization. The story lacks any insight into the protagonist's psychology, possibly a lack of dynamic psychology. Kirito's reaction to his sister being attracted to him (""Oh, my sister has the hots for me? Mmmkay...""). There's no character development either throughout the whole series due to the ridiculous time skips throughout the series which detracts from the overall quality of the story.
This series lacks the ability to deconstruct the situation past the first few episodes. How's the protagonist feeling? How are the citizens feeling? They may be immersed in this experience, but surely there are people who failed to adapt, right? This series is an enormous waste of potential. The first few episodes were promising but ultimately ended up being a series which focuses on romance and pointless harem. This series lacks any respect towards female characters to show off Kirito the invincible. Kirito's field of influence that turns independent girls into dependent girls that overly rely on him is an example of the bad writing this series contains.
This series also fails to explain some of the most basic things such as why the big bad of the first arc decided in imprisoning 10,000 players to their death. (""1. Make cool game; 2. Trap Players 3. ??? 4. 
Players Trapped!""). This just leaves us with a stupid plot hole. This series antagonists are basically just caricatured villains.
Sword Art Online is a prime example of bad writing. Sword Art Online story resembles a fanfiction written by a 15 year old girl than it does a story written by a professional writer. I could literally write 4000 words (easily) as to why this anime is bad. How this anime managed to garner such a large fanbase in the first place has literally left me speechless.",4

                Overview:
Normally I stick to reviewing old anime that are long past their peak of popularity or overlooked anime that never got popular in the first place. Today, ima jump the shark and review Sword Art Online! Why the hell not?
Story: 3/10
As you the reader are probably aware, Sword Art is another entry in the ""trapped in a videogame"" sub-genre of science fiction. Yes, it has been done so many times it is now officially a genre. The first entry was Disney's Tron in the early 1980s and then it was actually a cool and unique idea. Then came Nintendo's Captain N in the late 80s
                  and it was BAD, although the idea still seemed fresh. The 1990s brought us Dot Hack, which is the best the genre has to offer. When Sword Art came along, this idea was already tired and needed a fresh take on the genre to give it new life. Sword art gives us fanservice, flashy action with no plot, and tons of anime cliches that pander to the lowest common denominator. word Art was no doubt written by a team of marketers to capture the maximum demographics and make as much money as possible with no attempt to actually try and tell a good story. 
The plot begins with 100 gamers being trapped in a massive MMORPG similar to WOW. If you die in the game then you die in real life. 2,000 people die in the first month alone! Fortunately, a number of players including our hero Kirito have played the game before and are actually good at it. The players must find out why they have been trapped in the game and find the identity of the evil game designer. Unfortunately, the plot meanders around with filler bullshit and terrible pacing. SAO doesn't have emotional or philosophical depth, so it should at LEAST be entertaining. Instead it spends most of the time being extremely boring.  After the first arc, SAO should have just ended with the shred of decency it had left. Instead it launches into an even shittier second season with sloppier writing, damsel in distress BS, and more video games. Hooray!
Characters: 2/10
Oh boy, it is actually kind of difficult to review the characters because they are simply too generic and dull to even describe. The adventures of Main Character Kun and Waifu Chan! Even the villians in this series are lame. The character designs look good and fans LOVE sexy Asuna, but the personalities and character psychology is pretty awful honestly.
Art: 8/10
Here is the only thing SAO actually does right. The visuals are actually good as one would expect for the massive budget allotted to this piece of shit. Does that make the series worth watching? No. The art is good, but not breathtaking and unique enough to carry the series by itself. 
Enjoyment: 3/10
I really wish they were all playing Dark Souls. It would last maybe 3 episodes with only Kirito getting to Blight Town and dying from plague after a massive graphics lag caused him to take a poison dart from one of many hidden snipers. That or watch Kirito's entire team get FUCKED by those god damn archers at Anor Londo. I would laugh so hard!
Overall: 4/10
The massive budget and decent art saved SAO from getting a truly terrible rating. I can't give it a 1 or 2 if I am trying to look at things objectively. It is more accurately described as extremely mediocre and insanely overrated than ""one of the worst ever"". What I hate most about SAO is how carefully it tries to capture the right demographics and go by the book to make maximum profit. I would FAR rather see a series that actually has some fucking balls and swings for the fences, even if it results in a strike out. I enjoy series like Monster, Elfen Lied, Spice and Wolf, Higurashi. Do they have flaws? Hell yes, but at least they try! SAO doesn't even swing. It is a series so cynical and calculating that it leans in and takes the bean so it can go to first base.",4

                I was really looking forward to watch Sword Art, i'm a videogame lover so i was sure that i'd like it. And yeah i liked it, but it wasn't perfect, it has so many flaws that i'll explain later, otherwise it was a good anime series, i think you guys will enjoy it (And i really don't get why there are so many haters, I mean this was a good one, it doesn't deserve so much hate LOL....)
Anyway i'll start with my review now (And please understand that this is my very first review so it might not be very good... D:) (there will be
                  MINOR SPOILERS if you keep reading, be aware of that)
Story 7 - The idea is so original, well i've heard that the anime/game Hack had a similar plot, but still i found it a refreshing and new idea, and as i cleared before i'm also a videogame lover so i found it even more interesting, who wouldn't wish for a virtual reality game, i'd LOVE to get one, for real... 
Even though i liked the idea the way it was portrayed wasn't that good, it had so many flaws as i commented before. Specially after the SAO arc, i didn't really like LAO as much as the previous arc, what i disliked the most about it is how they brought out this new arc, that sudden ending (ep 15) how they made SAO disappear, it was TOO sudden. I was enjoying so much how they were going through all the floors beating all those powerful final bosses, but that ep 15 was so rushed. I'd have enjoyed the show so much more if the SAO arc were longer... The arc was nice i liked the fights and the relationship that Asuna and Kirito had (I agree that their relationship developed a bit fast, but i still enjoyed it), even though the first 4 eps were a bit confusing, you don't really know where the show is going. Now i found LAO a bit hummm not disappointing, but yeah i found it less interesting than the SAO arc, specially at the beginning of the arc, the last 4 episodes were really good, they kept me hooked up till the end of the series, the fights were pretty well portrayed. I ended up enjoying this arc as well.
Art 9 - It's one of the strong points of this anime, the animation is so good, i love how the fights were portrayed, and the characters are so well drawn.
Sound 8 - The soundtracks of this anime are pretty good, i enjoyed all the OPs and EDs plus the background music as well.
Character 8 - I liked most of them, specially the main leads of this series Asuna and Kirito, i liked the fact that they both are strong, not the typical strong - weak pairing, if you guys get what i mean... the rest of the characters were ok... I didn't really get attached with them but Yui... i really liked her. One of the things that i didn't like of this series is the ""harem"" thing. I know that the one that Kirito loves stays the same, but it's a fact that almost all the girls that appear in the series fall in love with him. (I don't like this because i'm not a harem lover)
Enjoyment 9 - I enjoyed this anime, it kept me hooked up till the end, there were better episodes and worse ones but it's definitely worth to watch. Of course it's only my opinion. 
Overall 8 - I pointed out good points and bad about this anime but i liked it in general and it kept me hooked up till the last episode.
It's true that there are better animes out there, but i would recommend you guys to watch it, give it a shot specially if you're videogames lover just like me you will enjoy it.",8

                Sword Art Online, one of the most controversial anime ever. Where to begin? For starters, I think Sword Art Online is extremely good. The first half was meaningful. Most of everyone's gripe is the serious tone of trapped in a death game was decreased by romance. But I think the image is too confused with Attack on Titan which was entirely on survival. Sword Art Online is really a MMO cover, but more a romance and action series. 
That said, here is where everyone is divided. Those who think Kirito is really cool and the people that think cause he's so cool, he has no
                  development. Both are true actually, so we're forever gonna have two sets of opinions. I'm no rookie gamer, I know it takes a lot of effort to get through a game. That said, I don't agree when people say Kirito is overpowered and always wins easily. I mean he did start off stronger than others cause he was a beta tester, but that don't make him God either, outside the plot holes. Kirito shows strength to conquer and overcome obstacles represented by the flashy attacks everyone thinks is just for show off. And so we have the legendary fights with the legendary OST by Yuki Kajiura. And I do recall that he lost before. 
Now onto Asuna, she was depicted as a badass at the start and suddenly turned romance with Kirito. Well it's not so sudden, let me explain the transformation. Remember Asuna is still a girl and girls like good looking guys with a good heart. The critical moment that happened which Kirito did to officially capture Asuna's heart was fighting for her hand so she could leave the guild. It's like Kirito gave Asuna her proposal of love. It was the knight's promise that I WOULD PROTECT YOU! That would move even me! And after some solo time together, a beautiful love life develops, lovers inseparable.
The side stories in the first arc, many people consider to be unnecessary. But without the side stories, we would never get the chance to explore the world of Sword Art Online. And it gives Kirito the chance to meet other players and befriend them. There is a big misconception here. No after awhile they are not forgotten, they just don't meet. I have played MMOs before and the only time you would constantly be with another player is if you are playing in parties. Otherwise, it is good game, we'll meet again. 
Alright now to the second half, this arc is harder to explain it's good cause the negative feelings come from the fact that it has lost the original premise of trapped in a death game. Rather, we are replaced with a save the damsel in distress story in a sillier elf setting. I would agree the first half was more exciting, but let's not eliminate the second half just yet. The story may have drastically changed, but our characters are still our characters. This arc is the TEST OF WILLPOWER! How strong our love and bonds hold despite torn apart. And with a mentally retarded horndog villain Sugou on our heads.
This is going to be really hard for some of you, but you're just going to have to accept the fact there's incest. I mean, if it happens it can't be helped right? I think Kirito handled it pretty well. He got another respect point from me. And the fanservice really doubled compared to the first half. Is that a bad thing? Maybe and maybe not. Maybe because it can be viewed as insulting to particularly Asuna, and maybe not because it fits Sugou's role and personally I thought the fanservice was hot as fuck. Don't worry readers, Kirito will once again venture out in this new world to rescue Asuna, just like how he's always been there for her.
In conclusion, I have really enjoyed Sword Art Online and hope you do too. There are various opinions out there, but I advise you to watch and form your own. Please give my review a fair evaluation. I'm counting on you.",9

                2012 Series directed by Tomohiko Ito
Produced by A-1 Pictures
Review from my POV (w/ personal biases)
(Sp)oiler level: Meduim
PROS/what I liked:
+ That 1st Theme song is pretty FN cool. LiSA knows how to pump a show up.
+ The animation for the most part was consistent with it's smooth flow (hair waving, action sequences, running, etc.)
+ (personal) the concept may be old (Main dude plays VRMMO. Dude and everyone else is trapped in it. Beat the game to be free and stuff) but it would be my first time being used in an anime.
+ The first 2 episodes made this show looked very promising............
CONS/what I disliked/hated:
- ....... The rest of the series (23 ep) ranges from ""meh"" to borderline ""unwatchable""
- (Sp) this show would feel more cohesive if level 40+ Kirito cared a bit more about completing the SAO mission. but nah, he just dicks around the lower levels, slowly making his own harem as the episodes go by.
- Romance element was too ""Tween-y"" for me.
- (Sp) ""Mama"" ""Papa""? WTF is this? Can i please have an A.I. w/o feelings?
- ALO arc loses the danger from the 1st half. At this point, the whole story is 100% emotional driven (which isn't good cause i don't like ANYONE at this point)
- Leafa/Sugu's whole existence is irrelevant to Kirito's ALO mission and becomes a waste of time
- The fanservice in here is insulting.
- (Sp) the last scene of the show involving Kirito's avatar makes almost no sense.
Final Note:
Trust me, this shit's overhyped. The 1st Arc's concept is cool, only to be shitted on with feelings and the 2nd Arc is............. i dont even know.
Consider a must see? - no",4

                Sword Art Online sucks. I could stop here and that'd be all you needed to know, but I won't. I'll explain why this thing is terrible and in no way deserves the hype/scores/praise/fanboyism it gets.
Sword Art Online tells the story of Kirito, a gamer that gets stuck in a virtual reality MMO along with thousands of others. Their only way of escaping is to completely clear 100 levels of a tower, each progressively harder than the last. Oh, and if you die in the game your virtual reality gear in real life microwaves your brain. Interesting, no? Well, surprise, I'm actually going to say yes.
                  Despite my opening sentence, the premise behind this anime is great. The stakes are high, it's a cool, unique setting and there were the beginnings of interesting characters. So what happened?
Nothing. And that's the problem.
Let's talk about the story, or the lack thereof. You might think, from both my brief summary and the synopsis above, that this anime would deal with clearing the floors, the epic struggle to finish the game. Spoiler! It does not. When the timeline isn't having an epileptic fit you get, at most, a brief summary of what floor is currently being cleared. That's it. Cool battles? Nope. Heart breaking loss? Hell no. How about filler episodes in what amounts to a 12-13 episode anime? No fu-oh wait.
The majority of the episodes in the Sword Art Online arc (the last, roughly, half of the anime is set in a different MMO entirely, which has its own problems but I'll get to that later) are completely pointless. A handful of them are devoted to Kirito helping, in one way or another, one of the few actual girls in the game world. When the episode is over, they've fallen in love with him and they play no further role in the story. I'm not even kidding. The entire episode feels like a gigantic waste of time and this happens MULTIPLE TIMES. Then there's an odd CSI-esque murder mystery that's based around an MMO term. It kind of works but it feels forced, like they just wanted the murder then scrambled to find an MMO reason for it to happen. Further, this goes for 2 episodes when it could easily have been wrapped up in one and, like everything else in this anime, amounts to nothing. And the few episodes before the end, which I won't spoil, are the worst. This is supposed to be an action fantasy anime, not a boring slice of life...I was going to say comedy, but it's not comedy. Or drama. It's just slice of life. You watch two people live their life together. Exciting!
If the SAO arc went for the full 24 episodes I could tolerate this kind of thing. A lot of animes have these ""filler"" episodes that give a break from the main story, maybe throwing in some character development or world building. I don't mind this. But in the case of a shortened arc, like SAO, they take away what precious little time the main story already has. You can't do this and expect to have anything resembling a respectable story. And since SAO did it, it's main storyline feels rushed and, frankly, stupid.
I glossed over the second half of this anime to be honest. It's set in a world with fairies and elves and the main villain looks like a closest butterfly, who also screams like a girl. He's one of the least threatening villains I've ever seen, which only adds to the lack of tension that comes with the life or death stakes disappearing. See, the new MMO doesn't trap Kirito, or anyone really, so if they die they can just log back in later. I believe Asuna is in some kind of danger but it's not enough, especially when I don't like her anyway.
Which is a nice segue to start talking about the characters. Kirito himself, when not being a Stu, is a bland and empty shell existing purely for wish fulfillment. He's a loner badass that all the girls instantly fall in love with and is insanely powerful and is the hero who saves the day because he's the speshul. That is really all there is to him and that's all there ever was. There is no character development whatsoever for him throughout the entire series. There's a half hearted attempt at a tragic backstory, but it never resonates and, like so many other plot points in this anime, falls apart when confronted with logic. 
Asuna is the other main and I hate her. Aside from beginning as the literal definition of a tsundere, she eventually ends up as another useless female incapable of doing anything without Kirito. This does not a good character create. Further, the romance between the two feels so weird and oddly forced that it feels like it was written by someone who had never actually been in a relationship. It amounts to they spend some time together, eventually she cooks for him and then they're in forever love. There aren't any specific events that you can point to nor does it ever feel that their relationship is growing. They just end up being a couple because the writer says they are.
Aside from them there's a handful of girls that make one or two episode cameos and are never seen or heard from again (a slight exaggeration, I'll admit, but not far off either). Oh, and there's Klein, a caring but kind of goofy guy. He's my favourite by far but only gets limited screen time, likely because he's an actual character and would shine a light on everything Kirito lacks. But when he is around he easily steals the show. I thought they might play him as the comic relief, which I would have accepted if for no other reason than to see more of him, but that's just one more wasted opportunity this anime has.
Animation is fine and actually impressive in some instances, the boss battles standing out. Audio is also good, with no complaints from me. I'll say here that there's nothing technically wrong with this anime; in my opinion the production values come off as fairly high. 
Unfortunately it's everything else that comes up short. Impressive visuals can only get you so far and when you lack any good characters, development or even a good overarching storyline, you're bound for failure. How this gets so much praise is beyond me, but perhaps you can get some mindless enjoyment from it if your expectations are low.",3
"
                Sword Art Online was one of the most controversial titles of 2012, garnering a lot of hatred and love from either side of the census. It ended up selling like hotcakes, perhaps in part because of the bad rep it was getting from some, and there we have it. A popular franchise, now on its second season. But is it worth adoration or repulsion? My answer is a resounding ""eh, I don't really care either way"". 
Let's start with what the anime manages to do okay with. The music is pretty good. You cannot go wrong with Kajiura Yuki. I do wish her skills were
                  used for a more polished anime, though. While I didn't care much for the first opening theme, I did enjoy the second ending theme and ended up listening to it several times while watching the anime (I usually skip openings and endings). The art was quite good and certainly worthy of praise. A hefty budget gave way for fluid animation and some exciting battle scenes.
The main premise isn't all that bad, either. A bunch of virtual reality gamers get stuck in an MMORPG (massive multiplayer online roleplaying game, for the uninitiated) and must fight their way to “clear” the game. The problem is that the first episode itself is rather foggy about exactly how one “clears” the game, and I went on for at least half the SAO arc wondering why exactly the players weren't more driven to actually, you know, level up. I made up from several conversations that all it took was one person to beat the game, and then everyone could leave. Perhaps it's just my comprehension that is wacky, though. 
What Sword Art Online fails with is making us care about what is happening at all. We know absolutely nothing about any of the characters. Developments seem to happen off-screen, the episodes don't connect to each other, and characters pull plot twists out of their derrières. What we're left with is a mess of interactions that aren't interesting or titillating in the slightest. Plot points that we should have been able to infer or guess for ourselves instead appear with little to no rhyme or reason. Revelations should leave me astounded or with a sense of satisfaction that I was right for my assumptions. Instead I was left feeling dysphoric and unimpressed with the anime's direction. Everything seemed childish. 
There are far too many time skips to make the viewer feel connected or interested in any way. Characters and events that I should care for lack the chemistry and artistic finesse to actually make me do so. This causes the main characters (and side characters, for that matter) to come across as under-developed and flat, which they are. We have little to no reason to actually empathize with them. Their stories simply unfold in front of our eyes like a secondhand play script, minus the emotion that an actual script would contain. 
Another problem that appears is the apparent necessity for Kirito, the main lead, to form a harem. Instead of actually interacting with his main love interest, part of the SAO arc consists of mostly stand-alone episodes wherein he saves or assists a girl of an obligatory archetype. We have the shy girl, the loli, the tsundere, among others. Most of these girls end up falling for Kirito in one way or another. What makes matters worse is that these characters usually do not join Kirito's party for long, if at all, making the episodes seem pointless as the girls often do not appear again. Combined with the fact that the majority of them aren't very memorable, it makes for a rather contrived manner of showing the main lead's many ""facets"", if one wishes to call them that. 
His facets can be described in one word: ""perfection"". Kirito rarely does something wrong, and if he does, it's clearly other characters' fault – or no one holds him responsible, anyway. He is the poster child for what every young boy would want to be, which would be fine and dandy in children's fiction, except Sword Art Online is marketed as a thrilling and nail-bitingly exciting life-or-death escapade. Kirito always has the best equipment, always comes up on top in fights, and always knows best. The first few episodes have him displaying one of the strangest and most jarring mood switches I've ever seen, made worse so by the fact that there is not even a hint of an explanation and that the mood swing makes no further appearance in a later episodes. 
While Kirito's relationship with Asuna, his love interest, was refreshingly mutual and realistic, it failed to make any sort of impression on me other than ""oh, hey, they're actually together"". The majority of their developments, especially in the beginning of the series, seem rushed and jarring in comparison to the rest of the anime. Things just happen, and we don't get to see an actual emotional connection or bond between the two of them. In fact, at first, they are downright hostile to one another. Perhaps ""realistic"", in this case, is not a proper word to describe them; still, I feel it's an apt descriptor for a couple who actually behaves like a couple amidst of a sea of anime where leads rarely get together until the last few episodes. 
That brings us to the second arc of Sword Art Online, and that is where things go horribly wrong, even for SAO standards. The lack of Asuna's presence gives Kirito an excuse to enlarge his harem – and perpetuate a ""plot twist"" that was completely unnecessary, tasteless, and downright senseless. A series of plot twists, even. And once again, these are pulled straight out of characters' behinds with no one the wiser. While the second arc does have a bit more of a coherent plot, it still fails to provide much entertainment value or intrigue. It ends up seeming like simply an attempt to provide wish fulfilment. It doesn't bring anything new to the table except more frustration and boredom, and in the end there is still almost no reason to care for any of the characters.
Just about the only good thing about this arc is that the main villain actually seems to have a tangible purpose, unlike the antagonist of the first arc, who simply existed. The villain of SAO's second arc also managed to come off as particularly despicable and it was quite satisfying even for me to see Kirito go to town on him, so I suppose at least they got that aspect right. 
Overall, the anime left me with a feeling of utter indifference and the sensation as if I'd just consumed too much junk food. And that's exactly what this anime is: junk food. It's not good for you and won't do anything for your health, but it might be entertaining for a little while.",5

                To state my opinion bluntly, Sword Art Online is a mediocre anime at best.  It's a pretty looking anime, but a bad one none the less.  Now I know some of you fans of the series are already prepared to tear me apart, but hear me out.  This review will be split into four parts: story, art, sound, and characters.  I hope you find my review helpful!
Story: This anime is popular enough so that I don't have to do an in depth summary about the plot for you.  If you're reading this review, chances are you already know what it's
                  about.  But, for those of you who don't know, this anime is about a VR MMO RPG that ends up trapping people in its virtual world and if you die in the game, you die in real life.  Thus the main character, Kirito, along with most of the other players, try to beat the game so they can log out and survive the whole ordeal.  Now, despite what I said in the opening, I don't actually have a huge problem with the plot.  Hell, as a gamer myself, I thought it was a pretty neat.  Yes while the latter half of the anime's story leaves some to be desired, I thought it was okay overall.  It was nothing special, but it was enough to get me interested in the series.
Art: The aesthetics is where this anime really shines through.  The visuals for SAO were nothing short of gorgeous.  All the characters and monsters looked spectacular.  The backgrounds were beautiful, being both captivating and interesting.  Seriously, hats off to the artists on this one.
Sound: SAO's soundtrack was pretty good, but forgettable.  There weren't any songs in particular that really stood out to me.  Unfortunately, I'm not too well versed in what makes good music good, so take this part with a grain of salt.  But, overall, nothing truly stuck with me.
Characters: Now, you're all probably wondering what the hell happened to that little rant at that beginning?  Up until now, I have done nothing but say positive (fairly positive at least) things about this series.  So, where did it go wrong?  Why do I view this anime with such disdain?  It's the characters.  One character in particular, Kirito.  This single character, along with a few others, ruined what could have been one of my top animes.  Now, having your entire opinion ride on a single character may seem petty, but if a series' main protagonist is just unbearably awful and boring, how am I supposed to enjoy the series?  Let me explain my problems with Kirito in the best way I can:
-He is FAR too overpowered.  I mean WAY WAY too overpowered.  While I realize being one of the best players in the game is part of his character, I can't help but feel annoyed when Kirito beats every challenge thrown at him without even breaking a sweat.  This robs most fight scenes of any sort of suspense or excitement.  It's my belief that a good character needs to struggle for victory, to experience failure and then improve himself to overcome it.  But Kirito simply beats most everything the first go around, without even trying.  Whenever he does seem like he (gasp) might actually lose the upperhand, he pulls some ridiculous shit out of his ass like dual wielding.  Maybe that could have been justified if the anime didn't use so many time skips and we could have seen him training and developing the skill.  But the simple matter is that moments like this feel like a cheap cop out to rob any suspense from a fight scene.
-His personality is SO SO boring.  Kirito is your average nice guy/badass/loner/brave/has a troubled past/insert another cliche.  I could forgive his OPness if he had an intriguing personality that I could get behind, but the simple fact is that he doesn't.  He is too perfect and, because of that, he is extremely flawed.  There doesn't seem to be a single thing wrong with the guy, which I find to be a huge issue.  Because of this, he just seems like some power trip fantasy, which makes the writing come across as silly and immature.
-Kirito hogs the limelight.  I know he is the main character, but side characters exist for a reason.  Almost all of the side characters are completely incompetent.  Even Asuna, who is introduced as a badass and independent female lead, is quickly shoved into damsel in distress mode so Kirito can fulfill his male power trip destiny.  I would have liked to see some characters other than Kirito have more badass moments, like the guy in the red samurai armor that he meets at the beginning (sorry, his name escapes me).  But, no, all characters must be completely incapable compared to our lord and savior, Kirito (sorry for the sarcasm, I know it's not very mature but this character bothers me this much.)
To sum up my issues with Kirito, he's a gary stu, and a pretty bad one at that.  He was the main reason I could draw almost no enjoyment out of the series.
Overall, my opinion of Sword Art Online can be summed up in two words: wasted potential.  The art was there, the story was there, the sound was there, but if I can't invest myself in the characters then I just can't enjoy it.  I might not be so annoyed with SAO if it didn't have such incredible hype behind it.  While it isn't complete garbage, it isn't even close to a masterpiece.  A masterpiece anime has to deliver everything well, story, art, music, and CHARACTERS.  When one is done poorly, it drags the entire show down.  I hope future writers will see this as a lesson in the importance of characters and will try and avoid something like this happening again (though probably not since the series made absolute bank).",5

                Sword Art Online, otherwise known as SAO, has become the subject of much criticism and praise this summer. Starting as a popular light novel written by Reki Kawahara and later being adapted into three manga, a game, and an anime- SAO has become immensely popular. After seeing several reviews for this anime, I decided to give it a try. Who hasn't wanted to escape from reality every once in a while? Why most of read books/play video games/watch anime is because we want to ""escape to another world."" However cliche the idea, Reki Kawahara handled it nicely. With interesting characters and the idea of actual
                  life or death hanging in the balance, SAO is not your average cliche. A lot of times when futuristic or technological anime pop up, you're going to find a lot of loopholes. Hell, even more than loopholes, the story just won't make sense. You'll think the story was written by someone with no technological knowledge at all. It makes me wonder, ""Why are you even in this genre?"" Thankfully, that's not the case here. The idea of nerve gear and the whole beta-tester idea was very well thought out. I was constantly thinking I found a flaw in the story when they would point out, for instance, ""Oh, the nerve gear has a built in battery pack, so you can't just unplug it.""
SAO is an entertaining anime that I look forward to every week. Sure, it's no masterpiece (yet), but a large variety of people are going to find that SAO is worth my praise. Having only seen 5 episodes so far, I can't yet give you a 100% accurate review. From the 5 episodes I've seen: The art's great. The sound is nice. The characters are interesting, and it's very enjoyable. So far  the story seems a little bit rushed, almost leaving you in a daze, but I think he could do amazing things with SAO in the future.
If you're looking for a nice, fun anime, SAO will most likely satisfy your needs. Even if you're not looking for a nice, fun anime, SAO also has it's deep moments. Because of this fun story filled with deep moments, SAO will appeal to a large variety of audiences. Whether your a comedy, romance, action or thriller lover, Sword Art Online is an anime that nearly everyone can enjoy.",9
"
                This review may not be as accurate as the others because I've decided to stop watching after the 10th episode. Also take in mind that being a avid gamer, I have some biases towards SAO (Sword Art Online) that are going to show up in my review. So now that I got my disclaimer out, lets start bashing this anime. 
Let's just say that I was hyped for SAO, it was about video games, a wicked twist, and every enjoyable aspect of a good MMORPG. Now where it falls (and it falls straight into hell, through every level of hell, and into the void) is
                  through the development of the plot and characters. 
As a serious Sci-Fi anime, it needs to have realism to immerse the viewers in watching. Every plot hole in a serious Sci-Fi anime, detracts from the anime itself. After watching SAO, I would say it has enough plot holes to satisfy every horny teenager in the world and more; except for the fact that these holes are big enough to suck in our entire universe. The anime doesn't make sense scientifically, nor do the characters react in a way that normal people or gamers would. 
 FOR EXAMPLE SPOILER(many people don't die of natural causes: lack of water, food, muscular dystrophy etcetc, and even if they got to a hospital, can they really hospitalize that many people within 2 days(water) and for that long?)
Now the reason why I've decided to stop watching this anime is the amount of cheesiness in SAO. I like a small amount of cheese in my anime just like how I like cheese in my pasta. But, the amount of cheese in the anime is like walking into my favorite most legitimate Italian restaurant: Olive Garden, then having the waiter/waitress continuously grate cheese onto my pasta until the entire restaurant is filled with their highly exclusive aged Parmesan. The love interest is cheese, the lines they say is cheese, the fight scenes are cheese, the cry scenes are cheese, the friends are cheese, the traps are cheese. Pretty much everything is so obvious and overused in SAO that it is impossible to say that SAO is original and keeps you on your toes. There are way too many times that the main character's health goes to tip minimal that it becomes a common non-thrilling occurrence.  
FOR EXAMPLE SPOILER( The female was crying over Kirito being all  ""boo-hoo you passed out for a few seconds I thought you died..."" Please plebeian, we both know that if someone dies they shatter into a gazillion dust bunnies and also we both know you can see his bloody health bar indicating he is clearly still alive(even though this anime shouldn't be)).
SO IN THE END, EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T DECIDE TO READ THIS FAR OR SKIPPED TO THE END: IT HAD POTENTIAL, DROPPED THE BALL, COVERED THE PLAYGROUND IN GOOEY CHEESE, THEN I WALKED AWAY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO WATCH THIS, BEING A FAMILY SIZED BAG OF CHIPS AND AN EMPTY BAG OF EXPECTATIONS.",3

                As a kid I remember picking up a lot of different games for systems. The first console I ever touched was a SNES and the first operating system I used was Windows 3.0. The first Action RPG game I ever played was in 1996 and a product of Blizzard North and Activision, you may know this game as Diablo. To this day Diablo is still one of my favorite games to play.
Sword Art Online to me was a mixed bag of emotions because it employed a melting pot of a number of negatives and positives. I've always been a huge fan of anything remotely considered
                  RPG and I couldn't help but picking this up. I can't say I'm a real die hard fan of this because some of the elements pissed me off.
I really had some good expectations leading into this just reading a basic summary and the story was definitely something I could enjoy on a weekly basis. I liked the idea of what you would call a permanent hardcore mode, really just a casual gamers way of describing the nature of the game being life threatening or as someone from the ghetto might call it ""YOLO"". The first episode definitely hooked you in and kept you coming back for more per usual ending episode cliffhangers. I liked how the story progressed into what you would typically see in a RPG: level up, meet some friends, and making a name for yourself. Kirito seemed to really become the typical hero you would expect him to be and properly utilize his knowledge of the game. Although my expectations were not fully met I can say this was a decent half and hour spent per week.
Thats not to say I didn't like the entire plot, the different arcs is where I started to branch of different feelings. I enjoyed the SAO arc but when the ALO arc came around I found myself not liking the content being presented. The story seemed to be sluggish and slow progressing compared the the SAO arc and there was more conversation time and drama build up over a love triangle. The lack of fights and all out battles in the ALO arc really left a sour taste in my mouth. They still managed to keep the ""Game of Death"" theme because Kirito was really fighting for more than his life for the majority of the story. I felt the writers could have split this into two different seasons rather than combine them, the SAO ending was appropriate but they seemed to lose focus after it. I'd rather not even say anything about the rushed ending. The writers focusing a majority of the central plot around a Kirito and Asuna relationship is what made the chains move for pretty much all 25 episodes. But one of the one things that pissed me off most was the cheap tactic of overused cliffhangers. It seemed that at the end of almost every episode the writers used a cliffhanger to draw you back in, this gives birth to the reference ""Enjoy your crappy show"".
As a gamer; visuals and end game content are probably what is most important to me, my recent bitter taste of hate came after the release of Diablo III, guess why? No end game content just excellent visuals. That's not to say Sword Art Online didn't have above average visuals. The environments of these VRMMO's were animated very well, I liked how Takeda Yusuke and his team put effort into blaring battle visuals and scenery that could match real world environments. There were a number of different environments that you would typically see in a MMO that made it feel realistic and not cheesy. The characters were all crafted as not to seem completely un-realistic despite what would have happened if the writers allowed them to keep their SAO alter egos rather than doing what they did and revert the players to their real world images.
The one point I have to overlook however is some character designs and inconsistencies. Some of the visuals tried to force a gross amount of fanservice which can really derail any series due to its nature to disgust people. Panty flashes and breast hops aren't really something fit for a series like this, it makes it turn a slightly different direction of hack and slash. The character known as Suguha seemed to have implants through the second part of the series and the animators and writers tried to make the character more appealing. The level of inconsistency had me shaking my head because it frustrates some people to change a characters design mid way.
Some of the characters seemed like they were just put there for cameos and the writers focused too much on the main characters rather than incorporate everyone in the story. I can't really say much about them, I never had a particular favorite character.
Still, a game isn't a game if you have just visuals and amazing content. You need sound effects to put you in the mood. Iwanami Yoshikazu put some feel into the battle scenes with intense choir vocals that gave battles more edge and combined with the animation the battles were probably all I looked forward to. I never really favored any of the ending or opening themes, I wasn't a fan of the visuals or sound tracks, I rarely find a series with good original sound tracks. I heard a lot of hype around the first opening done by Lisa but I didn't jump on the bandwagon. The voice actors all performed their jobs well and I can't dock them any points for bad performances.
The sour taste makes me think the writers could have done better job in the second half of SAO with the ALO arc. When the writers tried to throw another person into the relationship between Asuna and Kirito it felt too forced. The whole scenario could have been avoided due to the nature of it being a cousin  on cousin relationship even if it was one sided. In the ALO arc I really hoped for more battle scenes and fights but was only presented with a handful of average fight scenes and maybe one good scene. The whole idea of the second half was to travel some distance to the World Tree which ended in a number of episodes of wasted time. It made it feel like the Frieza/Goku fight from Dragonball, really just a lot of wasted time. Then the writers tried to add another plot branch which involved the world of ALO simply being a test bench for mind control. This concept seemed idiotic because it adds multiple goals to derail the central theme and goal along with everything else. The writing was just really not that great for the second half.
The concept of a virtual reality RPG isn't something I wish on the world. There are a number of people who die from gaming incidents already in the modern age. To some people a virtual reality world would have more of an appeal to someone leading to a decline in their mental and physical health. Simply put its not something I would wish on the world as a casual gamer. I liked SAO for the most part but it was just put up a little higher than it deserved but I still enjoyed it.",7
"
                It had potential but blew it..
This may contains spoilers
Story 5/10 : Why 5 ? The main reason of this is the big flop at the 12th episode.. 
The idea of being trapped in a video game was an awesome idea, this is why I first watch the anime. But sadly, this thing lasts only 14 episodes.
The second arc is really unnecessary, it's basically what ruined the whole anime for me. Starting with a ""warriror"" thing to end with a fairy thing.. Just WTH ?!
Art & Sound: 8/10  At least, the chara-design and the soundtrack were good.
Characters : 5/10 Well, during the 1st arc, I'd
                  give a 9/10, but the 2nd.. Kirito.. Crying all the the time.. just no.. And the SM hair fetishist guy.. *facepalm*
Enjoyment : 5/10 Like for the characters, I enjoyed the 1st arc, but the 2nd, I just forced myself to watch the end of this anime..
Overall : The 1st arc was perfect and it probably be better if it was the only arc..
The 2nd arc is just a waist..
Without the 2nd arc, I'd probably give a 8-9/10",5

                I'm going to keep this about as short and sweet as possible. 
If you judge an anime based on it's overall mal rating, for this anime, don't. I had no idea sao was ranked at 273 as of now. That is an astronomically high figure for the actual quality of the show. Sao is worth at most 1000-1500. The only redeeming quality of this anime is the art. Also the fact that all perverted male teens are attracted to heterosexually cliched romance. Anyway, in short, The characters are grossly written; especially the female characters. Actually really though. No female character is written to any higher
                  degree than ""Wow, this unattractive simpleton is for whatever unholy reason kinda hot and I think I'm in love!"" The story is also unoriginal and bland. 
I will now summarize this review with a series of adjectives that describe sao:
Cliched
Sad (no actually it makes me sad thinking i spent time watching this)
Unoriginal
Boring
Inferior
Painful
Average
Trite
Atrocious
Cute (the art and shitty romance)
Heterosexual
Pathetic
BAD
Thank you. Bring on the downvotes.",3

                With the beginning of the second season which is coming up soon, I thought I'd write a little review about SAO. My god this'll be horrible. Don't get me wrong, I love this anime, I simply dom't wanna rate it lower than i feel about it. But it cannot be helped. 
Story: The story is one of the biggest cockteases I have ever seen in my life. It starts out soo promising, with a vesry strong opening and first arch, but ultimately carries on way too fast with too many sideplots and simply boring archs (Talking about the honeymoon arch) to actually make it possible
                  for the viewer to enjoy the mainplot. But all of that could be forgotten if the whole story didn't go bullocks after the first half of the anime. I really enjoyed SAO with it's lolicons and it's whatevers but the second half, ALO, was boring, predictable and stupid. Though I have to mention the awesome setting of SAO. That was it. 4/10
Art: Now this is one of the two things where SAO shines. The artstyle is beatiful, with interesting settings (though one is a little too girly) which really give the feeling as if they really are in a mmorpg. Characterdesigns are awesome, every piece of armor having that typical medieval but still japanese adapted style to them taht people love about mmorpgs, which spawned a million SAO cosplays over the past two years. The monster designs are interesting but not too surprising or innovative. But hey, it's a mmorpg, what do you expect :D. The dungeons between the ""maps"" are the most interesting part of the environment, especially the ""Zebra"" dungeon. But the crown jewel of this anime are the action scenes, especially the bossfights being so well coregraphed and beatiful-looking that you wish you were a part of them. 9/10
Ps: But the most important part of the art is....
Sound: ...that it's in prefect sync with the beatiful soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura. The opening is maybe a little girly but nevertheless good for a few hours of repetetive listening while playing WoW, Aura kingdom, Guild Wars or whatever you like to play. but the opening is nothing compared to the well timed medieval soundtracks in the towns, the highly orchestral pieces out on the fields, inside dungeons and in bossfights. Seriously, you feel, sorry for being repetetive, as if you are in an mmorpg. I know I say that too often but I think that's what the soundtrack and the art should deliver here. 9/10
Character: Again, this is one strike to the balls (Or the ovaries, depending on which gender you are). Let's go through them chronologically: Kirito, the main character, is a lone wolf who somehow manages, by being a total dick toards most people, creating a harem. No idea what the girls see in him: ""OOh, he's soo alone but he actually looks okay and he's cool because he's the only one wearing black. I think I want to f*** him"". Something like that. It's just soo unrealistic, especially in the world of gaming. Moving on: Asuna. She's the incarnation of this whole anime. Really awesome first half, shitty second half. She seriously has negative character development, evolving from a very interesting, independent and stong female character to your generic moe blob that can't do anyting without her bf. This is a sad day for female leading roles.......anyways next: The Harem consists of a lot of uninspired female characters whose archs are mainly solved within one episode, including the shy scared one, the hyper one, the one you wish to be your little siste, the actual little sister and the ....daughter?! Ehh, I'll be honest....I love Yui because she's the only haremgirl that neitehr want to fuck him nor want to be his wife. She simply loves Kirito and Asuna and I think that's something awesome, though her arch was boring as fuck. Also, her voice is by Kanae itou.....I love Kanae Itou........anyways there are still a lot of characters to go, but I don't want to refelct on all fo them. The first villain is awesome, the second one is not. The first love is awesome(at least in the first half), the second one is not.(Leafa/Suguha was forced into this anime way too much)
I love the fact that they even included this background dude that actually acted like he was a girl but then turns into the 30 year old creep :D
The last thing I must mention that it's awesome to see how the gamers are completely perplexed and mentally crushed after they heard that they are stuck in the game and slowly develop to find a liking to SAO and it's daily life, much different than Log Horizon f/e where everyone except for the maincast falls into a deep depression and the maincast is just like ""So....we're stuck in this game, huh? Okay."". Realistic, but overall mediocre. 5/10
Now my personal Enjoyment: I really liked this anime and I enjoy rewatching it every three months. It has some fatal flaws and yes, the long awaited OVA was just a beach episode with Asuna having a stupid haircolor which made me think of her as Nerine from Shuffle! the whole time but taht doesn't matter. I don't know why, but I'd recommend this anime to anyone, though I realise it has some really great faults and stupidities and so on, but....this is it. This is the dream many of us had for years: Being able to live in a game, I would seriously give up all i have to do that and I think that's why I love this anime so much. Enjoyment 8/10
Well, this results in an overall 7/10, there are some animes out there that are a lot better, but no one who enjoys playing videogames can deny that this is a dream. A dream that will hopefully come true soon enough for us to still enjoy it. I think that is also why there are so many people in the community that call this the best anime ever without taking any criticism: Because they don't want their dreams to be crushed. So everyone out there who reads this: Don't be to harsh one those who believe this is one of the best anime ever.",7
"
                Now, before I start, if you're a hater, go ahead read this, but I'm not gonna overly hate this, but I'm also not going to say, ""OMG! I love SAO!!!"" or anything fanboyish, but I'm going to bring out a positive view on this anime, so hater, fanboy or maybe even the rare newbie of anime, go ahead, I welcome you to read this. I'm gonna try to point out common negatives and positives without getting meticulous. So where do we start...
Story: Alright, alright, I know, plot was nonexistent, pretty much that is. The idea was actually not that bad, people stuck in a MMORPG
                  where if they die there, they die in real life. Not that bad, huh? Well they kinda slaughtered it. I'm gonna give them some brownie points for being able to fit some what of a good story line in the first and last few (at least they attempted to go back on track, too many side adventures) episodes. Any one who watches this anime normally comes out saying it was rushed, which it was. In 14 short episodes, they tried to fit in a story, romance, action, adventure, etc. and did an alright job but went way far off focus on everything and put all effort into useless side adventures. This entire idea, being trapped in a game of death, could have been stuck in 50 episodes, making the anime much better by far in my opinion. There are points where are MC (I'll get to him later) is on one floor and level, then the very next episode is at least 15 floors up and probably an extra 20 levels at that! Where the hell did levels 50-70 go? I'll bring up Character Development in a second because that has a lot to do with how quickly this show moved on. Oh yeah, if you can't handle some cliche lines and actions, I'd suggest getting away. There are parts where I couldn't handle some things, along with some WTF? moments. Episode 2: Guy dies rather than taking a simple healing potion... WTF? Take that stuff and get back up! Then Kirito takes blame for what happened with the beta testers and becomes a beater, which is quite heroic, because if you actually look into the contexts, he's saving all the other beta tester's asses (What he said isn't true, he's just trying to help his fellow BT from getting harassed). Back on the story, oh wait, we can't go back because we have to stick in 10 episodes of side stories that get in the way. There are way to many! Characters that never make a needed appearance are added and waste the precious time this anime needed! C'mon man! Get it together and go beat some bosses in your spare time! As much as they wasted time, some of the adventures were nice to see, but also extremely weird at the same time, its a jumbled mess, that's what it is.
Overall: 5/10 Anime was really rushed, not enough time put into it at all, side stories aren't really needed. They tried, tripped, fell on their face, but get some points for a good first 2 episodes and actually attempting to do something at all. Everything smashes together and becomes a mess.
Art: Scenery in this. Wow. You gotta admit, it's pretty impressive. Good views of landscape, mountains, tress, lakes, sun, most large scaled views are quite nice.They actually are calming and peaceful in my own opinion. But in terms of the art animation, it's a bit iffy. At moments, people bodies seem disproportional and not really fit to themselves. Sometimes, I think I've seen duplicate characters, there's no individualism, like everyone sorta looks the same exact way. The only other thing are the battle scenes. Sometimes I hate them, sometimes I love them. I've seen elongated limbs and awkward body positions that don't seem quite right. Sometimes there are shot screen battles, but really aren't as bad as people say they are, most of the battles are actually really good with somewhat smaller details that would even make them look slightly mediocre. Other than that, the battles are epic, intensified looks, nice looking attacks, that don't really look repetitive at all, and a general satisfaction feeling to see them, appealing to the eye. 
Overall: 9/10 Excellent scenery, but at a couple of moments, things just look weird but aren't very noticeable. 
Sound: Music is amazing, well timed, and if you actually listened somewhat, just normal sounds are sharp and not very dull or boring. 
Overall: 10/10 Good stuff, makes you feel rather than just hear.
Character: Oh boy, here we go. Kirito! Rather than what you've probably heard, he's quite likable if you're accepting enough. Alrighty, now if you don't know what an introvert is I suggest you look it up because here's a very good example of one! Quite, somewhat socially awkward, doesn't really always know what to say at given times, but holds a lot of anger and heart inside of him. Like some introverted people, if you unleash the beast, well you might just be screwed. If you can understand his position, you will understand Kirito. He's a solo player, but just because of that does that mean he's going to just let people die? No he's a good person, and in that world, it's pretty much life or death, so it's easy to see his good intentions. Here's the issue: he doesn't really seem to have any flaws, none, zip, zero, nada. Along with his partner Asuna, they're perfect teenagers. Kind, good, smart, helpful, anything that sounds good, you got these main characters. Also bring in the fact he gets pretty much anything he want, ehh things aren't really complicated for our MC here. Well yeah, they tried to make things seems difficult with the ""I don't want you to die"" and ""I don't want to leave you"" or even the ""Lets live together forever, but we need to save everyone from this game"", but it didn't really fit in as a real major conflict. Now, Asuna is a whole different... actually exact same thing as Kirito, strong, powerful, except she's an extrovert and is more of a leader. But nonetheless they have the same ideas and plan implied into them, be good to others, become stronger, win the game. I must say, I really didn't want to complain about the characters much, they were nice, good, nothing really wrong with them, so by themselves they are pretty good. Oh yeah, Character development. None whatsoever. Everything just went too quickly and, ugh... it's no fun to see everything move that fast. 
Overall: 8/10 The characters aren't that bad, just a bit too perfect with little development.
Side Characters: Well I think they deserve their own section so here it is. First of all, development isn't too much of an issue here. These guys aren't that important but add just a little to the story. Sachi, Silica, and Lizbeth aren't really needed at all. Sachi does eventually motivate Kirito even harder but still not necessary. Silica only eased his pain about his sister. And Lizbeth, well she didn't do crap. The stupid part is that they all fall for him eventually, but not more of the love a first sight, but more gradual, which is better, but still, they all started to like Kirito. Lizbeth when she met Kirito was probably a better addition to the story than a Liz that liked him. Of course, Kirito being who he is, even the watcher of the anime wouldn't expect him to always be on the lookout for a girlfriend. Now on the plus side, we got Agil, Klein, and look at that, even Heathcliff. Agil added another dimension of friendship which tags along nicely with Kirito's attitude. Klein has somewhat of a humorous attitude that is displayed nicely with the story, which loosens up some tension. Heathcliff looks immediately like a leader, and it is easy to see his strength. All three of these side characters add appropriately to the story, and all seem fairly stable and easy to connect with while the three girls don't make much of a difference, but it is noticeable. (No, I'm no sextist, it's actually what I think)
Overall: 8.5/10 Not really as bad as everyone says, side stories not needed, but most of the side characters add nicely to build Kirito. 
Enjoyment: Trust me, there may be a lot of things to point out that are somewhat to really bad, this is a good anime. It's nice, if you can emotionally connect, you'll enjoy it, there's no real reason not to like it. It is quite addicting, and very nice to watch and is appealing to the eye. If you can't adapt to things quickly or can only take your time, this isn't for you. But if you can follow a story where ever it goes and actually appreciate what it is and how it works, this is one of the better anime out there. 
Overall: 8/10 It's not for everyone, but I would recommend it, its a fun thing to watch on occasion, and if you are new to anime, this is a fun and exciting starter to see, not something a major critic should watch and contemplate over. 
Final
Story: 5/10
Art: 9/10
Sound 10/10
Character: 8/10
Enjoyment: 8/10
Overall: 8/10 Nice anime, needs more time to get everything in motion and should have took more time, that's the main reasons for its faults really. The only thing that kills it is the story, but if you can appreciate the show in itself, it actually if one of the better anime you could find. Not for extreme anime critics, but appealing to the eyes of almost all others. I would recommend Sword Art Online, I personally enjoyed it, although it isn't perfect, it's still a very good anime.
*If I see anything that should be added or fixed, I will update this, as well as add things as the series carries on*",8

                Now, here comes another review for Sword Art Online! Well, mostly. After receiving positive comments for my SAO II review about the guts I had to even post one, let alone an enjoyable review, I am now tackling the beginning and first adaptation of the SAO series. Hopefully, this review is different enough to appeal to both lovers and haters, anime newcomers and veterans, and anyone who doesn't fit into those very broad categories.
Now onto my review of Sword Art Online, a two part, side-by-side comparison. Why? Well, let's proceed, shall we?
Story: 6.8 (Sword Art Online Arc)
The first half of the series fields a fairly
                  good story, all matters aside. It has a great introductory episode, an okay but slightly confusing followup, and then a typical, and unfortunately rushed narrative. Take all of what I said before, and the story for me is a 5.5. But what makes it’s a 6.8 are the side-stories. Mind you, not the supporting character introductions, but rather the more psychological, technological, and series defining aspects. To better understand my POV, look at every novel in the SAO series starting from the Gun Gale Online arc, where Reki Kawahara finally begins to realize the value of what makes this series special, and more precisely, all of his novels beginning with Mother's Rosario onwards, including his reboot of the original series, SAO :Progressive. The three episodes that showcase these characteristics are ""The Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Murder in the Safe Zone “, and “Illusionary Avenger”. These episodes really are what makes SAO so appealing, both as a show to watch and a hypothetical case study. Without revealing any other details, let’s just say Kawahara finally learned how to utilize these elements very well beginning with Mother’s Rosario. Only because of them, do I believe the story is a 6.8. These episodes on their own are around a 7.6, with some of the best writing in the series, mainly because they were actually written much later than the actual narrative, but nonetheless, being paired with the “okay”, illogical, over-dramatic, mood-swinging, and very fun to watch narrative, as well as the “meh” character introduction episodes, SAO’s story isn’t terrible— It just isn't anything close to the top tier such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. 
Story: 5.2 (Fairy Dance Arc)
The second half of the anime has three good things. Real life interactions and immediate impacts, continuation of the technological case study, and a satisfying, if not provocative ending. This arc, out of all future and current arcs, seems destined to be the worst reviewed and weakest. The introduction of Kirito’s cousin and her own experience with virtual reality was actually very nice, as it revealed how her own foray into the virtual world was what Kirito’s could have been if not for the SAO incident. Her own real life training with her brother was a surprising and fun to watch sequence, drawing Kirito in his SAO fighting prime life back into the real world and how it would be different. But everything else can be seen as a failure. Asuna is reduced to a helpless maiden, who Kirito has to save, and a certain character forms a disastrous and inane love triangle.  The side characters play little to no part in the arc compared to secondary characters of the first arc, and have little to no mention in SAO II. Asuna has to deal with a sexually-driven and mediocre villain, with the ending of the arc cruelly featuring the once powerful battle commander as an adult toy. The best parts are how SAO is present technologically in the game, and how virtual reality could be used as safe tool for study of the human brain and mind. If not for the conclusive yet series continuing ending, which was much better than the first arc’s, this arc could easily be rated a 4.8 instead. It is what it is, but it is always good to know that Kawahara learned and improved from his faults in his later novels.
Art and Sound: 9.7 (Sword Art Online and Fairy Dance Arcs)
This is where SAO, and even beats out its successor series. The grand entrance to virtual reality, the distortion effect and sounds, the character action, both active and inactive, and the intense battles and atmosphere SAO provided was outstanding. With a very good opening from LiSA, and great voice actor castings, SAO, in both arcs, outclassed most of the other anime of 2012, and many other popular ones, due to A-1 Pictures’ amazing job on the series. It’s what kept the story so vivid for many anime newcomers, and what maintained the respect of critics. 
Character: 5.5 (Sword Art Online Arc)
Easily the biggest and most negatively critiqued aspect of the series, with equal parts adoration and hatred. SAO, as good of a series that it is, fails with its characters. The two lead protagonists, Kirito and Asuna, are the biggest examples. Throughout the main narrative, Kirito is seen as cocky and emotionless, until he suddenly changes to emotional and caring for the rest of the arc. Asuna goes from scared and nervous, to shy and passive, to powerful and caring, to weak and dependent, all in one arc. With such random changes to characters, the basis of this all falls on the story. Being a single novel, SAO is a very rushed arc that begins with the first few months of SAO, before then promptly jumping to the last two weeks. This provides no character growth at all for the leads, and paired that with the better side stories, causes random shifts in their behaviors. The side characters are no better. Klein is introduced in the first episode, and is handled remarkably well, but is then forgotten, only reappearing in the side stories and as a background character for main narrative. Agil is introduced pretty well in the second episode, along with Asuna, but he remains the least developed character of SAO. The side stories introduce Lisbeth and Silica, two supporting characters, and effectively wraps up their value in significance, which very little to the story, in single episodes, only being mentioned off and on. Without solid leads, and a lack of secondary character usage in the arc, SAO leaves itself vulnerable to very negative critiques, and rightly so. Along with the weak secondary characters comes the love group, or harem, that Kirito forms, with little to no reason, and actually diminishes the relationship of Asuna and Kirito. However, seeing as this is a review created during the last episodes of SAO II, I have to admit one wish. SAO: Progressive, an effective retelling and reboot of the Aincrad arc, has done well with establishing the personalities of Kirito that the series later reveals, which the anime actually doesn’t feature. With a more detailed story, and good character development for Kirito and Asuna in the first 3 volumes, I expect to also see the secondary characters be better handled throughout the story, become more integrated, and also explored in ways the anime never could attempt because of lack of material. Other than that, the first arc in its current shape fields a mediocre group, who, likeable as they are, won’t be considered a good cast unless SAO: Progressive effectively recreates them and a possible anime adaption is created on it. 
Character: 4.3 (Fairy Dance Arc)
With mediocre characters already to begin with in SAO, things only get worse in ALO, the VRMMO of SAO’s Fairy Dance Arc. Suguha, Kirito’s cousin, is the only notable character introduced, as she becomes part of the main cast and is a fairly likeable character, if not for a certain terrible romantic plot that effectively has not been repaired for any fan of SAO. The secondary characters of SAO are all missing in the second arc, with only Kirito, Asuna and their SAO child/fairy Yui returning. Kirito has absolutely no character development, as the mad-in-love hero tries to do the impossible in another VRMMO and save his beloved. Asuna is tortured, but not as a strong-willed heroine deserves to be, but rather as a toy for Noboyuki, the disgusting, disturbing, and sadly realistic lecher. The other side characters are gone within minutes, and only are there for more fan-service and drawn-out battles. With a forgettable story that both isn’t buoyed by its cast and a story that weakens its cast, Fairy Dance effectively adds unneeded character elements, that are fortunately removed for the most part from the rest of the series.
Enjoyment 9.5 (Sword Art Online and Fairy Dance Arcs)
The reason this part of the review is combined, other than the obvious reasons for Animation and Sound, is because enjoyment of the whole adaptation is something I think has to be considered. SAO is a very sloppy anime, with extreme lows and highs, consistent with the material it uses, and overall an okay anime. But the fact is it’s enjoyable, for the novice and for the veteran. For a novice, like myself a few years ago, the amazing sound, animation were the two things that convinced me to watch anime, and the outstanding choreography and battle sequences, faithful to the Kawahara’s writings and yet even better than what’s provided. For a veteran, the guilty feeling of watching something that looks so good can’t be denied, even if what actually occurs isn’t itself anything noteworthy. SAO earns a 9.5 in Enjoyment because, though it fails to deliver its best aspects and manages to twists and complicate its often silly story, it is fun to watch, but for guilty entertainment and simple animation joy.
Overall: 7.6
SAO was a good anime. It was enticing, aggravating, awe-inspiring, and disgusting in a small span of 24 episodes. For the show’s lovers, every episode was worth watching, and for the haters, every episode was worth a rant. And yet, both sides watched the series for their own reasons. As someone who enjoyed SAO, and appreciates its two years on, the show was a success in my book for its great side stories with their technological and psychological elements, which Kawahara now fully embraces, and for the fact it drew a large amount of people to watch it and other anime from then on. SAO is no “creation of perfection”, and neither is it a “steaming pile of shit”. It is a decent anime, that should be watched and remembered like others for years to come for its globally-altering effect. I hope that if you read this long-winded review, that you found it thoughtful and a nice read. Thanks everyone!",7

                I want to start off by saying, even if you have read some bad reviews and are turned off, I strongly encourage you to at least give Sword Art Online a try. It does have its flaws but just because those imperfections are there doesn't mean you can't sit back and enjoy it, which many end up doing and which you might. Many enjoy it for the entertainment rather than for a strong message or strong plot. So I say at least watch the first three episodes before deciding whether to drop or not.
Okay going into the review. 
Story: The concept is cool. Trapped in
                  a game with the possibility of death. Who wouldn't be anxious, worried and completely terrified? It's fun to think about and is what immediately grabs much of the audience. We do end up drifting away from this and getting lost in a romance, which I do have a problem with and will talk more about in the character portion.  8/10.
Art: The art is crisp and modern, the scenery is beautiful and the fight scenes are superb. 10/10
Sound: Kirito's voice actor is probably one of the top two best voice actors I have ever heard. The sounds he makes when he fights and the noises he makes when he cries... just... wow A+. Also, the OSTs are beautiful and heartfelt and the opening and end songs are very enjoyable. 10/10
Character: Here is where I find the majority of the problem in my opinion (although, the plot straying into a romance is part of the problem as well). There are three episodes where Kirito has a story with three different girls. Episode 3 with Sachi, Episode 4 with Silica and Episode 7 with Liz. Episode 3, contrary to what other reviewers say, is my favorite episode and I think it truly stresses the situation of being trapped in a death game. These three girls I feel like are 100% more realistic than Asuna is and Asuna is the main female protagonist who appears in MANY of the episodes while the other girls only get ONE episode. Asuna to me is an extremely flat character. She is perfect in every way. She is your strong female character who is incredibly fast with her sword. She's beautiful and her character development is one minute she's sharp but she immediately softens in like one episode. The problem I have is that Asuna is not real. She has absolutely no flaws. Kirito and her fall in love almost instantly, literally in one episode they go from partners to lovers. And she actually becomes a damsel in distress. There is no smooth transition of her changing, she just automatically loves Kirito and is automatically this perfect girl for him. All she is is fanservice and her and Kirito's love seems very artificial and spontaneous. I much rather have had Sachi, Silica and Liz alongside Kirito than Asuna. I even love Suguha (Kirito's ""sister"") more than Asuna because she is realistic, she goes through things that many of us have, she is pained, she is troubled, she feels real and she feels sincere while Asuna is an unrelatable blank slate. Because I enjoyed all the characters except Asuna 7/10
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this so much. I was hype every week to watch a new episode, I was cheering, I was crying, I was happy and I was angry. The drama is great and the fights get you pumped.  Even the flaws made it enjoyable because overall I had a great time yelling at my computer screen. 10/10
Overall: 8/10
*~ I have read some chapters of the light novel and I can already say that the light novel discusses the features of the game more in-depth than the anime does. The anime tried to fit two volumes of the light novels into one season, so this is probably why the romance is highlighted more because they just couldn't fit everything in. I suggest reading the light novels if you are more interested in the gaming aspect.",8

                Sword Art Online was a light novel series written by Kawahara Reki. It was adapted into an anime by A-1 Pictures, the same studio that brought us Valkyria Chronicles, Kuroshitsuji and Shin Sekai Yori. It's also proven to be a pretty divisive series, some people loving it others hating it. My friends who have seen it are pretty evenly split on the matter. So, as you can probably imagine, I've heard a few arguments about it. Which side is more accurate? 
Story: 
Our story opens with the release of a highly anticipated virtual reality game, the titular Sword Art Online. Our protagonist, Kirigaya Kazuto (player
                  name Kirito) is one of ten thousand players to log in. He has an advantage having been one of the beta testers. That's when things get serious. The game's creator, Kayaba Akihiko, traps all of the players inside the game with no way to log out. To make matters worse, their nerve gear devices will cause their deaths if forcibly removed by someone in the real word and if they die in the game, they will die in reality. The only way to return to the real world is to beat all 100 floors of SAO. 
In all fairness, that premise is really promising and could have been really interesting. The problem is that the execution is shoddy. Kayaba has no real motivation. You eventually do learn why he did it, but his actions don't logically follow from it. There is absolutely no reason that, with the motivation given, he should trap players in the game or kill them. The minor villains are just as bad. Apparently, in this game of life and death with only ten thousand players, there are enough sociopaths to form a PKing guild. It, frankly, doesn't ring true in the slightest. Even the biggest jerks out there would be far more likely to cooperate with other players if only to save themselves, than to try and murder them.
The series also suffers from major time skips. I get that there are a lot of floors to go through, but if there was nothing interesting to do with the vast majority of their progress, why would you set the upper limit that high? The vast majority of the time skips just serve as a lazy plot device to avoid having actual character development. Instead they show something happen, skip ahead to something else and character relationships have changed however the story needed them to. They don't have to explain it because several months passed. The attempts at drama also suffer as a result. There are several cases where they'll introduce a character, kill them off at the end of the episode, treat it as a dramatic event and then never mention them again. Seriously, if you want us to care about a character you have to actually develop them as a character or make their death matter in some way. Then we have the “romance” aspects. Our two leads have basically no chemistry and girls seem to flock to our protagonist for no real reason. I get the impression that Kawahara just wanted to incorporate harem elements.
As I said the execution is pretty shabby, until the second arc. In the second arc we get a new villain with actual motivations and the story also gets much, much worse. They introduce Kirito's sister as a major character and she has an incestuous crush on him. Did I mention that this is the same studio behind the second series of the repulsive OreImo? Okay, so she's really just his first cousin who he was raised with as siblings, that doesn't make it any less disgusting. Seriously, either of those would make this a really gross turn in its own right why would combining the two make it somehow okay? Our action girl heroine is also reduced to being a damsel in distress. The series uses that fact to introduce creepy non-consensual sexual stuff, which it doesn't even come close to handling well. 
Characters:
The characters in this are mostly just dull. They fit a basic trope and never move out of it. Asuna is your typical action girl. The various supporting characters are pretty much non-characters who are defined by one or two traits, which is a pretty serious issue when they try to make one of their deaths dramatic. Our major antagonists are the generic villain with vague motivations and the obvious sociopath, who somehow avoids detection. Kirito is your stock dumb nice guy protagonist. His stupidity can get annoying, though. This is a guy who seriously tries to argue that sacrificing the re-spawning NPCs in order to advance is wrong. Sugu is probably the worst with her major defining characteristic being that she wants to romance her own brother. 
ART: 
The art is mostly pretty good. It has some really creative aspects and the online world is portrayed in a pretty dynamic way. The fight scenes flow pretty well too. The biggest problem with the art is the propensity towards fan-service. This series seriously has gratuitous fan-service shots of a girl who isn't even in High school, including a bathing scene, a random shot that puts the focus on her bum and a scene of her in her undergarments. The whole objectifying women to provide fan-service aspect is bad enough when the character in question is a grown woman, but when she's a recent Middle School graduate it just gets into really despicable territory. 
Sound: 
The acting in this isn't very good. The lines tend to be either exaggerated or listless. There are a few good acting moments, but they're few and far between. They got some good actors, they just didn't give them anything to work with. The music is the best part of the series. It isn't anything special, but it's okay.
Ho-Yay:
The Ho-yay factor is a 2/10. There's one scene where Klein offhandedly says that Kirito is his type but they never do anything with it. They don't even clarify whether it was serious or a jest on Klein's part. 
Final Thoughts: 
Sword Art Online is a classic example of a good premise being decimated by the execution, which goes from slipshod in the first arc to unpleasant and downright nasty in the second. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting conveys that. All in all it's a series that starts out pretty mediocre and takes a very sharp downward spiral. My final rating is going to be a 2/10. Next week, Shingeki no Kyojin.",2
"
                Sword Art Online- this anime has been getting insane amounts of attention from Japan and many other countries. If you've never watched it, you've most likely heard of it. After a while of thinking, I've finally decided to do a review on this.
Just warning you; if you're a Sword Art Online fan, you may find this review offensive- and that is because I am not a fan of Sword Art Online, although I am far from a hater of it, too.
Story- 4
A teenage boy who's a ""Hikikomori"" (Japanese for a shut in) named Kirigaya Kazuto buys the new video game called ""Sword Art Online"", an
                  MMORPG. It is not just a regular MMORPG, though- you have to buy another program called the ""Nervegear"", which allows you to be in the game itself. Our main character, Kirigaya, goes into the game of Sword Art Online.
 Just as he's starting to have fun, though, he realizes there is no log out button and assumes it's a glitch. It actually isn't, though- the creator of the game informs them that it is there on purpose, and they cannot get back to real life now. They are stuck in Sword Art Online forever- that is, until someone beats the 100 floors/levels which are all increasingly difficult. Also, the players will take damage in not only the game but in real life, and can die in the game. If someone unplugs their ""Nervegear"", they die immediately.
So, there is basically no escape.
Sounds interesting, right? I thought it was at first too- actually, I still do think it is. But that's the problem with this anime- the idea of it is cool, which is why the first 3 episodes of the anime were fantastic, but that's about it.
Which is sad to say, because when the first few episodes came out I had great hope for this anime- hell, even after the first arc was over I still held a bit of a torch for it.
 As soon as it's done being introduced, the anime starts gradually going downhill. The plot is bland and predictable with no interesting turns or twists; They had great potential with the idea of this anime, but used it in a cliched, boring fashion.
The first arc of this series was alright, although a bit boring- but the second arc was what really made it deserve a four. The overuse of fanservice to keep you ""glued to the seat""; the ""damsel in distress"" plot used once more; it was honestly very disheartening.
The only thing about the plot I can commend is the battle scenes- they were very well written and kept me entertained. But, otherwise, the writing seemed very immature and uninteresting. I felt as though romance was the main thing that kept this anime going, which is odd because it has the label ""shounen"" and is an action anime.
There were also plenty of plot holes and questionable moments; for example, in the last episode when Kirito uses this ""super power"" type of fighting that he never had before. There was even a moment where he was SPOILER: dead but came back to life for no reason?
Art- 8
One of the key reasons that Sword Art Online is popular is it's artwork- the animation was really fantastic and breath taking at times, and the characters had great, interesting designs. The art style was average, but still very pretty and eye-catching.
If it weren't for this and the sound, I would've given Sword Art Online a lower score. But, if I can say one thing great about this anime it would be definitely about the animation. This is definitely in my top ten list of best animation from anime in 2012. The only problem is that art and sound are not what makes an anime good.
Sound- 9
Like the artwork, the sound was flawless most of the time. The voices were great for the characters, the background music was surprisingly noticeable (unlike most anime) and the openings and endings were very catchy.
Character- 3
What I found even worse than the plot was the characters. Their designs are very eye-catching, but their personalities were very bland, cliched, and ""Mary Sue""-like. For example, the main character, who mainly goes by his username ""Kirito"", is portrayed as a shut-in. Most people would look down in him in disgust, and most shut-ins have major problems. But not Kirito- all the girls around him at one point fall in love with him, and the only personality traits he has are brave and ""bad ass"". Along with this, he has ridiculous power in fighting for no reason. He has absolutely no flaws and never fails. Very boring.
Also, one girl named ""Asuna"" is shown as mysterious, cool and ""bad ass"" at first, but ends up being a stereotypical tsundere with no other personality trait except for brave.
All the characters have strikingly similar personalities, which makes none of them really stand out.
Enjoyment- 5
The only times I really enjoyed the anime was the first arc's battle scenes- those were beautifully illustrated and acted out, and were heart-racing. But, other wise, I felt as if the series dragged on and on with nothing interesting going on, especially in the second arc. 
The second arc, you couldn't even watch a battle scene without boobs 24/7- it was really ridiculous. I'm sure even some guys got sick of seeing one character's pair of boobs every 2 minutes. I felt as if the only thing that kept the series going was actually the fanservice. In one part, they even added tenticals- and aired this on tv...
Overall- 6
This anime is good if you're looking for a timewaster- but if you're looking for something with great plot, I really suggest not watching it.
The only really good part of this anime was arc 1, and the only really good part of it was the beginning. Afterwards, it gets very aggravating and I actually had to force myself to watch the second arc, and when it was over I felt great relief- not at the ending, but just because it was over.",6
"
                Story: The story starts off promising, but just turns out to be a cliché romance.
Its the future. Video game technology has become so advanced that u can literally play a game using your mind alone. 
A hyped up jrpg arrives, (named sword art online).
However, not everything is as it seems. The evil creator of the game made it so that you will be forever trapped in this virtual world unless someone beats it, and the most disturbing fact is that if you die in the game you die in real life.
We go through the life of kirito (or kazuto, kirito is his avatars name) as
                  he tries to beat the game and ultimately end up in real life again.
However, halfway through the anime he falls in love with a fellow female player, Asuna. Aaaand the hunger games like anime gets replaced by a cliché romance which is cometely unbelievable. 
Seriously.
Not only is the relationship stupid and unbelievable, its also boring. They are basically a perfect couple. All you see them doing in the first half of the show is flirt with one another. They have no chemistry. They have no arguments whatsoever. Its ridiculous. It's basically an anime version of twilight.
And even twilight has a better love story. They actually have problems with their relationship. 
So basically the rest of the first arc is just episodes about kirito and asunas romance.
Don't even get me started with the second arc of the anime. Basically, to save asuna, kirito needs to go through an RPG with fairies. Oh, and did I mention that all the female fairies want to have sex with him? No, did I? That makes the second arc more sickening to watch.
Long story short, the story had a lot of potentially but it got executed poorly.
Mark:2
Art:
Pretty damn good. The art and animation look gorgeous but the character designs are pretty generic and they look the same in most other anime. The art really connects with the beautiful scenery of the virtual world, and the animation is fantastic, especially
 in the action scenes, even though there aren't many of then.
Mark: 8
Sound: 
Great. Sao has a good variety of tracks, and many of then set the mood for the scene, whether its a peaceful romance or an adrenaline- pumping action scene, it all fits.
The openings are great too, along with the superb animation, making them a saving grace for the anime.
Mark: 8
Characters:
Easily the anime's weakest point. There is not one interesting or likable character in the entire series. 
Let's start with the main character. He's basically a Gary stu. He had no personality and he is BORING. 
He's just... PERFECT. 
He manages to defeat every enemy effortlessly by himself.
He gets all the ladies.
What he doesn't get is character development. He gets none. At all. Kirito is basically a wish fulfillment character for any stressed out male otaku/gamer because he is a loser who actually becomes a hero and a chick magnet.
Introduced as a Gary stu, ends as a Gary stu.
Now we get our female lead, asuna.
She's basically a cliche love interest.
She's just princess peach.
She's a Mary stu. She had no depth in her personality and has no goal apart from kirito.
Ironically, she was introduced as pretty bad ass, but after she fell in love with our hero, she's just become princess peach. Now she just cooks for our main character.
Also, did I mention she was hot? No, I didn't. Oh well, she's really hot.
Buuut if she's so hot then why is she spending time with a loser like kirito and why is she playing a video game anyway.....
Just because someone's hot doesn't mean you'll like them. Same with asuna. Hot but has no personality at all.
Villains: none. There are no real villains. Both villains in the series are stupid and have no real intentions or plans.
They aren't meant to be taken seriously.
Sides: 
None. There are zero important side characters. All other males don't do anything, and the females just want sex with kirito. That's it. Literally.
Mark: 1
Enjoyment: What do you think? It's basically a poorly written romance with nothing going for it.
The art and sound can't make up for the abysmal characters and story.
Mark: 3
Verdict:
Sao had such a cool concept. If you passed it on to the creators of anime like fmab or something, then we'd definitely get a good anime 
But no. Just no.
The characters are non-existant and the story is utter crap. Yes, animation and art is good, but there are many anime with the same level of animation and sound.
Go watch those instead of this piece of crap.
Please, for the love of god, do not watch this piece of shit.

                **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
In case you haven't noticed by now, Sword Art Online is the most polarizing anime since Neon Genesis Evangelion; maybe even more polarizing. That is not hyperbole; SAO actually is that divisive. People will either put this show on the highest of pedestals and claim that it's the greatest masterpiece ever erected, or they will crucify it for being the most overhyped, flawed, inconsistent  piece of sh*t in anime history. Well newsflash anime fans: SAO does not deserve either one of those stigmas. The truth about SAO lies on a neutral ground; it must be watched without the sky-high expectations that the
                  fan base has given it in order to objectively review it. It has many strengths and many weaknesses; there is nothing about SAO that is just ""okay"". Every aspect of it is either very good or very poor, making it hard to review.
Plot: 3/10
In the near future, a Virtual Reality MMORPG video game called Sword Art Online has been released where players control their avatars with their bodies using a piece of technology called Nerve Gear. However, players soon discover they cannot log out of the game, as the game creator is holding them captive until they reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, the twist is that if they die in the game, they die in real life too.
As a fan of video games myself, the concept of SAO had my attention from the very start. However, the first few episodes set a poor tone for the series. SAO makes a pretty horrendous first impression by giving its first four episodes some of the most poorly paced and badly written content I've seen.  The first few episodes are supposed to capture the emotional trauma that the characters of the game are going through as they realize the situation that they are in, particularly the protagonist Kirito, which is exactly what they should have tried to do; however, it is executed terribly. Everything simply happens way, way too fast.  The audience is expected to develop emotional connections to characters that have been on screen for about ten minutes total, there are several time skips of significant length at inopportune times, and worst of all, the show expects you to believe that Kirito has undergone some sort of emotional transformation. Kirito, whose biggest problem is the fact that he is completely flawless (more on characters later), was clearly supposed to be dynamic and actually learn something or change from these first episodes, but they didn't spend half the time they needed to on this aspect of the plot to effectively portray Kirito's flaws. The lackluster nature of these four episodes end up dragging down the rest of the anime, all the way until the final episode, which is a shame.
Luckily, starting at around episode five, SAO finally starts to have an enjoyable plot when it enters its first real story arc; trying to clear the 100 floors of the tower and beat the game.  The element of suspense and knowing that characters who die are dead for good ends up being the driving force of the plot, and for a while, it works. The immersive atmosphere of the game is actually pretty enjoyable and it made for a more engrossing storyline then some people give the show credit for. 
The other main aspect that begins to develop is the romance between Kirito and the female lead; Asuna. The romance appears promising at first glance; two people who are going through difficult emotional times begin to rely on each other until they eventually fall in love. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two becomes increasingly unrealistic and feels less genuine as time goes on. This is because Asuna develops an unrealistic reliance on Kirito while Kirito is… well… perfect, as usual. It becomes less about the relationship between the two and more about Kirito being a badass and propping up the completely objectified Asuna, but again, more on characters later.
When SAO enters its second arc following a major plot twist, SAO really begins to go downhill fast. I can't elaborate on anything in the second arc due to spoilers, but here is the gist of it: the suspense of the first arc is nowhere to be found, nothing the characters do has any meaning anymore, an unbelievably uncomfortable side-plot is added, and the behavior of the characters becomes completely inconsistent and nonsensical. It is this second arc that completely sunk the plot of SAO and really took away any chance the show had of becoming a great anime. Really  the plot was just very poorly written.
Art: 10/10
Absolutely stunning, eyegasmic, breathtaking animation. The animation in SAO is maybe the absolute greatest I have seen in any anime I've ever watched. It's bright, colorful, crisp, fluent, and just plain beautiful. There is an argument to be made that SAO is worth watching for no other reason then to see this masterful artwork. Some of the most well-animated action scenes in history.
Sound: 8/10
A pretty great soundtrack. The first opening is very good and the in-show music is utilized very well. The voice acting is superb in both the sub and the dub. The sound in SAO is well above average.
Characters: 1/10
The characters are the worst aspect of SAO for reasons that are not hard to see. Even if you put aside the fact that the protagonist is a poorly written character, there is absolutely no excuse for the complete and total objectification of the female characters, which consist of about 80% of the remaining significant characters.
Let's start with the protagonist; Kirito. If you have seen one character like this, you have seen them all. Kirito is a perfect human being; he is purposely written to be ridiculously awesome so that the younger male viewers of the show (SAO's target demographic) will put themselves in Kirito's shoes. All the girls are falling in love with you for no reason, you are a total badass who can take anyone in a fight, etc. Kirito was made to pander to the male-power fantasies of the younger audience, so to be fair, SAO accomplished exactly what they wanted to with this character. Unfortunately for the rest of the audience who isn't in this demographic, Kirito is just irritating to watch. There is nothing special about him and yet the entire universe kneels and worships him as a God; it just makes absolutely no sense what so ever.
At first, Asuna seems like she might be the only female character who isn't treated as a object in the show, but much to my dismay, whatever integrity she may have had is stripped away in the blink of an eye and is further molested with each passing episode. In episode 21, the show hits absolute rock bottom in this regard (you know the scene I'm talking about, fans   -_-), and watching this process is just nauseating.  It's not just Asuna either; every female character that Kirito meets falls absolutely head over heels in love with him for no reason what-so-ever and proceeds to spend the remainder of their screen time swooning over him like the hopeless toolbags that they are. It is just downright insulting to women, and you don't have to be a female to be offended by that. SAO is a pretty good model of how NOT to write characters, particularly female ones; they have no real motivations or complexity at all.
Overall: 4/10
Does Sword Art Online live up to it's hype? No, it most certainly does not. However, if you watch it without sky-high expectations, MAYBE it could be worth your time; but only if you are someone who can appreciate truly masterful animation. Be prepared to suffer through a very poorly written plot and horribly written characters, should you decide to watch it. I don't recommend it, but hey, clearly a lot of people liked it.",4
"
                This is my first ever review, so bear with me if I don't sound as convincing.
SAO, for me, was alright. It wasn't a complete waste of my time nor was it the absolute best I've seen. I do not have regrets for watching this, but I can see why people have decided this anime to be less than average.
Story: 4/10
Honestly, the story wasn't all that great. It's basically your typical hero saves the world then finds the love of his life plot, and along the way he steals the hearts of other supporting female characters. The only reason why I'm tolerable with the story is
                  because of the whole Heathcliff business. 
Art: 9/10
An anime's art is quite a huge deal for me. It compels me to watch it since I'm in awe with the animation. If the art isn't as well done, then I may have a hard time trying to finish it. All that I can say is that you'll probably love the art as much as I do.
Sound: 9/10
Another one of SAO's perks, the soundtrack. ""Crossing Field"" really excited me. Even though I usually skip theme songs, I barely did so for SAO. It sparks the adventurous side of you and really thrills you in an inexpressible way. I guess you could say it makes you want to do something. (And we all know how hard it is to get motivated nowadays.) In conclusion, I'd say the art and sound are just about as great!
Characters: 3/10
The character plot is probably the most negative part of SAO. The main characters, with no particularly special background or personality that may link them together, fall in love for reasons unexplained. Their love seems undeveloped and rushed, like out of the blue they're suddenly a couple. Not only that, but the male lead is quite cliche in terms of his good qualities, such as kindness and determination, but that's pretty much it. He's just a gamer who manages to get some hot chicks in a virtual world. As for the minors or supporting characters, they seem like stepping stones for the male lead. They haven't any developed profiles, so it seems that their only use in the anime is to aid the hero in his quest for domination and freedom.
Enjoyment: 5/10
I'd say it was quite interesting to watch, even with the overly cliche plot. I rather liked Asuna and Yui, because they were just lovable in their own way. The SAO arc was probably the best and most enjoyable of all. If it weren't for the Alfheim arc, maybe this anime's ratings would be higher, because the honest truth is that Alfheim was utter bullcrap. Suguha pissed me off throughout the anime and don't even get me started on the psychotically, sadistic ""king"" of the damned game. 
Overall:
To be blunt, the only reason SAO gets a 6-7 rating from me is mostly because of its simply mesmerizing and captivating art and soundtrack. I suggest you watch SAO if you merely want some light enjoyment, because you ain't getting much from this.",6

                Life is harsh as a BETA tester in Sword Art Online. That's why I play solo. 
I've been trapped in this game for so long that I've lost track of time. Good thing the graphics for this game are pretty decent, or I'd probably commit suicide. I don't work well with shitty graphics.
I'm also starting to get the hang of being an elite solo player in this game. I for one, don't have many friends, or intend to make any, because they would probably impede my progress as an elitist. The benefit of being a BETA tester is the fact that I know all the
                  best ways to grind my levels. Call me a BEATER all you want, but I'm not dying in this crazy world.
There are some very interesting characters in this game. Agil for example, is this buff 6 feet 5 guy that likes to rip people off with his merchanting skills. We all look like our real life counterparts, so I don't get why this guy is not Pking or something. But he's a good and reliable friend nonetheless.
There's also a lot of hot girls in this game for some reason. I'm not complaining. I met this girl called Asuna, and wow she's good on the eyes. She's pretty strong as well, and all the nerds in Aincrad drools when they see her. I better not associate myself with her, as I like to stay low profile. However, she insists on bugging me all the time, but I actually don't mind after a while. The people in this game are pretty cool, I guess. But I'm the coolest.
I'd rate this game a 8/10. Could be higher if some floors weren't as easy as they currently are.",8
"
                I know, I'm a bit late on reviewing this one. But I had intended to write this review for quite a while. Sword Art Online was undoubtedly the most popular anime of 2012. It was one of those shows that took the anime world by storm and forced every anime fan to pick a side. No one cared about your opinion on if you're on the fence. So I refrained from talking about it too much in the forums. I kept switching sides as it was airing but neither bandwagon appealed to me in the end. So here is a review of Sword Art Online
                  from the perspective of someone who remained indecisive until the bitter end.
Sword Art Online is set in the near future where the first ever VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) named 'Sword Art Online' has been released. Through a device called 'Nerve Gear', people can control their avatars with their minds. Lead character Kirito is a hardcore gamer and beta tester for the game 'Sword Art Online'. After buying the game, he starts it up and is transported into the game fantasy world. Moments after starting, the creator of the game announces to all the players that the log out button has been disabled and they are trapped in that world. The only way to get out is to beat the game. 
However, there is a catch. If you die in the game, you die in real life. This catch adds a sense of danger which I welcomed at first. However, while it is emphasised a lot in the first few episodes, it soon fades into the background along with many other interesting ideas as the story twists and turns. Many of these twists and turns are what drags the show down. The story makes pretty much all the wrong choices when it comes to plot twists. Some of them I actually enjoyed like the romance element. But even they ended up becoming stale after just a few episodes. There's also a heavy use of other plot devices most notably being the use of deus ex machina. The lead characters are rarely in any real danger but pretty much every time they are, the battle almost always ends with some nonsensical plot device  that turns the tables and gives them the victory. In the end, there wasn't much I liked about the story. While it had potential, it was ruined by the writers' insistence on on plot devices and big twists in an attempt to spice up the story even when it's completely unnecessary.
However, not everything in the show is sub-par. A1 Pictures still brought their A-Game even when the source material wasn't so crash hot. Make no mistake, this is one very pretty show. From the imaginative fantasy themed backdrop to the highly detailed character designs to the proportions of a certain female character. The art never misses a beat. The animation is also very notable. One thing about this show I cannot fault is the amazing fight scenes. While quite rare, A1 proves that they can handle themselves even when tackling large scale fight scenes. They do a surprisingly good job given the small amount of action centric anime they make. But of course the animation is not without its faults. There are a few corners cut here and there and some weird facial expressions. But despite that, the visuals are solid. Probably much better than a show of this quality should have deserved.
As for the sound, Sword Art Online's score is handled by none other than Yuki Kajiura of Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero fame. While it's still a great score that definitely deserves a mention, it's not particularly memorable. I wouldn't listen to the OST on its own like with Madoka Magica. That being said, it still works very well in the context of the show. There were times where the score was so emotional that I was almost tricked into believing something amazing was going on screen and not some cheesy Twilight esque romance. With my extremely limited knowledge of the Japanese language I'd say that the voice work is solid. Although sometimes the characters overract to the point where their forced emotion transcends language barriers. But all in all, I'd say the voice acting is very much above the norm. Same with the amazing music. Especially 'Crossing Field'.
Although wish I could say the same for the characters. While I found the lead character Kirito interesting at first, I soon started to realise a pattern. Pretty much every time he was in a fight, he won. It's rare to find overpowered characters outside of shonen action. Especially in the modern age. It's even more out of place in a show like this which is meant to be aimed at a much older audience. But at the start of the show, Kirito is already an experienced player who can take on pretty much everyone without breaking a sweat. If his high skill level benefited the story, I would forgive it. However, it only works to hinder the sense of danger which originally drew me into this show. 
Female lead Asuna is also a victim of bad storytelling going from mysterious badass to bland love interest to damsel in distress and back to bland love interest in the end. The villains don't fair very well either. Kayaba Akihiko's intentions are or his reasoning behind his actions are never explained. Even worse is Sugou Noboyuki. The show tries way too hard to drive in just how evil the guy is. He's so evil that the other villain seems like a nice guy in comparison. At least, that's the reaction they wanted you to have. But he's so over the top and ridiculous looking that I ended up liking him more than the main cast for all the wrong reasons. Overall, the characters had a lot of potential but the poor storytelling let them down and turned even the most likeable characters into walking stereotypes.
While this show had a lot of flaws, I will once again say something nice about the show. It was a fun ride and I don't regret it one bit. Watching the show every week, seeing people complaining about the latest asspull, reading stupid Internet articles praising the show at the halfway point, seeing another article from the same guy about how bland the show was in retrospect, the Internet memes, the forum threads (Suguha's boobies), the Twilight comparisons, the new fans who praised the show, the new fans who jumped on the hate bandwagon, the Naruto comparisons and the glopping noises. Even though I never truly picked a side, it was very entertaining watching both sides fighting it out. Thank you anime community. You made this otherwise disappointing show fun for all of us.
Unrelated extreme subjectivity aside, the show wasn't a total disaster. But it wasn't very good either. It had it's moments but they were all balanced out by the flaws. I sat on the fence the entire time and stayed there no matter how tempting both sides were. There were things I liked about the show which made me want to be part of the fanbase, but there were things so bad that I wanted to hop on the hate bandwagon. Overall, the show is extremely mediocre. If this is the future of anime, I don't want to watch anime any more. It was a fun ride but not a very good show. You can count me in for Season 2 but I'm still sceptical about the show's future.",7
"
                Of all the anime I've watched this year, this one might perplex me the most. It's one of the more fundamentally flawed series I've watched this year, but at the same time, I found myself saying, ""wow, I'm actually enjoying this."" With that said, these are the things I did like about the series...
I can say for a certainty that I loved the concept behind it. I absolutely loved the concept of a game developer trapping gamers inside a virtual reality MMORPG and they have to struggle to survive in this world. In order to complete the game, they have to reach the top floor
                  and defeat the final boss to free everyone from this world. As soon as I heard that concept, I knew I would really enjoy this. Although, I will admit, this series tested my patience at times.
While it's been the topic of much debate amongst fans, I actually really liked the characters. The lead protagonist is Kazuto Kirigaya (Kirito), a 14-year-old (16 after the series jumps ahead two years) online gaming junkie who's a bit of a loner and I can say I liked his character. I wish the series would've done a little better job of hashing out his backstory, but considering that would become a minor plot point later on in the series, I bared with it. Asuna Yuuki was yet another character I really liked right off the bat. She's a bit cold toward everyone and for the most part keeps herself hidden, but you could tell she's a tough player. I really liked how they portrayed her as the series wore on during the Aincrad arc and (I'm not even sure I can consider this a spoiler anymore) thought it was nice that her relationship with Kirito went into a positive direction. My biggest complaint with Asuna is that I wish we could've seen a little more of her backstory both inside the game and out considering this series becomes very jumpy with its plot in the first 7 episodes. I liked the chemistry both her and Kirito shared, although that did change later on during the Alfheim arc. I also found the side characters to be quite endearing as well, although, many of them got very little character development due to a serious lack of screen time. I found Ryo (Klein) and Andrew (Agil) to be some very nice side characters that assisted Kirito and Asuna at times during the game, with Klein being the first person Kirito met in the game. The antagonists were done quite well and it was interesting to see how Akihiko's plot unraveled. The only thing I can say as a negative toward the antagonists was that they were rather predictable. It is one of those animes where you know EXACTLY who a villain is as soon as they appear in the series. Overall, the characters were good base characters, my one argument would be they needed to be hashed out a little better.
I did personally like the romantic elements behind this series, but I did find myself groaning at the forced romantic tension that was brought forth in the latter half of the series. I've seen many people consider this a harem anime, and while I wouldn't call it a harem myself, A-1 certainly gave an impression that they were trying to give Kirito one. While I didn't necessarily like this move by A-1, I thought they did a nice job ironing it out in the final four episodes.
I would mention the art and music being very good as well, but I don't there's any question that A-1 put an honest to God effort in with its budget. They even went out and got Yuki Kajira to do the music for this series, and she's one of the most infamous musical composers in the industry right now. It was nice to see LiSA come along with her for the ride after working together with Kajira on the Fate/Zero OP. They collaborated one more time with the 1st OP of this series and it ended up being one of my favorite anime OPs of the year. I found Crossing Field is an addictive song and I have to give A-1 credit, they made an OP that made me WANT to stay for the full ride. Overall, I will admit that this isn't Kajira's best work, but I will say that her average work is still better than a lot of composers' best. I found the music enjoyable, not her best work, but still enjoyable nonetheless and still fit the mood of the anime.
I said a lot of positive things about SAO, but unfortunately, this anime was far from perfect. The biggest flaw I found with the series was it felt too rushed. Considering this series was adapted from the light novel series by Reki Kawahara, I felt A-1 should've just focused on adapting the first two volumes instead of trying to squeeze the first four into this 25 episode set. With as many characters as they have in this series, I felt they could've done a better job of hashing them out if they only covered the Aincrad arc with the 25 episode set. Considering this anime is told from Kirito's POV, they could've done a better job of developing the chemistry he has with the supporting characters. I can say one thing for certain, if this series ended on the 25th episode like it ended in the 14th episode, I would be begging A-1 for a sequel and highly anticipating it. The 14th episode felt much more like a season finale than the 25 episode did, although, I can't really criticize the execution of the 25th ep. It was a ""nice"" conclusion to the series, but certainly not ""epic."" Then again, it seemed as though the 25th episode was half-conclusion, half-exposition. For spoiler reasons, I won't reveal why there's so much exposition in the final episode. I can say it wasn't unnecessary exposition, but it was a little tedious and does take away from the overall effect of the final episode. As I've already said, A-1 really should've split these up into two different 24-25 episode seasons. The concepts and content involved in the Sword Art Online plot is far too vast to fit two different arcs into a 25 episode series.
Yet another thing that bugged me and this should come as no surprise, I really didn't like how the ALO arc was handled. Of course, this point does go back a bit to my point of trying to fit two different arcs into a 25 episode season, but the ALO arc only had 11 episodes to work with...and even then, not all 11 of those episodes consisted of ALO material. On top of that, there was a STARK decline in the likability of the characters in the ALO arc. I didn't find any of the characters outside of the ones coming over from the SAO arc to be very likable or memorable outside of Sugou, who made for an excellent villain character. Even besides the point, I really couldn't understand what A-1 was doing with some of the ""imagery."" What I mean by ""imagery"" is that they really tuned up the ""ecchi"" and in this series, I really didn't like that. Most of it was completely unnecessary. Not only is it unnecessary ecchi, some of it is downright off-putting and while I'm trying to avoid spoilers, if you've never seen this anime before, there is a scene in episode 21 that will make you say ""WTF?"" It was a scene that caught me completely off-guard and it even made me hate the producers for putting such a scene in. While I'm not someone that necessarily hates ecchi, I just found it to be unnecessary for this series. While I cannot say for certain since I haven't read all of the light novel, I found the direction of ALO to be a bit odd. The SAO arc's focus was specifically with Kirito's character and built a lot around his interactions. ALO on the other hand seemed to go slightly more 3rd person, not only going off Kirito's POV, but Suguha's and Asuna's as well. It was a stark and noticeable change...and for the series' sake, I don't think it was the best move. I understood why they went that route with the ALO arc, but with this series setup in two halves, it's just very bizarre to switch a story's POV from 1st person to 3rd person right in the middle of the series. Again, yet another reason why these two arcs should've been completely different series runs.
The best way I can describe Sword Art Online? It's a good series. If we're going by MAL forum discussion, the series isn't as good or as bad as some make it out to be (not sure how many of you read the MAL forums, but I don't think I've ever seen such parity about the quality of a series before), but in my honest opinion, it's a pretty decent series. It was probably one of the better ones of 2012 that I watched, but then again, I have a very low opinion about the quality of anime in 2012. The writing isn't necessarily great and it does leave the impression that there was a lot more that they could've done with the series, but even despite that, it was a fun series to watch. While there were quite a few flaws that were quite off-putting at times, it was still a fun ride from start to finish and for the gamer in anyone, it's an anime I'd recommend, especially if you do enjoy a romance to go with it.",8
"
                I first watched Sword Art Online some while back because at the time I heard consistently good things about it in several reviews. This anime put forth the standard that the more hyped an anime is, the more skeptical I should be when watching it. Sword Art Online is the epitome of an anime starting off with a decent concept but not being able to live up to it in the end.
STORY: The story is a relatively simple plot to follow at first. Thousands of players are testing a new Virtual Reality MMO, and get trapped in the game. If they die in the game,
                  they die in real life. Instantly, threat is established and it seems as though the story is off to a good start. However, this is where things start to fall flat, in more ways than one. Pacing is inconsistent throughout the show, with several time skips of varying lengths, often times confusing the viewer and forcing them to readjust to the sudden changes. I will not spoil anything, but each episode feels like the viewer has to go back and make sure they didn't skip one with how often time skips occur. As for the plot, it starts to go downhill as soon as they take the focus away from the main story to focus more on episodic experiences, and it takes away some of the dire feel of the situation. As for season 2, to sum it up in a non-spoiler fashion, the viewer is treated to a sub-par villain with a situation that's far less dire than before, so the sense of danger that at least was felt in the first half of SAO is no longer prevalent, and it feels tacked on just for the sake of elongating the plot. 3/10
ART: One plus I can give to the show is that the art style is relatively nice to look at. The animation is high quality and the backgrounds are pleasant, and it looks as though enough effort was put in to at the very least make the anime visually appealing, but that's all there really is to say about it. I've certainly seen better, but it definitely doesn't look awful. 7/10 
SOUND: Similar to the art style, the music is relatively nice, but rather forgettable. There really isn't much to say about the music at all honestly, considering just how forgettable it is. It'd be one thing if any of it stood out in a good OR bad way, but it's rather bland in some places and rather decent in others, so there's really nothing that special about it. 4/10
CHARACTER (Minor spoilers, I'll do my best to keep it vague): In my opinion, this is where SAO takes its biggest hit. The cookie cutter plot was one thing, but the characters (or lack thereof) just have no redeeming qualities throughout the entirety of the show. Let me start off by saying there is practically no supporting cast. The story revolves around Kirito and Asuna (and another character to an extent, Yui). Minor characters are brought in briefly and then pushed aside, only brought back on occasion for fights or a quick cameo scene. I could perhaps forgive this if the main characters weren't so bland! I hate having to say this about a character in a show, but Kirito feels so bland. I'm not going so far as to say he's perfect, but he feels as though he has no flaws. He's smart, incredibly skilled, popular with many women (despite it being said that he's not good with talking to people, particularly women early on), and he never really changes or develops as a character. I won't spoil anything, but he's simply not written in a way that allows for the viewer to relate to him on any level. He's also inconsistent; one moment he'll be an emotional wreck, and the next scene he'll be back up on his feet with no problem right away. The same can be said for Asuna, the female lead. She starts off as an independent, strong willed character, then just a couple episodes in she completely does a 180 without any sort of indication as to why she would change as a character. I wish I could say the villains were at least written well, but the first antagonist of the show has non-existent motives, and the second antagonist is so cookie-cutter in that he's written specifically to be unlikable so that any sane viewer would hate him with ease. That does not make a well written villain. It feels lazy and uninspired, like the rest of the characters in this anime do.  1/10
ENJOYMENT: I really tried to give this anime a chance. Despite how south it seemed to go merely 10 episodes in, I chose to keep watching, hoping it would get better. Unfortunately, it did not. Even when death was a constant risk in the first half of the series, this show never gave me any reason to care if any of them died. The second half of the show brings in an awful subplot involving Kirito's cousin who is attracted to him, which just has no real reason to be a part of the show. It feels like it's there to be there, while the rest of the show just feels boring and like they just needed to get this finished. I didn't enjoy this, and found myself consistently questioning the directions in which it was going, and not in a good way. 2/10
OVERALL: Just about anything bad to be said about this show has been said before, so I'll leave it as simple as this. It was hyped so much, and disappointed me so much in the end because I was expecting a grand adventure, and it left me feeling like I'd just wasted my time. When it comes to seasonal anime like this, there are always going to be those who enjoy it and those who don't. If you want something pretty to look at and don't care about plot, and don't mind weakly written characters, then just maybe you'll enjoy this a little. However, if you're like me and you have a fondness for well written characters that you can relate to, and an engaging story that will keep you excited start to finish, I would definitely NOT recommend this anime to you at all.
Final Score: 3/10. Interesting idea, but poorly executed. I would not recommend watching it.",3
"
                It's been a long time i heard the popularity of this series and never had time to watch it nor i read its light novel or manga. And after watching it, i feel disatissfied and disappointed yet i understand why it is popular. 
This show were made for younger audiences who happened to grow with mmorpgs and being less critical folks. So if you are the type of person who appreciate quality in a story; well written plot, good settings, personality and development in characters or even just looking for an anime to leave you a memorable impression, don't bother to watch this. 
But if
                  you are the type of person who could care less about things and watching only for entertainment purpose; fanservices, mmorpgs trend, invincible mc, then SAO will work fine for you. 
I've read a lot of worst manga than SAO (mostly shoujo), but this is the worst anime i've ever watched.. So far. Simply because the story is a mess and somehow it got animated. When people often complain if a story gets draggy, too long, or getting nowhere. SAO has crazy pacing, ignoring details, and anticlimactic final boss fighting. Plus, the second half of the show (Alfheim Online) should be made a separate story/sequel rather than part of 'Sword Art Online' story. 
Thus, with many things to complain I did enjoy watching it to a certain extent though.",3
"
                After a friend recommended this series to me, (plus the fact that it was readily available on netflix) I went ahead and gave it a shot.
In truth, SOA breaks my heart. 
As plenty of people have said, the second season, if you want to call it that, is basically shit. 
It's so poor that I'm not exactly sure how to describe the entire thing, but let's give it a try.  
(Also, part of the reason that this may have spoilers is that the series itself is VERY predictable. Seriously. If the opening doesn't give it all way for you, I think you can tell
                  the plot from the very second, if not first, episode.)
The first 14 episodes were good. I'm not familiar with the MMO animes, I haven't seen .hack, but I enjoyed the premise. 
The setting is beautiful. It's why the Art gets a 9. Every panel is beautiful, the virtual word that the story takes place is so well fleshed out in beautiful colors and the art style is very good; The character designs are well done, and the animation is pretty decent as well. To go with the good art is the soundtrack, which is also top notch. The background music gets you riled up, even though the action scenes themselves aren't very intense, and the openings are catchy. 
That being said, you get to the problems. 
The story has its moments of brilliance. It IS too fast paced. Too many timeskips, too much filler-and given that the first arc is only 14 episodes, that time should have been spent better explaining the virtual world and how Kirito got half the power ups and met the people he did. Instead, the characters and their relations are rushed. What's funny to me is that the episodes that do the best are the ones that are meant to be stand alones, where there's only one character and their interaction with Kirito. I found the episodes with Silica and Lizbeth and their interactions with him (although every girl having a crush on him is extremely cliche and lousy) to be better developed than the romance with Asuna-which is especially weird because I actually like the main pair together. This is partly because the plot line focuses on them for the majority of the episode, while in later episodes, we're supposed to believe that they are in love and they're happy and they only want each other-but there's not really much proof of that. It's a lot of telling (though I guess showing as well, since it's TV) but not much feeling. 
Combined with the rushed battle sequences, and the complete lack of suspense and surprise, you watch this show FOR the character interactions, not for the action. Kirito is made to win pretty easily, and there's never a moment where I thought that it was going to be hard, or where I was at the edge of my seat cheering him on but worried something bad was going to happen. 
And since this show IS about the relationship of the main two-I will say this. It was refreshing to have a couple that got together without any unnecessary beating around the bush or denying, so that it could move on. We get to see the scenes of a relationship after they get together, not just in the process, proving that there's a lot more to tell after a relationship starts and that the story doesn't end there. 
Characters: Now I know this is a mixed bag. A lot of people HATE the main characters; call them gary stus and mary sues and who knows what else. 
And I agree with a lot of people on this show and their reviews-but not this part. 
Tbh, when Kirito and Asuna were introduced-I liked them both respectively. 
I found Kirito rather refreshing. Why? 
Because he still fulfilled the protagonist hero trope that's seen throughout shows and anime: strongest, saves the day etc. But I found him to be a lot more subtle than the usual Goku-esque MC. Not that there's anything wrong with that, because let's face it, e'eryone loves Goku. 
Yes, his flaws aren't too accentuated, and he doesn't have too many quirks, but I guess...he's...normal in that sense? More human? His personality isn't as much inconsistent as muted I would say. In real life people don't have too obvious glaring error traits, but multiple sides to their personality. I found Kirito to be likeable, subtle, and just a nice guy. 
Asuna was likewise, a strong female lead, and although different sides of her character could be called ""inconsistent"" I think these were more faults on the story telling and pacing more than the characters themselves. If more time came to developing them and telling the time that happened ""offscreen"" it would be more helpful. 
Of course, all of the redeeming things that SAO had to offer goes to shit with the second storyline. 
Kirito becomes to the point where he IS bordering on Gary Stu, and is almost unlikable at times. There's a completely unnecessary romance triangle that is kind of gross, does absolutely nothing for the plot, and just leaves you questioning who's idea it even was. 
Then there's the reduction of Asuna-who was second in command of the guild she was part of-to a damsel in distress, who on top of being in a cage crying and waiting for Kirito, is given no real role of action or to take charge of her situation, ON TOP of playing up gross tentacle molestation and sexual assault/attempted rape to further Kirito's man pain and provide as a plot device so that he can save her. 
It's gross, trashy and completely undermines her character. I can't comprehend how someone who created the women in the first 14 episodes, who yes, weren't without faults, could reduce them down to fetishized fanservice-which is what Asuna, and Sugu are. (And considering Sugu is a middle schooler, this is even worse.) 
Overall, I did enjoy the first part of the anime-there are many episodes I look at fondly, and that make me smile that have the potential to be rewatched. But after that point, it just gets stupider and stupider, and I'm almost embarrassed for the creators. 
No amount of pretty animation and good music can save the second half, which is why-as the warning I got from my friend in the very beginning-
Don't watch the second half, or you'll be left wanting to pretend it never exists.
Sidenote: I really loved the voice actors, even in the dub. So if shitty dub keeps you away, I have to say this one's is one of the better ones I've heard.",5
"
                Sword Art Online is a shounen action-romance that's got more in common with The Taming of the Shrew than it does with Romeo and Juliet.
The reason I bring Shakespeare's plays into this review at the very start is to firmly establish where SAO's biggest misstep lies. Romeo and Juliet is a play so influential that it's not only spawned a huge number of productions and adaptations (including one remarkably subversive anime series, which I wholeheartedly recommend), but it's also established the standard that the majority of romantic fiction ultimately aspires to: stories in which infatuated couples remain steadfast in the face of adversity (even if
                  that steadfastness isn't evident in the play itself). It did this while simultaneously challenging the patriarchal zeitgeist of the Elizabethan period, depicting both of the titular protagonists as fully-fleshed out characters instead of the gendered archetypes that had pervaded fiction for millennia even by that point in time. See, now we're getting to it. The Taming of the Shrew is, in contrast, one of Shakespeare's more thematically contentious works, so much so that even its myriad of cinematic adaptations have presented some way to subvert or challenge the subtext that the original play enshrines. In short, it was a frank endorsement of misogyny and domestic abuse in which a fickle and often times rebellious young woman was ""tamed"" by a man who near-literally beats her independent spirit into submission. Yeah, Shakespeare wrote that.
To reiterate, Sword Art Online does more to advocate the misogynistic qualities of The Taming of the Shrew than it does the idealistic romanticism of Romeo and Juliet. I'm sorry if that sounds more than a little hysterical, but that's how it is, and it's a subtextual issue so glaring that not even the show's few shining moments can serve as an effective disguise.
What really shields Sword Art Online's pre-modern sensibilities more than anything else is the seriously effective setup, which does a stunning job of painting a vivid and creative world that unfortunately ends up amounting to little more than a framework for bad character drama and near-nonsensical plot progression. And I'm not joking when I say that Sword Art Online's setup is SERIOUSLY effective! The context is well thought out and the design features on show are absolutely stunning right from the get-go. It has one of the best second episodes ever, and it follows that up by dealing out inventive and well-directed fight sequences and a few scenes of genuinely moving character drama. The characters all have appealing charisma, and lead female protagonist Asuna is established as being equal parts conscientious, wilful and conflicted. The foundations are there for one of the most compelling shounen anime that combines culturally-relevant context with strong action and dramatic romance, but unfortunately, Sword Art Online's way is to lay strong foundations and then build the rest of its structure up from loosely-packed mud.
Standing at the forefront of this storytelling debacle is the kind of pandering misogynistic characterisation that storytellers were making efforts to move past centuries ago. Our protagonist, Kirigaya Kazuto (know in-game as Kirito), is a mid-teens gamer who begins the titular death game with a slight advantage over anyone else because he took part in the game's beta test. The fact that he's a dedicated gamers makes the intention here clear: this is evidently the character that the audience is meant to relate to, even if those characteristics really only allow for a superficial connection, and his immediate distinction from those around him (which continues as he becomes increasingly overpowered) serves as a portent to the show's attempts to imitate the kind of male-centric power fantasies that have entertained the insecure and done little else for countless years. Attempts are made to make him genuinely sympathetic through the act of establishing an arc focusing on his guilt at the death of close friends and his isolation from other players due to his nature as a ""Beater,"" but it never feels more than an arbitrary attempt to give him a personality that extends beyond just being effortlessly cool. Very little of it carries any real emotional weight, and you certainly won't find yourselves reflecting on the show's interpersonal conflicts once they've been and gone.
Kirito's one thing, but the real horror here rests in the depiction of the fairer sex: the girls. There's a scene in episode 1 of season 2 in which Kirito discusses his plans to pursue a career in the development of VR technology, to which romantic interest Asuna responds simply with the banal statement ""I want to stay with you forever."" That basically sums it up. No female character has an existence that extends beyond being a romantic interest or secondary backup harem member to Kirito. This is made even worse by the fact that the show knowingly establishes motivations in nearly all of them. Asuna wants to lead the other players to victory. Yui wants to break free of the system and live a happy life with her adopted parents. Season 2's Sinon is given the most creative backstory yet (PTSD following a genuinely brutal personal trauma as a child), but even as I write this the show seems primed to shove those interesting internal conflicts aside in favour of reducing Sinon to another vapid love interest. All because that's just what SAO does. It takes any established personality trait in its female characters and hammers them flat until the characters themselves are fundamentally indistinguishable from one another.
They even have identical faces.
SAO's second big issue is that Kawahara simply has no idea how to tie the events of the story together. That's right, rule-bending contrivances are the name of the game! Any tension that manifests throughout feels inconsequential simply because, no matter what, the writer will find a way to make things work out. This is painfully obvious, and it really reaches some totally ridiculous levels. Need the MC to solo a high-level monster? Have him manifest a unique skill from nowhere. Need the audience (or at least the less intuitive of the audience) to think that the two leads are dead? Add ""Power of Will"" rules that allow for temporary resurrections. The worst example comes near the end of the Fairy Dance Arc, when a character comes back to life from nowhere simply so that the big showdown can reach some kind of resolution, however blatantly contrived it may be. That's not good writing! Sword Art Online keeps tying its few good ideas together with contrived and often superfluous rubbish that fails to have any kind of dramatic impact. Kawahara-sensei, you can do better than this! I've seen Accel World. Yeah, it wasn't a game-changer, but that was actually a pretty good shounen!
I don't think I need to keep going. Sword Art Online is bad. Not average, but straight-up bad. It enshrines the misogyny of The Taming of the Shrew while simultaneously putting on the face, Hannibal Lecter style, of Romeo and Juliet and a thousand other better action-romances. It's steeped in and derivative of the worst storytelling traditions, and despite being beautifully-framed and staged it does little to disguise the venomous subtext within. If you've not already seen it, continue to avoid it. If you have and you, like many others, genuinely feel that this series represents the epitome of fantasy fiction, I beg you to re-evaluate. We seriously can't let rubbish like this become the most commercially viable thing for producers to unleash upon a world where anime as a medium has the potential to do genuinely great things. Please, don't let it happen.",3
"
                This is my first review. Bare with me.
People will immediately shut me down for saying ""8?! YOU OVERRATED THIS ANIME.""
Sorry, I don't believe I did, and I will explain why.
Story: *semi-spoiler* Now we know episode 1 was great. It had a lot of potential. I was thinking ""How awesome would it be.. if we had virtual reality MMORPGs like this?"" Obviously without the trapping and you die you die situation.
So anyway. The idea there is great. Actually it's pretty fantastic, because it's something a lot of people would want in reality. So we have a great idea, whats next? Oh.. cool we now know there's
                  a tragedy at foot, and you cannot log out, you need to finish the game.
Here's the part where people are like ""Awesome! Let's see how this turns out!""
Then on episode 2 people get confused. Then episode 3 people get even more confused.. and eventually get annoyed and write reviews and get upset. ""WAAHHH THIS IS A FAILURE, SO MUCH POTENTIAL LOST *rages* WHY DOES THIS HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATING?"" Well I will tell you why. The LN has a 1.5 year time skip, and it's a bunch of arc's.. and we watch these arcs. (Episode 2-6) Are the arcs, it's a bad idea for a series to start with arcs.. but they wanted to do the show chronologically, which for the LN readers.. is a great idea.
Let me tell you, after episode 7 it should get better. *I hope* in the sense where.. what I have heard from my friends who have read the LN they say that the episodes 2-6 were arc's taken place chronologically, and the story becomes a lot better. So like I said, bare with the series, watch episode 7.. then 8.. then please edit your reviews to the new standards.
It's like this (Chronologically if you were reading the LN) Episode 1, Episode 7, episode 8, episode 2, episode 9, episode 3, episode 10, episode 4 (and so on) It's just that in the anime it becomes chronological, while in the manga it made sense. Eventually it all will make sense.
For the blunder of causing people to be confused and not explaining it properly: 7/10 for the story. Penalized -1 for it.
Art: The artwork is amazing, people got all ""The backgrounds are awful and they don't move in the show"" Well.. obviously. It's a splashwork, in a lot of MMORPG's you will have a boundry.. and beyond that boundry = just simple artwork. Since you cannot interact with it, it usually stays still, and just looks like a wall with a painting, until you come close to it obviously. So I'll give it a 9/10 because.. the artwork is good + puts a little bit of realism to it. (Although I am watching a low quality version of it because I am using a low GPU PC)
Sound: The soundtracks are unique, and are amazing. We all know it. Need I say more? 10/10
Character: You get further character development later on.. I am told, but as we can tell from the way the characters act, we actually get a few character development over time, so far so good. This may change in the future but as of now 8/10.
Enjoyment: 9/10 simply because the idea is great.. the artwork and audio is amazing. The characters are going to be developed sooner or later and they do it gradually. The story is decent, it does confuse people but personally I think it's better but for the sake of others I set that to 7, because really.. the anime shouldn't require you to read the manga.
Overall: 8/10.. because a 9 would be too high to give at the moment, and a 10 is only for masterpieces.
*This rating may change as the show progresses, since I do not know how it will end and how it will unfold, perhaps the anime will become a big disappointment because of budgeting.
** Please PM me about anything else. If you need more clarification why I gave the rating and such, don't flame/troll or you will be ignored.
*** This was my first review, please send me constructive criticism, even if it's about grammar/spelling. Thanks!",8
"
                I've never actually written a review before. I thought that I should go with a series that I don't like.
You already know the plot. The first episode seemed promising. The plot was interesting enough. The second episode however, skipped forward a month. (I can't remember how far it skipped ahead, let's just say a month.) We do not see the bland, generic main guy ""Kirito"" progress in skills, instead we see that he is already a ""supa cool awesome"" fighter that is better than everyone else playing the game. At this point, do we feel any connection to him whatsoever? Nope. We can't relate to
                  his struggles, simply because he doesn't seem to have any. 
In the second episode, the apparent main heroine Asuna appears. She and Kirito face off against the first boss and, surprise surprise, kill it with their ""awesum powers"". After that, we see Kirito go through a short change in personality, where he becomes more egotistical and brags about his ability. However, this change lasts all of 30 seconds, and he quickly reverts to his bland self, probably because any kind of personality whatsoever would make him less of a generic anime protagonist. 
Following this episode, we see some episodes that dont develop the plot any further. The basic premises of these episodes is ""Kirito meets girl, helps her, girl develops feelings 4 kirito"". That's basically it. One of the episodes, which I guess was supposed to make us sad, contains Kirito befriending a group of players, who ultimately, all die. This would of been a sad side story, if it had lasted for more than 1 episode. Had we of known these characters for more than 10 minutes, maybe we could of felt a connection to them. Once again, we fail to be able to relate to Kirito, seeing as none of us have made friends for like a day and then watch them all die. 
The rest of the first season basically consists of Kirito and Asuna forming a bland, generic relationship, despite having zero chemistry, and having hardly any screentime together. We have no idea what they see in eachother, or why they like eachother at all. They barely spend time together until they kiss for some reason. One episode after that, they have sex and decide to get married. 
The series ends rather abruptly in my opinion, with a terrible ending. Both of the two main characters die, but for some reason Kirito comes back to life with no explanation whatsoever and kills the final boss. We then see him awake in a hospital room, where he immediantly gets up from the bed and goes to find Asuna.
The series could of been semi-decent if they had ended there. But no, there's more.
The second season revolves around Kirito and his bland, uninteresting sister playing THE EXACT SAME GAME as sword art online, but with fairies. Apparently, Asuna has not woken up from playing sword art online, and tearfully, Kirito plays the dumbass fairy game to find his beloved waifu. He then meets the extremely busty and bland ""Leafa"", who teaches him how to fly. UNSURPRISINGLY, Kirito quickly masters the game. Leafa quickly develops romantic feelings towards Kirito, despite only knowing him for like 3 days.
Overall, Sword Art Online was an overall dreadful experience. 
Story: 3/10
I liked the premise, but it was not executed very well.
Art: 5/10
The art was ok, albeit quite bland and uninteresting
Sound: 6/10
Although decent, the music was not memorable in any way 
Character: 1/10
Enjoyment: 4/10
Although I disliked the series greatly, It was relatively entertaining
Overall: 2/10",2
"
                By now I think every anime fan has heard about SAO and seen thousands of reviews for it but I still want to write my own version. It was actually one of the main reasons why I continued to watch this show. 
To be honest, I have no idea where to begin...
Well for starters, do you like the main cover? Looks fascinating does't it? Some interesting character designs too! Do you want to learn more about the characters? Really? Well then... FORGET IT!
The things is, this shows doesn't have characters. Especially in the first and main arc. The only characters we ever see are Kirito
                  and Asuna, the main due. However, despite being main characters we still know nothing about them until like second arc =/
Are they interesting? Well they are not boring but I can't call them entertaining either. For one Asuna is your perfect wife and housewife. A type of woman any guy would like to have by his side. She is cheerful, beautiful and carrying. You will never get hungry for she is an amazing cook and your house will always be clean. She has every quality a dream woman should have and none that real woman does have. 
Same goes to Kirito. He is always friendly, kind, loving and strong. He never gets mad unless it is an enemy who threatens him and his friends. In a way he is same as Asuna. A dream man that any woman would like to have. He has all the positives of a dream man and no negatives of that real man. 
Though he is not a very good cook... so I guess he is less perfect than Asuna.
Story... oh boy, where do I even begin?
I'm sure everyone is familiar with the premises by now. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? I was beyond happy to start this series! Sadly the only good thing it had were premises, the real deal was horrendous! What could've become the best show ever, turned into a disaster full of lost potential! 
Before anyone says anything, I'm talking purely about anime not novel. Never read it. It might be the best piece ever written but anime defiantly isn't. 
One of it's major problems is a pacing. It is jumping between months like a bunny! I'm not saying that we should have 100 episodes to show every level, that would be boring. But to skip 50 levels in one episode? Isn't that a bit too much?
First episode starts quiet nicely, then we have a whole month time skip in episode 2. Ok, I can tolerate that. But what about episode 3? At the beginning of the episode, series had skipped through another 2-3 months! But do you know what is the best part? By the end of the same episode it is already whole year! They skipped whole year in less than one episode! Do you realize how much material it is?!
Just look at you own life! Just how much happens in just one year? How do people change? How do we change in one year?! Sometimes there can be drastic changes in a week! Yet here show simply skips through a very crucial time for players! They are stuck in this game where they could die any day because monsters are everywhere as well as dark characters. It's a panic time! Even if not panic, it is a massive change of life for characters where they go through a lot not just physically but also emotionally. However, show decided that it is not import and skips this whole thing straight to the point where characters already accepted their fate and live normally. It's like if author/creators had no idea how to explore human mind as well as develop them and decided to simply skip to the easiest part of the story.
That's actually not the only time they did it. It happens in almost every episode. It felt more like episodic show!
This pacing also effected character development. Let's take Kirito for example. In episode 1 and 2 he is the biggest coward  and then in a flash he is the bravest man on a planet. In episode 3 something major happens that turns Kirito into emo. However, in episode 4 he is all fine and happy. Why? Because another several months passed! Of course he would be fine! But does it really sit well with you? Once again it feels like if creators had no idea how to deal with Kirito's moodiness as well as how to solve it so they just skipped saying ""Time heals everything!"". They simply needed  something dramatic to happen to drive MC forward. They just created an excuse for him to change. They did not develop Kirito, they just conveniently changed him to benefit their other future idea. That's called lazy writing.
Another issue concerning characters... in one of the later episode Asuna tells her sob story about how she was crying all the time but then came Kirito her light! Do you know what is the problem here? SAO breaks one of the main rules of story telling ""Show, not tell."" SAO does everything other way around. It is very hard to feel sorry for Asuna when in every single episode she was shown as a happy, strong character. None of the issues she said were ever shown or hinted at. Creators simply felt like she needed a sob story. If she was a side character, ok fine. But she is a freaking main heroine! You don't just skip things like that!
Talking about characters... every side character appears maximum for like 25min, basically just for one episode. You are lucky to see them at least for another few seconds later on. Most of the characters are already good friends with Kirito and forgave him everything. None of the issues were ever addressed. 
Also it is a game, their real bodies are still out there and need treatment... where do they get it? How did they function for the last 2 years?! This question got answered only at the end of the arc when no one already cares. Bodies are taken to the hospital and looks like during that time characters had fallen asleep. One again we were told not shown. Show once again didn't bother to show us that abnormality. Don't you think it is important? Characters suddenly falling asleep? That's major! It could leave so much for speculation too! But no! 
In all honesty it feels more like normal fantasy setting where characters have lived their whole life not like a death game where random people/gamers got stuck.
Deaths are pretty flashy and sometimes it is hard to take them seriously. Maybe it is my own opinion but I believe that series would have been so much better if we actually got to see what is happening in real life. What happens to the bodies? How are families dealing with it? How is government dealing with it? Did they just leave 10 000 people be?!
Kirito is the biggest lady magnet too. To make it worse every single female out there is probably a lock in who spent her whole life watching romance movies. 
Females like that do exist, but every single one of them? Really?
This show has lost so much potential it is not even funny!
I have so much more to say but I'll stop and will address it's second arc now.
ARC 2
Unlike many others, I actually enjoyed this arc far more and for me it was a saving point for this series. 
Story wise it was bad and quiet un-original. However, what made this arc better is the fact that we finally have a linear story and you do't feel like you have skipped something. Another plus is the fact that we finally have more actual characters! They still need more depth but in comparison to SAO arc they already have 10 time more presence. We also get to see what is happening in real world. Not much but better than nothing. We see how real bodies look and learn about consequences. 
On it's own this arc was useless especially since main theme was a typical Dam in distress arc. Also players are taking game way too seriously. they make great speeches about sacrificing themselves, cry when someone dies and... what's the point? In few seconds the same characters comes back like nothing happened... it is not SAO arc! Scenes like this should be done there not here!
Also who said that SAO is very original? I lost count on how many unoriginal ideas it has:
a) Deus Ex Machina, Kirito just loves it! To be frank, he is the most over powered character there even thought it is a game where everyone can upgrade. 
b) Unrequited cousin love, it is almost in every anime now.
And so much more! But those are the most glaring ones. 
To be honest, if creators had combined two arcs, we could actually get a decent show. SAO would finally have a linear story with actual characters and development but like that it was just meh...
About good parts... well animation and character designs are beautiful. I would love to see one of those worlds so I have no complaints here. It also has some awesome soundtracks. 
Despite it's flaws SAO still had some nice and memorable moments that I liked but sadly there are too many minuses. I didn't even list half of them...
Sorry guys but I find this show average. It had some good ideas but with horrible execution. Also a lot of bad and over used ideas, some of the topics were never ever really dealt with like for example dark killer guilds.
I can tolerate 8 and 7 marks but I totally can't accept 9 and 10 especially when people themselves admit that show has flows and that novel did this or that better. 
Before you SAO fans will start to scream at me, shouting ""Fuck you, SAO still has high rating."" let me ask you one thing... do you know why?
Think about it... how many so called haters have given this show 1 or 2? I'm for most part hater but I tried to be reasonable and gave it 5. Imagine that all of us were to lower our marks to 1 and 2... How big will be this difference?
It will fall, I guarantee you that. So before calling us names think, it is thanks to us that this show is holding the high score, not only you.
Besides shows have to be criticized otherwise we would have thousands of works with perfect mark and then no one could call fanfics bad.
Now to those who still didn't watch the show... you heard my opinion, it is a waste. Will it be a waste for you? Don't know.
I addressed some of its main issues, if you believe you can handle them then sure watch it. If no, stay away.
The way I would summarize SAO, especially arc 1 would be a children show because of how simple it's structure and development is. 
That's all I have to say for now.
Thank you for your time, buy!",5

                From the moment I finished the first episode of Sword Art Online all promises of a good show flew out the window. Some problems became immediately clear to me and it first episode failed to capture my attention in any way. Yet, at the same time I stuck with it, hoping it would improve, and in some respect it kinda did. Not enough for me to call it or consider it a good show, but nothing I would consider bad in general either. For all it's problems it always kept me entertain whenever it did something good or bad. The ideas it had were interesting
                  even if not executed properly most of the time. It’s simply a well produced show that tells a story poorly, but in a very entertaining way. 
Synopsis:
In the year 2022, the virtual reality game Sword Art Online is released. Using a Nerve Gear, players can control their characters using their own minds, and experience the world of Aincrad as if it were real. Unfortunately, it becomes all too real when the creator of the game locks everyone out of the real world by hijacking all the Nerve Gear devices so that if you die in the game, you will die in real life. Only by clearing the 100th floor and defeating the final boss can the players win their freedom.
Good: Solid Production Values
A-1 Picture is a studio that I just acknowledge exist. This studio hasn’t made anything that I liked or hated wholeheartedly. However, when it comes to their production values they are consistently solid including the very colorful Sword Art Online. Character designs are simplistic and the locations are diverse. A-1 Pictures take advantage to show off snowy mountains, grassy fields, ancient dungeons, and many more to their advantage. Colors are simple and plain because lightning is rarely a factor to how a scene will look. Don’t expect much shading from this show, let alone gradient. In movement the animation is smooth from beginning to end without any noticeable issues. 
One of my two complaints about the animation is Sword Art Online misses depths of perspective. Everything in the show looks flat, making what little use of 3D there is stick out. Another complaint is the action scenes are very weak. The choreography for all of them are simple which would have been fine, but whenever a spell or a weapon makes an impact on a person there is little visual flair or particles effect to add to the action. It’s similar to lighting up a firework and waiting for the true spectacle to occur, but it never comes because it’s a dud. I should add that the first opening intro is very misleading in representing Asuna as an strong component character who is as skilled as Kirito. In the first opening intro it shows Asuna and Kirito beating “The Gleam Eyes” while in the actual show it doesn’t happen. It’s almost as if A-1 Pictures acknowledge in their own way “Yeah, this character sucks. Sorry”.
All the music in the anime is a good fit with the show. In particular the closing song “Overfly” by Luna Haruna perfectly fits the romance side of the series. Of course that could be due to the second outro being more visually creative giving bits of the character relationship in pictures where the first outro is just camera panning down two characters doing nothing. The opening themes aren’t impressive. “Crossing Field” sung by LiSA sounds phoned in (especially if compared to Oath and Sign) and Air Eoi “Innocence” is passable. Any piece of music that isn’t the opening or closing themes fits with the show. It’s never distracting, but at the same time hardly noticeable as it never fuels audience’s emotion to create a powerful scene. It simply works in the show.
Voice acting is good, though not a single performance stands out regardless if you see it in Japanese or English. Both versions have a different take on how the voice actors portray the characters. The English dub cast are (mostly) subtle in their delivery, but in Japanese there’s more emotion driven into the performances. If you have to choose, I would recommend seeing it in its original Japanese language if only because the animation doesn’t deliver spectacles worth your attention.
Mixed: Mixture of good ideas that fail to live up to potential 
Sword Art Online first arc (episode 1 - 14) suffers from rush pacing. It’s damaging to the point that on episode 13 it finally decides to address a major plot hole established in the pilot episode regarding how the players' bodies are kept in a stable condition in the real world. If it takes that long to address a gaping plot hole there’s less chances whatever the material tries to tackle will come out better. For example, Asuna is introduced as a player who is on or close to the same skill level as Kirito holding her own in a fight in episode two. That quickly changes when Asuna is pushed to the sideline and given little to do afterwards. Usually involving cooking, cleaning, and needing to be saved. Another drawback to the pacing is skipping around time. You frequently skip months in the story with the anime usually relying on generalizing events than actually showing. Like how did Asuna obtain a high ranking position in the “Knights of the Blood” made further questionable when seeing her contribution when working alongside Kirito. 
When out of focus episodes will go off track from the main story. These side stories flesh out the world by showing how the game mechanics work, but all at the cost of being filler. On the other hand, these side stories do keep the story unpredictable, even if the outcome never changes. Some other positive points about the first arc is there is risks of losing inside “Sword Art Online”. Not anything the main cast will suffer because Kirito’s overpowered, but it is established and touched upon in key scenes. While not as explored as the subject of death, it does bring up the mindset of different kind of players. Showing some diversity to offset the goody two shoes the story focuses on. Another positive is the romance doesn’t end with two characters becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. It shows two characters as a couple and runs with it for awhile. Although the downside being the couple aren’t interesting as stand alone characters let alone when they become a couple.
If there’s one thing that can’t be overlooked is how often it contradicts itself. It’s more than willing to break its own rules to make its protagonist come across as being awesome. For example, Kirito said himself it’s much better to be in a guild, but in Episode 8 single handily defeats one of the toughest bosses by himself. This also applies to gamers in the show who don’t know how to play the games. In Episode 2, it’s established to take place an entire month after the first episode and gamers still don’t know how to play the game. Either leading to speculation that most players of SAO are idiots or don’t bother to learn how play the game knowing their lives depending on it. 
Now due to the course of the anime I encourage you to avoid the next two paragraphs to avoid spoilers. I won’t go into specifics, but just the mere mention of it will spoil  “Sword Art Online” Aincrad Arc (Episode 1 - 14). 
----------------------------------------------Spoilers-------------------------------------------------
Episodes 15 - 25 make up the Fairy Dance Arc that takes place in Alfheim Online.  A noticeable improvement is the pacing is slower. Allowing more of the story to unfold in real time instead of generalizing important events in exposition. However, some issues in the Aincard Arc carry over to the Fairy Dance Arc. Asuna character receives another downgrade and becomes a plot device to move the story forward. Sadly, that’s all of Asuna contributions in the Fairy Dance Arc. It also does away with the consequence of death that the first arc got across. Stakes are smaller and the scope of what it tackles is smaller. Plus going from a setting that has dragons, ghosts, and Santa Claus gets replaced by a setting filled with Fairies. There’s no competition, which arc has the more interesting setting. It might sound like a downgrade, but it improves in one area with it counts.
Since the story becomes more personal there’s no filler in the arc. Everything done is to move the story forward. It still suffers from the same problem of giving supporting characters little to do, but it is not as noticeable since an entire episode won’t be dedicated to helping out a random character who won’t make another appearance. Then there’s Suguha whose characterization is better handled. From her introduction as an important character we see her progress from her conflict from beginning to end. Unfortunately, there’s never a love triangle that arises from her involvement. Just like every other female in the show, Suguha has to rely on Kirito to do everything in the end.
----------------------------------------------Spoilers-End---------------------------------------------
Mixed: Likeable, but bland characters
Kirigaya Kazuto or Kirito as he commonly referred by is a bland protagonist. Kirito is overpowered to the point that if there is an ever moment of conflict, he’ll make sure to eliminate it. Every battle and every dungeon Kitiro goes in, there is never any doubt about his survival. Even without the “He’s the protagonist, of course he won’t die” invisible tag attached to his character. Diminishing any worthwhile investment since he easily overcomes any obstacles including boss fights. The worst aspect about this trait is the audience doesn’t even get to see Kirito become stronger. If it was another genre of gaming, it would make sense...except Kirito play games specifically designed for multiple people to play together. Yet, somehow with his lone wolf attitude Kirito is able to get to a higher level than any other player that play in a group. Anyone who plays an MMO will tell you how difficult it can be to level up, especially if you’re a solo player. What’s most questionable about him is the way he thinks. For some reason he keeps how strong he is to himself, despite the fact if he played at his full abilities he can prevent more people from dying. His actions are equally harmful to the people trapped in SAO as a antagonist. 
Another (lack of) trait is Kirito suffers little eternal conflict that gets explored. At one point the show explains why Kirito is into gaming, but doesn’t expand on it. Instead of adding on Kirito accepting the game he’s trap in as real life. It’s left as an interesting, unexplored characteristic of his character. Everything always seems to work his way sometimes without his involvement in the solution. This kind of character or wish fulfillment can be done correctly. For example, in Persona 3 you take control of a seemingly perfect character (that you could name him/her whatever you want) with a status of the chosen one. Much like Kirito, Persona 3’s Protagonists builds his/her stats until he/she is perfect at everything. The difference with Kirito is his backstory is never a focus at any point in the series. Whereas Persona 3’s Protagonists backstory is given fleshing them out. No longer are the characters simply overpowered, but developed characters that blend with the cast. From beginning to end Kirito remains static with no major difference from where he begins to where he ends up.
Asuna serves as Kirito love interest. She could have been a good character, but beyond episode two the series does everything it can to lessen her importance. Instead of being an equally strong character like Kirito she eventually becomes reliant on Kirito like virtually every female character in the anime. What makes Asuna case different is how she was introduced as an equally skilled player which is not the direction the story took her in. This introduction makes her the most disappointing in the cast especially with what's done with her in the second half. Another significant female character is Yui whose an AI or little girl ex-machina. Her contributions are similar to Asuna in which she becomes a plot device to move the story forward in the second half, but early on is involved in a side story about family. To get it out of the way it was rather heartless, but at least it contribute to the main story and one of few times character development of Asuna and Kirito as a couple works.
The last significant female character is Kirigaya Suguha. Despite not appearing in the show as much as the series main love interest Suguha gets better character development. Suguha is a sympathetic character all due circumstances from her placement in the story. Her feelings in a situation are rely to the audience properly to understand where she’s coming from. Making her conflict in her feelings for Kirito that she never thought about much. She doesn’t know if her love for Kirito is right or wrong due to circumstances she’s not entirely sure played a part to influence how she feels. Like the other female characters she does end up falling for Kirito, but unlike the rest of female cast Suguha feelings has some depths. As a character she grows in the story for the better not taking steps backwards. 
Male supporting characters won’t be as reliant on Kirito since an entire episode is never dedicated to Kirito helping out another male character on a dangerous quest. The most he does for a follow male is teaching them how to play, despite the person spending tons on money to get the equipment to play the game and having waited three days in line to get it. If it’s a male other than Kirito they’ll spend most of their time off screen. This rule changes if the male happens to be an adult than chances increases they’ll be evil. Most of the adversaries Kirito fight against are mostly male, which in itself becomes tedious. Although, that last sentence should be filed under personal pet peeves instead of a flaw in the show.
Personal Enjoyment: Surprisingly, I was never bored
Well you did just read a couple of paragraphs of me favoring the second arc of “Sword Art Online” over the first. Just because I prefer one arc over the other doesn’t mean “Sword Art Online” quality will change. It’s story is never consistent in quality, but it is always entertaining. Whenever there is a bad scene in “Sword Art Online” I find it entertaining. From Kirito gaining the very stupid and non insulting nickname of “Beater”, any scene involving those useless teleportation crystals, and seeing Nicholas The Renegade (Santa Claus) being a few stand out. Thankfully not everything in the series was poorly thought out as there are actually good scenes in “Sword Art Online” I liked. The ending in Episode 14 titled “The End of the World” was satisfying even if the outcome of it was completely due to deus ex machina. Another being episodes 22 & 23 where the scenes between Leefa and Kirito that made me realize I actually cared what happens.  
(Likely) Possible Complaints:
Everything I listed
The main character is Kirito
Everything that isn’t on the technical side if you loathe the story and characters
How popular it is (this one’s superficial)
This review if you absolutely hate it or absolutely love it 
Rating: 6/10
Production Values (Sound, Animation, etc.): 3/3
Story: 1/3
Characters: 1/3
Personal Enjoyment (Yes, my enjoyment is worth the least amount points): 1/1
Final Thoughts:
When I got to the final episode of Sword Art Online and sat through the closing credits with still images my thoughts on the show were immediately clear. It’s not something I would call a good show with a story that has good ideas that get squandered by poor execution and characters that receive little character development or get pushed to the sideline after a single episode. However, it was consistently entertaining and always had my interest no matter how it turned out. There's is one thing that is for certain regardless where you stand on Sword Art Online quality. It'll leave one strong impression on the viewer before and after it ends.",6

                As good as this show is, I don't see why it's so popular and highly rated. It IS an okay show, but not a GREAT show. If you've ever read ""Heir Apparent"", you'll know what this show is like (though there are obvious differences).
Well, let's get on with the review. 
The story get's a 6/10 from me. It's filled with cliches and goes way too fast (Yes, I know of the time constraint they have and such, though the show doesn't pay the LN justice). It's an interesting concept with the idea of a Death MMO kind of thing, but I never liked how everyone
                  didn't ask many questions and hopped on the bandwagon, and how there isn't very much interference form the real world. 
The art and sound are both 8/10s for me. It's good, goes well with the mood and theme of the places, and overall looks and sounds great.
The characters get a 6/10. Main characters are supposed to be somewhat relatable and likable, and I can't see very many things in Kirito that I can like about him, and the other characters are easily forgettable and come in and out of the show. Nonetheless, there still is tons of time for character improvement, but first impressions are the MOST IMPORTANT things in an anime/game/show/book, etc, even more so important that some of the endings. If things about characters aren't captivating in the beginning, it's a skip for me.
The enjoyment is 7/10 for me and overall, a 6/10. It's a fair show, but meh, there are lots better.",6

                The protagonist is stuck in a virtual reality game. The players are unable to log out and death in the game also means death in the real world...
After reading the summary above, many people would think, ""Aah, this is just like .hack// ...""
I have seen many people thought like that and they just watch SAO because they liked .hack, or worse, they dropped it because they are disappointed with .hack. So I'm writing this review as an advice : If you are one of these people, I assure you, you have made the biggest mistake in your life!
Story : 10
Having read all SAO light novels
                  out there, I can say that story is SAO's strongest point. With a good adaptation, this anime won't lose to other anime with superior story like Clannad, for example.
Art : 10
Honestly, I prefer the LN's character design more, and a little disappointed with it. Fortunately, the world's art more than makes up for it.
Sound : 9
I'm still not too sure here, because I haven't heard most of the characters' voices. I loved the OP/ED though...
Character : 10
An ordinary high school boy, a delinquent, or a pervert. These three are the mainstream types of anime protagonist nowadays, and I'm sick of it. But that's not the case with SAO. A Splendid gamer who isn't daunted by fear of death and became one of the highest leveled player, Kirito is really one of the best protagonist out there.
Enjoyment : 10
I hope the pace continues like this. It will be a big loss if an anime with great potential got ruined just because the pacing that is too slow or too fast (*cough*Guilty Crown*cough*...).
Overall : 10
Now it just depends on the producers. Will they keep doing well like this and made SAO one of the anime masterpieces, or screw up and got cursed by all SAO fans out there (including me ;) )....",10

                This review is subject to alteration upon completion of the series. ""Sword Art Online"" is currently airing, and I usually do not bother reviewing a show until watching it in full, but I felt compelled to share my opinions at this stage. 
I'll admit to being wary of the show when I began watching. I typically find it hard to get into the mentality of shows focusing on virtual reality or other mediums of escapism, as they sound trite and deluded for the most part. ""Sword Art Online,"" however, interested me right off the bat. The synopsis sums up the story, but only on a
                  surface level. In the first four episodes alone, the main character adapted to the situation presented to him, experienced emotional trauma, and grew substantially in order to survive. 
This brings me to a hiccup in the experience: the pacing. ""Sword Art Online"" is based on a rather lengthy light novel series, so the producers had quite a bit of material on their hands. Since the story is centered around an MMO, the characters have to increase their level to survive. Now, ""Sword Art Online"" is a twenty-five episode series from what I have gleaned. Given the length of the series, a lot of content needs to be cut in order to fit the bill. 
This, as you might have guessed, creates an issue with the pacing. The format of the series skips all of the level ""grinding,"" focusing instead on larger plot points and side stories crucial for character development. In effect, this gives the series a bit of an episodic feel, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. In this case, the episodic approach eliminates a lot of the filler that would otherwise inhabit the episodes. That might attract a certain demographic (fans of Bleach, Gintama, and Naruto come to mind), but it also repels several others. 
Stepping back from demographics, I'd like to input my opinions about the story itself. At this point, the story looks promising. There looks to be considerable build-up for some antagonists to pop in, along with the possibility for outside interference and a sudden game-change executed by the game master. I cannot say much at this point, however, since the ending does seem rather predictable. Even so, the potential is outstanding. 
Aesthetically, ""Sword Art Online"" is top notch. The animation is fluid and the characters cleanly drawn. The background visuals are stunning at times, even when they adopt a medieval theme. The combat is also quite well done. The movements are fairly realistic, rarely deviating from the norm insofar as gravity and movement speed. Combat itself is handled nicely as well. At first, the characters' ignorance in combat shows in their awkward positioning and reliance on simple techniques. As they grow, however, the focus shifts to precise slashes and a conservation of energy, which is consistent with realistic fighting. 
The sound was not as tantalizing as the art, but the background tracks suited the moment, and there was rarely, if ever, a disjunct between the sound and the atmosphere being conveyed. The opening and ending songs are nice, but not extraordinary. They sounded fairly stereotypical.  
Overall, ""Sword Art Online"" appears to have potential. I am eager to see where this series goes, and whether or not it can continue on at its current level of excellence. As I mentioned earlier, this review is subject to alteration as the show progresses. I'll try to be prompt about it so that my review reflects my current opinions on the series.",8
"
                First of all, I want to say that if you’re an unconditional hater of Sword Art Online, don’t read further please. I noticed that there are an important number of low rating reviews for this anime, so I think having another point of view would be great. Anyway don’t get wrong, I’m not writing this review to make the praise of SAO, I just want to share my feelings. Constructive criticisms are always welcome.
Sword Art Online is surely the anime which divides the most this year. But I think one thing brings people together in agreement, this anime had an amazing potential. Only by seeing
                  the first two episodes you’ll see it. The plot is well introduced and really interesting. Having the consciousness trapped in a perfectly modeled virtual game, and with only one possibility to escape from that: finish the game, is quite captivating.
Then come the development of the story, when Sword Art Online definitively lost a part of the viewer. Why? To me, because some people didn’t expect what the producers wanted to describe in the show: the feelings. Love, fear of death, friendship, treason…. Yeah this show has a considerable part of describing feelings by scarificing some action scenes. And I don’t think everybody was disappointed by that. Anyway, if you’re going to watch this anime, have that in mind: you won’t watch a show full of action, fighting scenes and hard trainings.
Let’s talk about the action now, in one word: sloppy. Come on, fighting scenes against bosses, apart from episode 2, are like two minutes long, what’s that? We just begin to appreciate the fight and it finish hurriedly. The fight with the suspense the most appreciable exactly takes 1min15, and it has at least 20sec of thiking of the protagonist. This isn’t the strong part of the anime, you’ll understand it. As the fights, the story is a little rushed. Kirito sometimes up 10 levels between two episodes, it personally didn’t disappoint me, but I can understand that it can do, so it’s important to say it.
Fortunately, the romance catches up the anime in extremis, but not everyone agree with me I think, let’s develop for people that plan to watch it. Yeah it has 5 ‘loving’ story in the 25 episodes (even if for me 2 of them are more a male-girl friendship), but only one is reciprocal. And it isn’t a harem or something like. It seems to be a lot, but it really deserves the anime, and his purpose. Once again, it’s possible that you disagree with me, but I just share what I think. 
So if we’re talking about relationship, let’s have a look at the characters. The protagonist, named Kirito in the game, is firstly a reclusive person, who prefer stand and play alone. What is really great is that we will see how, in facing challenges and risking his life, he will grow up in mind. Firstly thinking that he is overpowered and super-skilled, he will become disillusioned, and will see that he is nothing but somebody fighting for his life, like everybody in the game. The meeting with Asuna will really change him. Asuna is another main character, a girl that wants to escape the faster possible this world. Why she is well made? Surely because she make the dream of any MMO players come true. A girl playing a massive multiplayer game, beautiful, and really skilled. 
I can’t really describe others characters since it will have more spoils than information. Moreover, some characters only appear in one episodes, but it once again deserve the anime, more precisely the setting here. We’re in a game, so it’s quite normal to meet somebody one day, and never see him again.
For the art & sound now, I’m not an expert, so I just will say that it was not that bad. It’s smooth, clear and detailed. The only thing I blame on the graphism is the character design, that could have been better, but it’s just my point of view. For the sounds, I really really enjoyed the fighting theme. It fits so well that it’s a shame to make all this work for only a 2 minutes fight. Openings and endings are really good, and even the lyrics are really well made for the anime, I mean it really represent what the show want to bring to the viewer.
In summary, Sword Art online is not as bad as a lot of reviewers say. It just follows its own path, surely different from what would be great to do for them. I’m aware that this show has a considerable number of lacks, but what you should ask to yourself is: Am I watching shows for all the work put in it, or just to spend a nice time? To me, the enjoyment is the more important thing to rate a show. Once again, don’t be outraged, it’s just my point of view.",8

                There are a lot of very negative and a lot of very positive reviews about SAO. I belong to the positive reviewers. It isn't great because it has a great plot or really deep characters, but just because it's very enjoyable and fun to watch.
story: 7/10
There's nothing special about the storyline, they just got stuck into a game and have to beat it. The only question you ask yourself is: why does the game creator do this.
In the second half ( wich is worse than the fist half), you ask yourself the question: Where is she?
You'll understand when you watch SAO.
Art: 10/10
If there's one thing
                  that makes SAO a good anime, it's the art. The game world looks so beautiful that you want to be there all te time you see it and the characters really look awesome. The art really makes this anime.
Sound 10/10
The opening of SAO is very nostalgic and you enjoy it every time you hear it.
Character 6/10
The thing that's really bad about SAO is the character developement and the characters' story. The only to characters that you know something about are Kirito and Asuna. Also ( spoiler ), Kirito suddenly becomes very strong without seeing that he trains or something like that. In a way it's kinda cool, you think: wow! Kirito's strong. But I think it would've been better if you could see him training.
Enjoyment: 9/10
When I watched SAO, it immediately got me interrested. The fight scene's were so beautifully animated and the game world was so beautiful.
Also it's just exciting and when an episode ended, you just had to see the next one.
Overall: 8,2/10
I enjoyed SAO a lot, it's definitely not the best anime I've seen but it sure was worth watching. I definitely recommend SAO, you'll not regret it. If the second half was as good as the first half and if the character development was better, I would've scored it over a 9.",8
"
                Hey~ Looks like everyone's writing a review for SAO, so why not jump on the bandwagon? There will be some spoilers in the review. Just skip over to the overview if you don't want to read all the other stuff.
This anime probably gets a 7:2:1 ratio on its enjoyability. What does that mean? Well, out of let's say 10 people,  7 are going to absolutely love this and will wait each week for it. 2 are going to start out all hyped up, but will be disappointed somewhere along the way - but they'll still watch it. And the remaining 1 will drop the
                  series somewhere along the lines.
One of the biggest problem this anime really has is that people are/were too hyped up about it. Many went into it feeling anxious and curious, as if they were expecting it to be something like they've never seen before - and came out disappointed. Majority, however, went in excited and went out even more excited. 
I, for one, really love Sword Art Online - not because of the anime, but because of the Light Novel. So I highly recommend the LN for those who left somewhat disappointed with the anime to the Light Novel since you can ""connect"" to the characters a bit more.  Among the complaints, one of them is the time skip. Ep 1 ~ 7 is just a cluster fu*k of time skip. Of course, you don't have to worry about that in the LN as the LN is 'In Medias Res'. The anime producers obviously wanted to do 2 things with the time skips. One, make the anime longer and two, make the viewer able to empathize with the main character, Kirito, a bit more. This didn't work out quite well as many people wanted to see more of the stories in between floors and not just floor skips throughout the entire anime. But what can you do? The stories had to fit somewhere and it could only be the beginning.
Let's break it down with Pros & Cons now, starting with Pros, then Cons, then analyze:
PROS:
-Very nice graphics even in the 2012 standards.
-A very good example of ""action romance"" anime.
-Badass main character / heroine 
-Wincest...?
-Harem... -ish
-Adventure-ish 
-Original
-Nice sounds (OP/Ending/Soundtracks/Voice Actors and Actresses)
-Much better overall when compared to some other available anime choices you probably have
CONS:
-Time skips can make you feel left out / disappointed
-Badass main character / heroine
-Too much romance (depending on your taste)
-Things feel rushed
-Makes you question what the characters' existence is for (like Silica's)
Alright, let's begin analyzing.
_______________________
There's almost nothing to complain about the art. It's nice to look at - the characters are very well done (although the faces look distorted sometimes) and the overall ""world"" is in very high graphics.
Almost nothing to complain about the sound either. The OP is nice for both seasons and so is the ending. The voice actors and actresses did a fantastic job. Even the scenes with crying involved is very well done. I hate it when the crying voices seem so... unnatural.
Off to characters.
The main character is very... over powered. You either really like it or don't, but of course the main problems, arguably, is that no scenes of him actually getting stronger is shown - which also is either to your liking or isn't. The heroine is also very overpowered - but mainly serves to make the MC, Kirito, look more badass, since he'll have a cute girlfriend by his side. The 2 main characters will be either a hit or a miss for you, with of course, 7 being a definite hit, 2 maybes, and 1 NO. I don't really like this labeling of characters as ""main"" or ""support"" since their role definitely changes throughout the SAO series. Suguha for example is definitely a MC in the ALO arc, but reverts back to support in the other arcs. Kirito is the MC in almost all arcs except Mother's Rosario and Asuna is a support in GGO arc.
If you watch the anime, you'll probably think ""whatever happened to that one girl Silica? She was literally there for just 1 episode even though her character design made it seem like she'll stick around"". Well, she's a character used in later arcs and she literally has no appearance whatsoever in SAO and ALO so there you go.
You technically need 3 girls to make a harem, but technically 4 (as of now) likes him even though only 2 are leading roles in the anime. So harem is there... and of course, wincest.
Let's head on to Story.
The story is a very debatable topic. The story was written way back in 2001 or something when the author, Kawahara Rek,i didn't even think about publishing it so he just put things to his tastes. You either like it or you don't, but it's definitely more on the romance side of the whole ""action romance"" theme than it is to action - so the synopsis probably tricked you.
___________________________________________________________
Overview:
You'll probably enjoy this anime if you don't go into it thinking it'll be a masterpiece like you've never seen before. 
If you ARE hyped up about it or have read the LN, you'll probably leave being disappointed.
You should really watch this mainly for the romance between the two MC, especially since it has nice sound and graphics. Action is really just there to provide story so things develop more shounen style. 
If you really want to get more into the actions or the characters, you should probably read the Light Novel (watch the first 7 ep though since the LN starts at ep7). You'll be able to empathize with the characters better and you'll find the LN MUCH more satisfying than what the anime presents. Really, the anime should be more of an Eye-Candy. The Light Novel will be your steroids.
Thanks you for reading!!",7

                The amount of butt-hurt over this show is, in word, hilarious. The show is not the great piece of work to ever grace the world, but it really isn't bad either. 
At first I had thought they would clear all 100 levels of the tower and I thought, ""O god no not one of this dumb quest with a stupid repetitive fight anime's again,"" well I was happily mistaken. The story bounces around a lot, which for me is fine but for others is a huge hang up. The story does sort of even out a bit in the later episodes which I do prefer
                  to be honest.
Of course another complaint is that the characters are sue's or some shit, look, not all main characters need to be dark and brooding and have super secret pasts. Sometimes it’s nice to see a nice good guy get ahead, and in this anime that happens. Does he sort of glitch the game? Sure, but even the beloved dragon ball Z had the super long charge up world ending attacks. I happen to like it. I also enjoyed the romance. Of course people who hate the characters would disagree, but I thought it was well played out, and I am also a sap so that helped.
I would say give this show a try. I feel that a lot of the hate comes from people who just love to hate things that lots of people enjoy, to be blunt, the wonderful world of hipsters. I’m not saying everyone who dislikes that show doesn’t  have good reasons, but many of the folks I’ve talked too seem to dislike the fact that an anime that doesn’t totally redefine the genera could be so popular.  If this show floors your boat, great! If not fine, but the amount of time people put into hating this show is funny, it’s an anime, no one is forcing you to watch it, and your not changing minds by being a dick on the internet.
Final word: Well before I got a little butt hurt there I said something important. Give this show a try. You might like it, you might not, but I think it is good enough to be given a chance.",8
"
                Sword Art Online has got to be the most over hated anime of recent decade!! I realize it isn't a perfect anime, but I'm starting to believe that most of the hatred resulted from bandwagoning judging by some of the criticisms I've seen towards it. Does it have some flaws? Yes, no anime is without flaws, but I honestly feel quite a lot of people are overreacting as a result of expectations that were unfairly high, and they accuse it of FAR more than it actually has; even going so far as to fabricate reasons and outright lie about events that happened in each arc
                  just for the purpose of hating on it.
I know it's hard to trust anyone on the internet in regards to biases, but I truly did go into this series completely unbiased, completely unaware of the controversy it spawned. I will not try comparing the anime to the light novels, but, as someone that's had experience both reading and watching it, I seriously don't understand why so many people have been acting like the quality between mediums is like the difference between night and day, with the anime deserving ""trainwreck"", or ""the physical incarnation of Satan"" just because some details from the light novels weren't conveyed as well, and the adaptation has a couple of flaws. I will admit the light novels are FAR better in quality for most areas, especially in terms of inner-monologues, world-building, and more in-depth characterization, but that isn't to say that I think the anime was unbearably awful in every sense of the word, like most viewers would say.
I've heard people say, ""It's nothing but poorly executed wish-fulfillment"". I've come to realize this statement isn't exactly fair considering that all anime have some aspects that appeal to the viewer's unconscious desires. I realize the reception of this anime is very polarized, so I will now give my opinion on the widely popular anime of 2012. Keep in mind, I have watched the full series 3 times, with the first time during the time it was first airing on Toonami(so around the time everyone and their mom loved it and this whole malice filled hatred was almost non-existent).
I will only have one rule for this review: This is based mainly off the anime, I won't compare it to the light novels much since the light novels are more detailed. Keep in mind this is just an opinion with some examples from the actual show. Possible spoilers are ahead.
For Aincrad-
Characters: I'm honestly confused as to how people reached the conclusion that the character development was ""horrific"", or ""non-existent"". The main characters were fully developed since we got detailed explanations on their backgrounds, or at the very least enough information to know what background they're from. We got to see how they've grown after the time skips, and it just gets better in GGO.
Take into account character development consists of multiple parts such as area setting, how they react to others, their personality, being able to relate to them, and, of course, how they've grown over the course of the series. 
The side characters, while being sidelined for the most part, had great personalities. Nearly all the characters presented were memorable. Almost all of the side characters have some background to them, and can be pretty diverse. The only problem here really is the lack of screen time, making most of the side characters relatively flat.
The complaints that Kazuto Kirigaya was the very definition of a Gary Stu I found were complete fabrications, and quite possibly the biggest criticism filled with the most lies. Most of these conclusions I've had the displeasure of seeing have been based solely off of how powerful he is, and using a perverted definition of what the trope truly means, as the true definition means a character that has absolutely 0 human flaws, is basically a walking Deus ex Machina, never makes any mistakes, and never suffers any consequences; essentially being a god in that universe while still in human form. Seeing as how he does suffer consequences for his actions and clearly makes mistakes, such as being an outcast by being labeled as a Beater in episode 2, being part of the reason that the Moonlit Black Cats are dead, and even nearly being killed in cold-blood by the enemies he's made on multiple occasions, I believe these are some of the biggest reasons that he doesn't fall into this arguably awful trope. He further remains out of falling into this trope due to his constant human flaws shown throughout the series, such as being sensitive enough to the point of suffering survivor's guilt from being the only surviving member of the Moonlit Black Cats shown throughout Aincrad and mentioned in Fairy Dance, how lowly he thinks of himself in season 2 after forgetting those he's killed, how anti-social he is, having absurdly low self-confidence at some moments, deteriorating overconfidence during battles that he decides to engage in on a whim, losing all rational thinking when he snaps, and having the capacity to nearly murder someone in cold-blood, as showcased by the final conflict in the last episode of season 1.
The other would be his actual internal flaws and weaknesses. Judging from what I've heard too many people say, many people tend to overlook these parts seeing as how it's something that requires absolute attention to see; it's mostly ""show, don't tell"" aka Screen-Writing 101. Many of his personality flaws were given throughout the series to offset his essentially Glass Cannon stats. Some include snapping during battle, abandoning all rational thinking when he snaps(acting on instinct), being rude at first meetings, others in SAO hate him due to his Beater status, his emotions are used against him, and he is hard to talk to. Plus, he gets into some bad situations with others, such as with Suguha and Kuradeel. Klein even points out some of his flaws in Episode 9.
To put it simply, just because Kazuto is a nice guy and powerful in-game, even being strong enough to be one of the top players of the game, through training does NOT make him ""utterly flawless"" and ""walking wish-fulfillment"".
I just wish Asuna's background was touched on more in the anime during the Aincrad arc because the light novel had more details on her. I guess I'll have to wait for Mother's Rosario to be animated for her in-depth character development.
 9/10
Story: The story is set within the first Nerve Gear VRMMORPG: Sword Art Online. It begins with beta tester: Kirito logging into the official release of SAO for the first time, and helping out a newbie who asked him for help shortly after logging in: Klein. After teaching him the ropes, both are conversing about the game until Klein notices a key feature is gone: the log-out button. Shortly after this, the creator informs all of the players of the dark secret of Aincrad: there is no way to log out, and death in-game means death IRL. The series begins on this dark note.
Despite what the first episode says, the ""death game"" MMO focus is only about 1% of the anime, as it dives more into relationships and the psychological impacts, rather than the actual game itself. My advice here is to not have any specific expectations on this anime and NEVER take the synopsis at face value, as people will be disappointed that this doesn't focus on the game nearly as much as, say, Log Horizon. It pulls many twists throughout it, and ends up diving into what could happen if the line between virtual reality and reality began to blur, all while focusing on making the main characters as human as possible, and developing their relationships throughout, with the most focused one being between Kirito and Asuna.
True to what most people say, every MMO in the series, for the most part, does NOT follow traditional MMO gameplay. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have some MMO aspects(like outside battle skills, such as blacksmithing and fishing, or raid tactics like tanking), and some of the things MMO players enjoy doing in the MMOs they play besides fighting(I know from personal experience by playing a few that it's just as fun to explore and have a ""fantasy life"" than just fight). Also, there are plenty of MMOs that don't follow the traditional gameplay formula of ""cooldown periods"" and ""fixed-interval attacks""(Graal and MapleStory for instance), and focusing on this non-traditional battle system isn't an ""inherent and fatal flaw"". I won't make a comparison to the light novel here, but I'd suggest reading Vol. 1 if you want a grasp on how the SAO fighting system works, as that was more ""shown rather than told"" in the anime.
The story has plenty of exposition on rules and the more confusing plot elements through the dialogue, something that you'd typically find in most complex anime. This is usually is used for general world-building, setting up the stories, and presenting relevant information, making the series limited in significantly large plot holes. While this sounds like it would hinder the anime, it actually does it in such a natural way that it seems like normal conversations that people would have while playing a game with each other.
Perhaps its strongest point in terms of story is its ability to foreshadow most instances in the future, such as possibly hidden skills, or the identity of certain characters. In fact, a concept from one of the later arcs is foreshadowed from as early as the 1st arc. I won't spoil it, but I can guarantee it will clear up any misconceptions that the 1st arc presents if adapted properly.
The story was excellent and had the perfect mix of sweet scenes, emotionally heavy scenes, and action scenes. I never expected it to turn into a romance with a slice-of-life feel for the final episodes of Aincrad, but, holy crap, it was beautiful. The chemistry between Asuna and Kirito was great. It was an excellent romance. 10/10
Music & Animation: I'd probably consider this soundtrack to be Yuki Kajiura's best work, with stand-out tracks being Luminous Sword and Swordland, and it's become almost a given for A-1 Pictures to nail the animation. 10/10
For ALfheim-
Characters: Suguha was a great addition. She was a kind and caring character, and was downright awesome when she fought in ALfheim Online.
I quite enjoyed seeing Suguha and Kazuto's relationship as cousins reform, though it could have definitely been handled better from having a more normal situation. I thought it did a good job in portraying how complicated it was for her, considering the unwanted crush she had and the brother-sister relationship she and Kazuto had as kids. Anyone that calls this ""incest"" should look up the actual definition, as the actual definition is getting married or being in a sexual relationship with a closely related family member. Since there was absolutely none of this in Fairy Dance, as it was all about Suguha moving on from those feelings without doing anything even slightly immoral, I think others should take a closer look after their eyes are cleared from the fog of unconditional hate because of what I'd consider an unjust/unfounded controversy.
As for Sugou's age, I'll assume he's around Asuna's age due to his, ""She's hated me ever since WE were kids"", sentence in Episode 15's English Dub. Considering this sentence, I'm guessing the claims of ""pedophilia"" in ALO were fabricated as well.
Other than Suguha, ALfheim had some pretty good side characters with OK in-game backgrounds. Damsaled Asuna makes sense because of Sugou, but I still didn't like it. Sugou is one of the only villains in anime I truly despise because of how heartless he was for the entire arc. I still liked how Asuna was strong in will despite her position in ALO. She's powerless against Sugou due to his Admin status, so I can understand why she didn't do much.
I just have one question: Why didn't SAO's memorable side characters come back to help Kirito save Asuna?!
9/10
Story: Great drama for Suguha's love problems, more action, and a more contained story. My only gripes are Damseled Asuna and the ""Hero saves the Princess"" plot is kind of cliché. It's the 2nd weakest arc in my opinion, but by no means ""god awful"". 7/10
Music & Animation: Same as above. False King is probably the most stand-out new track that they brought to this new arc. 10/10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonus Points: Answering nearly every question to make it understandable, and giving sufficient information to draw conclusions to those that weren't answered.
Though it may have looked like a Deus ex Machina for Aincrad's ending, it was mostly just a slightly botched portrayal in the anime, as Kirito's ""death"" was a sequence going through his mind as a parallel to the ""death"" from a boar attacking him from the first episode, and not a ""Jesus' resurrection"" moment. He was just using his last moments alive to finish Heathcliff off, so calling it a ""Deus ex Machina"" is stretching it immensely. On top of this, Reki Kawahara has made such a thing as the Incarnate System in his other series: Accel World. Considering Kayaba's line in Episode 24 on ""human will being superior to the system"" and the Incarnate System being ""human will overcoming system boundaries"", I'm assuming this is what was used to allow Kirito and Asuna to perform those seemingly impossible feats. I hear their survival is explained in Project Alicization, and I await the explanation of this in Season 3.
Limited in actual Plot Holes. I feel people are using this term like it's hot cake without paying attention to the answers. Plot Holes would be inconsistencies that create paradoxes, or missing, yet relevant, information. The only one I see is never mentioning explicitly that the NerveGear can last 2 hours unplugged before frying the brain, but even that was implied by Kirito and Asuna's conversation in the KoB hall.
Kirito and Asuna's reunion in the real world bringing me to tears of joy every time I see it.
Norse Words Spell Casting was a very unique game mechanic for ALfheim Online.
While awkward in terms of how many there are, the time skips kept things short and sweet, and were executed well.
Not relying too much on ecchi fan service. In total it's around 4 minutes and 3 seconds for the entirety(and this is being picky on it). It's MUCH less compared to other anime.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Score: 9.5/10 Epic and worth watching.﻿ Depending on SAO II's presentation it may get up to a 10.",10
"
                This anime can be described by  one word: self-insertion. 
That's right. If you are looking for a wish-fulfillment character that you can ogle and admire, you've come to the right place. This anime has everything for that, good art, sound. Those with an escapist deriving pleasure will like this.
Now, for those viewers who want to find meaning in their mediums, who want to identify with characters, sorry you will be disappointed. With this anime being a 25-episode only adaptation of an extensive light novel, its quite apparent that there will be lots of cherry-picking in scenes, and that the anime developers were mostly interested
                  in revenue than quality. So a 9 rating for enjoyment is really just for those who came to experience short-term pleasure, but sadly others will have a 1 for satisfaction. 
So all in all, what you have as a whole is a mediocre package delivered. Our crude taste buds are engaged, but your aesthetic higher level buds will suffer.
So how is all of this represented?
Well, firstly, good art and sound are self-explanatory.
For self-insertion, we confront a main male character who is an idealization for any male viewer. Again, this ties in to the escapist's affinity for such anime. It's arguably not a bad thing to be: we all want to escape from our mundane lives into the shoes of an awesome character. But in terms of deriving meaning and significance, you're not going to get much and the anime will leave  you with a bitter unsatisfactory aftertaste. 
So how is the story bad? Well, again the creators are appealing to the self-insertion character: for some full episodes you will find the narrator become popular with cute chicks, and then future episodes they have no significance. In other words, you got creators who dispose characters. Characters whose only significance is to show how awesome the main character is. And again, it's not a dumb thing on the creators part. They know that kind of thing is appealing to many viewers, and thus will earn revenue. I don't blame them, that's just how people make  a living. But for mature audiences, I wouldn't waste time watching this, instead I suggest reading the light novel which I hear has more literary value, and does not exist for the sake of appealing to the viewers crude tastes.",5
"
                How exactly does one go about reviewing what is likely the most hyped as well as the most hated show this season?
It's not easy, that's for sure.
Some of you may remember my previous review of Sword Art Online, when it first came out. For those of you who don't, let's just say it was anything but...positive. I wrote what was meant to be a troll review, intended to make fun of the folks who hyped up this series when the first episode aired. It was snarky and heartless, but it was directed more towards those reviewers than the show itself. To be honest, I wasn't
                  sure what to expect from this show either. I know a part of me wanted this to be really, really bad. But strangely, whatever expectations I had for SAO in the beginning have completely disappeared by the end.
Before I begin, I have to point out that Sword Art Online is extremely flawed in numerous ways. That I can't deny. However, sometimes it's not simply the technical things that make a show worth watching. If I were to review this show with complete objectivity, it probably wouldn't get much higher than a 6. But I find that I just can't do that. Why? Because this show, somehow, has found its way into my heart.
Story: 6
The story is mediocre at best, and absolutely absurd at worst. Although the premise of a fully immersed virtual reality is appealing, it isn't very original, nor is it always executed well. I found myself questioning the mechanics of the two virtual worlds several times, and finding no comprehensible answer. The plot is often riddled with holes, and even if you were to ask me now, I couldn't tell you exactly what the point of many of the events was. Quite honestly, the first quarter or so was dreadfully boring. The side stories weren't very engaging, and there was no real sense of danger for much of the first arc. However, I began to fall in love with not the plot itself, but the world it created. I was never interested in MMOs until I watched Sword Art Online, and it was the whole idea of living in a virtual world where anything is possible that really got to me. I could never see myself at the frontlines clearing floors and battling monsters like Kirito and Asuna, but I could see myself as the old fisherman, peacefully living out his life as if taking an extended vacation. It wasn't the story itself that got to me, but the romanticized notion of an endless virtual reality. I suppose that's escapism, but then again, isn't that the core of this series?
Art: 7
The art in this series was based off the SAO light novels, so there isn't much I could say here. I rather liked the character designs, and I always thought Kirito had a suave look to him with the head-to-toe black. Pretentious? Extremely so. Cool? Definitely. The fight scenes were not as well-animated as I would have liked, but again, this didn't really detract from the story. The best scenes, in my opinion, were of the opulent, beautiful buildings and cities in both of the arcs. The lake house during the Aincrad arc and the neutral areas in the Alfheim arc were breath-taking, and I once again felt a longing to live there myself. All in all, the art and animation was decent. They weren't phenomenal, but they were well done and nice to watch.
Sound: 8
What more can I say? This is Yuki Kajiura, the Goddess of Anime OSTs. Sure, this wasn't her best work. I much preferred the music in Madoka Magica, or even MaiHime. However, the beautiful, haunting choral melodies and the rich orchestral pieces were still good enough to garner a solid 8 from me. In terms of voice acting, everyone seemed well-suited for their roles. I never read the light novels before watching this, so I didn't have any preconceived notions of what the voices should sound like. But I never found a single voice to be grating or ""off"", so I suppose everything is good in that department as well. Overall, the sound was great.
Character: 6
Unfortunately, this, along with the story was where we run into some trouble. The protagonist of SAO, Kirito, is your textbook Gary Stu. He's decent-looking but not gorgeous, with his own personal harem of pretty girls. He's compassionate towards his companions, and loves his girlfriend unconditionally. He's incredibly powerful, somehow able to pull off ridiculous feats at the swing of his sword. His amazing ability to defeat just about anyone and anything is never fully explained, other than the fact that he spent all his time playing online games and he used to train in kendo. Basically, he's a self-insert character with godlike abilities, and from the moment the show starts, you know there isn't a single character who would be able to overpower him. However, I found it very hard not to like him after awhile. Is it not reassuring to know that the main character, the guy you're rooting for in the story, will always prevail? To me, that lifts a huge weight off my chest while watching the show, allowing me to not have to worry about whether or not it will have a happy ending. And I like happy endings, dammit. So regardless of how contrived Kirito's invulnerability was,  I couldn't help but be sold by his ""strength"" and ""power"". I suppose Asuna needs some justification too, right? Well, to be honest, Asuna was too many different things all at once. She was tsundere, strong on her own, and perfectly capable of defeating her enemies, but she was also a hopeless romantic and later on, a classic damsel in distress for Kirito to rescue. Undoubtedly, Asuna was the ""perfect girl"" as deemed by the author of this series, and this left her in a bit of an identity crisis after awhile. But despite all this, her love for Kirito was real; more real than any affections the other female characters had for him. You could argue that Suguha loved Kirito very deeply as well, but her love for him never made sense. He was in a coma for two years, and no matter how you looked at it, he was related to her. And for a love to be truly real, it has to reciprocated as well. The romance between Kirito and Asuna is something that will always have a place in my heart. It was cheesy and irrational at times, but it was beautiful and uplifting all the same. In the end, it's simply two people in love, and that's one of the most heartwarming scenes you can imagine, regardless of the time, place, or situation.
Enjoyment: 10
I feel like I'm taking a huge leap here by giving this series a 10 in this particular category, but I believe I must. When I let my brain process this series, it's obvious that SAO has countless problems. There are so many things wrong with how this show was executed that I couldn't even begin to describe them, and even as I enjoyed it, I took note of these things. However, when I watched this, it wasn't my brain that responded, but my heart instead. I felt genuine empathy for the characters, and I was fully engrossed in their exploits. I was somehow able to ignore all of the glaring flaws and instead concentrate on the message of the series, which is surprisingly hopeful. It no longer mattered to me how haphazardly the story was developed, or how awkward the pace was, or even how absurdly overpowered the main character was. I absolutely loved every moment of this show, even as I think back to the first few episodes where nothing really happened. Sometimes, it's the essence of a show that gets to you, not the individual little things, and that's exactly what happened to me here. I give this show a 10 for enjoyment, not because it was intellectually stimulating or incredibly innovative in anyway, but because I loved watching it and I won't be able to stop thinking about it for a long time.
Overall: 7
I can't possibly rate this a full 10, of course. Every series has its faults and its merits, and despite the fact that I could overlook the flaws in my own enjoyment, I can't just pretend they don't exist. But if there's anything to be learned from a show like this, it's that sometimes emotional investment is worth a whole lot more than a perfect story with deep characters. Sometimes, in order to find a show enjoyable, you just have to go out and enjoy it. Thus, Sword Art Online gets an 7 for being the best badly-executed self-insert fanboy-pandering show I have ever had the pleasure of watching.",7
"
                WARNING: MILD SPOILERS
Before you guys click the ""not helpful"" button, let me clarify my position before you shower me with criticism and disgrace: SAO wasn't inherently bad. It had its flaws and certainly did not meet expectations and hype, but honestly, what did you guys expect? ""Perfect"" anime come once a generation - and though I may have rated more than one 10 myself, that does NOT mean it's perfect, far from it. It's what MY ""perfect"" opinion is. But truly good titles, one that the hivemind agrees on, comes rarely, and if you guys are pasting YOUR idealistic 10 to SAO and trying to
                  figure out why it doesn't fit, then your opinion is more than biased, it's just plain skewed.
I feel like this anime deserves more credit than it has at the moment. Everyone says this, everyone says that - if ""everyone"" dropped off a bridge to fall and die, would you follow without so much as a thought? Of course not. You may teeter on the edge, yearning to follow, but ya don't. So try and take all the hateful responses and think lucidly, as if you had just freshly finished the anime and don't know anyone else's opinions. Hard, I know, but you're more inclined to believe in tandem with the crowd unless you take a step back and breathe your own air.
Story: 6/10
Now that that is out of the way, let's get down to the review. SAO wasn't bad; far from it, actually. It had its WTF moments, but honestly, the people producing anime can't please everyone, and try to direct the show to be in line with their ideals. The storyline, one has to admit, is (decently) unique: by putting on a helmet called the NerveGear, one can be completely (and sensorily, as well) immersed into a virtual world, where sight, touch, sound, smell and taste are all created for your enjoyment. A young guy named Kazuto Kirigaya comes online, and then finds out he cannot log out and reenter reality. That's when all the 10000 gamers realize that they are stuck until the hundredth level is cleared, else you die in the virtual world, your physical body also ceases to exist. Now if that doesn't open up the show quite shockingly, I don't know what does. It's a clear shock moment, one to hook you and drag you into the story. 
And boy was I hooked. Usually action anime take a little while to develop and find its way, to develop the protagonist, to create the arch enemy and sprint towards the climax. SAO skipped all of that and headed straight into the action. What fun! No fillers, no sidestories, no pointless waiting for something to happen - the first episode had me by the fingertips! I was ready to marathon it right then and there.
But whaddya know, all good things must end, eh? The main quest, the fight or die, the survive against the elements and overlords became the sidequest. Kirigaya falls in love, yes, but also does petty missions and rescue events to help the ""damsels in distress."" What. Honestly, this doesn't further the story other than show how awesome the protagonist really is. But we already knew that. Why do we need reinforcement? Sure bits and pieces of the game were brought into the light, but at the cost of these stupid little fillers. Bleh. It detracted from my earlier mood. 
Kirigaya has a constant romance with Asuna, and it gets pretty intense. Except it doesn't. It waxes and wanes, like the battle scenes (which were few and far between, despite this having SWORD in its name). Kirigaya has to juggle a bunch of things at once, women, Asuna, his battles - yay? I guess? It got kind of old as well. When there were action sequences, they were brief, albeit intense moments. But that's all they were, short, abrupt little fight scenes. I wanted a grand battle, a grand climax. Boy, was that hoping for too much?
And when the derailed train of a plot decides to come back onto the tracks, the first arc ends abruptly. What, why, when, HOW? It was just getting good! Things were happening, the ball was rolling towards the finish line, and BAM. It's like right before the winning goal in a football game, some asshole decides to change the channel, then switch back. Sure the end result we see, but we didn't see what led up to right before the climax. I was a little miffed. Surely, after half the series was over, there would be no more mishaps, right?
WHY WAS I WRONG. The second arc put me off. Another game? Another trial? What was wrong with the original story? And then the sister comes into play....that was more unnecessary character development. Why was she even mentioned, let alone play a bigger role than the what the true romance story is? JEALOUSY? This is SAO, not lovey-dovey universe 2 or something like that. And the end was....I can't even say. It was something I didn't expect, nor wanting to expect.
But there were good elements as well. The entire world was well-propagated the entire time, and there were moments of humor where I chuckled aloud. Humor, if used right, can diffuse otherwise high tensions within the story and SAO attempted it, but its effectiveness was limited. The original arc was (counting out those fillers) tense and what I wanted: different. The beginning had me hooked, and the way the characters used menues and the dueling system were all very cool and such. The various guilds and the in-depth research the anime makers used was obvious (I mean, everyone has played an MMO at one point - Maple Story, WOW, even Runescape) and well incorporated into the theme.
Art: 9/10
I think if the artists and storymakers switched places, this would have been a FANTASTIC anime, but weird and boring artistic style. Because dang, that art was sexy. I can't even begin to describe the stunning visuals I experienced. The environment, the virtual fantasy world, was brilliantly designed. The colors, gorgeous, the scenery, exquisite. Even the food looked too good to be true; everything, visually, was top-notch. The battle scenes, like I said I would have liked to see more, not just for the mere action or testosterone pumped yells, but because it was beautiful. SAO made fighting look like a graceful art, dancing against the enemy, dueling rather than simplistic fighting. The characters were drawn pretty plainly, but the hair styles of the girls was a little unique, especially Asuna's hair styles. The uniforms and variety of people and their clothing was shockingly diverse, and each town, the floors shown, the items in the game, everything was drawn perfectly and had its functions clearly designated for them. The art, in its own sense, was beautiful. 
Sound: 9/10
Also a saving grace. The music was written for something epic, and SAO delivered decently well. Though not used that effectively, I found it very accurately portrayed and through it all, used well in conjunction with the various going-ons the entire time. The fight scenes had zest, the romantic scenes with trepidation, and simply music when one character was strolling through town all were well-rounded. I should have paid more attention to the voice-actors, something many forget, but this takes into account even them. Each character portrayed his or her emotions well - if I had watched SAO with my eyes closed, I could probably accurately tell each and every one of their facial expressions and whether tears were rolling or not. Simply great stuff. Also, the sound effects were a touch one shouldn't forget, either. The sounds of battle all the way up to when the wind whistled through the trees was varied and accurate. Good stuff.
Characters: 6/10
This, unfortunately, was why it fell so flat so quickly. While likable, the Kirigaya stayed mainly the same throughout, and changed only when he really need to...and it wasn't really a change. Though he did have the talents and characteristics of a hero, I feel like his entire character dynamic was pretty static, and he needed something really crazy to change who he was. Asuna, the next big character, showed potential early on, but then became a sideshow, and eventually the princess locked in a tower thing. Her role, at best, was minimal save for the beginning, parts of the middle, and the end. Not minimal to the main character, but minimal for the watcher. The various other characters (the swordmaker, the cutesy girl, Sugu) all kind of....were pretty one-faced too. And the other character arcs seemed only to reconnect whenever it was convenient. Whatever happened to the first friend he made? He showed up maybe twice before the series ended. That friendship should have been stronger. But like I said, what was great potential turned into a huge disappointment, and this is where an anime is supposed to shine: in characters one can relate to. 
Overall: 7/10
Now this seems a little higher than what it should be, and no I'm not averaging all the numbers I have. I feel like this deserved credit because it was a ""good"" anime, just not ""great"" nor ""fair."" It deserves a higher title for the music and artwork, voice acting, attention to detail, but loses its sheen and luster to lack fo storytelling, some stupid plots, and random character intrusions by people who are simply not needed. Like a plain cheese pizza that at first tastes delicious but loses its flavor after the first slice because it's so uniform, SAO was good, but not terrific. And people are slamming it harder than it needs to be, because it didn't live up to some ridiculous standars. I went in with no bias, and came out as honest as I could, but an opinion is an opinion. But for me, this is enough MMOs for me. I need to disconnect, run outside, and breathe in reality.",7

                Scoring Preconditions: While I rate all parts, the overall score takes in most consideration from story, character, and enjoyment. Art and sound are not factors in the overall, although they can slightly enhance or detract from enjoyment portion. I score from as unbiased a view as possible and I view it in a critical sense, not in a simple enjoyment sense. Thus I give at most a one point overall bonus for enjoyment. Story and characters matter most. I will state if exceptions to this rule depending on the anime.
Summary: SAO clearly divides opinion among a lot of people. It's considered both a masterpiece and
                  a disaster at the same time. Personally I don't consider this as one or the other. It has both endearing and atrocious parts so I think they cancel in what I consider an average anime. Essentially, what it lacks in story and character, it makes up in enjoyment. Details to follow.
Story (5/10): Let's be frank, the story isn't original at all and it didn't enhance the story setting at all. If you think about it, getting trapped in a video game and fighting your way through many levels is pretty much your standard RPG for anime device. Heck I can do the same on my phone minus the whole I lost my head in the game. Virtual reality may be cool, but Accel World did the same to much better effect. The story basically is fight through one  game, fight through another, beat the bad guy and Kirito is the big hero. Pretty cliche if you ask me. And the while there was closure at the end, the whole Kirito wielding the knife scene was major bs.
Art (10/10): The art style was invigorating. Enhanced the overall enjoyment.
Sound (10/10): Opening themes were good. Both Innocence and Crossing Field are in my playlist. Other sound effects enhanced enjoyment.
Character (5/10): Ordinary. That word just about sums up Kirito, Asuna, and every other character in this anime. You basically have Kirito, who would be an otherwise failure in life getting to play hero in the one thing he's good at: video games. Asuna conveniently is the rich hot shot chick that got stuck and some how falls in love with Kirito. I find it ridiculous that them loving in virtual reality translates to the real world too. As for character development, Kirito plays the whole loner badass character and I didn't really buy it. Asuna has no character development. Oh and the whole jacked up love triangle with Kirito's cousin rang some alarm bells. I'm sorry but incest docks points in my book. The other side characters were simply side characters. Not much to say about them. And finally, the whole taking care of the in game fairy like a child... teenage pregnancy anyone? I mean this is some jacked up stuff if Kirito and Asuna want to be mommy and daddy at age 16.
Enjoyment (8/10): For all the lack of plot and story, I still found great entertainment out if which is probably down to the fact its a virtual reality setting. It may be unoriginal, but that doesn't make it boring. The experience is enjoyable and I thought the fight scenes were up to snuff. While I did criticise the romance, it still warmed my heart. But mostly I give credit to the setting than to any intricacies of the anime. Which is why it doesn't receive perfect marks in this category.
Overall (6/10): Story and characters are mediocre. It was fun and endearing to watch, but from a critical point, it's a basic anime. It isn't an eyesore like some that I watched, but neither was it anywhere near cracking the higher ranks. It makes up for story and characters with enjoyment which is why the overall isn't a 5.
Thanks for reading this. I'm open for discussion so if you have anything to add, message me and I will get back to you.",6

                SAO is an unfortunate case. (This review may contain SLIGHT spoilers) I don't care what the general consensus is, in fact I don't really know what it is. This is not a biased nor emotionally driven review. Simple opinion.
While it has a great premise and interesting foundation, the entire story is rushed and plays out much more like a timeline than a storyline. This combined with the horrible character development and seemingly on-the-fly decisions made by the writers, creates a very shallow shell of what could actually have been a very decent anime.
By far the most detrimental to the enjoyment of the series is their
                  character progression and development. The writers keep about 2 of the main characters in the mix and then circulate new characters every couple episodes. I say this quite literally because they give you approximately one to two episodes to ""get to know a character"" before they trade it for another.
What is further embarrassing is the attempt to throw in romance into the series, which I usually don't have a problem with/or enjoy. Instead, it's a half-baked addition to the story that they seem to throw in just to grab that type of audience ""in case you're into that"". The characters go from stranger, to in love to married in a matter of a couple episodes with a very half-assed reasoning behind it.
Another thing to consider is the fact that the entire series is confusing, as it seems sometimes that the writers have never played an MMO to realize how ridiculous some of the angles are that they take. At the same time, I was surprised on occasion at the accuracy they would have regarding how online games work. Very strange that it's so hot and cold regarding the accuracy and believability.. almost seems like multiple writers combining good and bad ideas to create this inconsistent product. Some ideas that actually made it into the show are downright absurd.. others being borderline.
Overall, it seems like the entire anime is driven off premise alone, and even that is not enough to keep me engaged. So much cliche is bound to turn me off, and with nothing else to hold onto, it's hard to finish. That being said, I will finish the last few episodes just to have said I've done it.
Would not recommend, but it's short enough to justify finding out yourself.
EDIT: After finishing the series, there is not much else to say about this anime. What I will say is that it gradually gets better in the finale of the series, but still does not do enough to make up for the shallowness of the entire series. I liked the final couple episodes in contrast to the early part of the season, but overall I felt a sigh of relief as soon as it was over. That is a bad sign in my book.
I won't be watching SAO2, I don't think. Maybe if I read very positive reviews from people who were critical on the first season. I don't feel like anybody who gave this anime a very high score is being at all constructive. To each their own, though.",5

                Story: 
Akira Toriyama, widely known for the mature tone and complex plots that his productions always have, really stepped it up this time to make a masterpiece. From beginning to end, Sword Art Online always sticks to its brilliant premise: The art of sword fighting in the online universe. Even when they transitioned to elf heim online for the second half, the creators never tried to make the show something that it isn’t. Sword art online is a success story of a promising premise developed correctly. If you liked the trailer/first episode of Sword art online, I guarantee that you won't be disappointed by the
                  rest of the anime!
The first half of Sword Art Online was an emotional roller-coaster where I was laughing, crying, angry, frustrated, skeptic, thoughtful, scared, and horny all in the same scene, kind of reminiscent of the time I watched The Wiggles, another notable work from Toriyama. Above all else, it was well planned. I did not feel the main plot was rushed or brushed to the side like I do in some other anime. The pacing was chronological and consistent. The plot twists were also really key in driving the story; they were unpredictable and entertaining, always leaving me wanting more. Perhaps the best part of the story was the fact that, unlike many other anime, SAO does not leaving anything unexplained. All plotholes are artistically packed and sealed with undeniable logic and realistic reasoning. 
Toriyama, when asked in an interview how he initially came up with the idea of a second arc, gave a proud smile and replied ""Well I was reading my favorite book, The City of Bones from the Mortal Instrument series, a real philosophical classic, when I thought, what if I take the heart-rending incestuous love in this book and apply it to anime? And thats exactly what the second half of the anime is."" The second half of the anime is widely acclaimed as even better than the flawless first half and completely necessary (like Deathnote). Toriyama, when asked in an interview why Kayaba decided to entrap the minds of thousands of gamers rather than just live life as a revered multimillionaire inventor, gave a proud smile and stared at the interviewer.
There has been a misconception that Sword Art Online has elements of romance. That is false. Sword Art Online is 100% action; the glory tale of a dedicated gamer on his way to the top (of the tower). As the epic feats accumulate and the bosses get stronger, a deeper, more intricate plot unravels itself. The sheer amount of testosterone radiating from this anime makes girls grow biceps on their arms and guys grow tumors on their testicles. It should be stashed away and protected as a classic epic to be shown to aboriginal children during their ceremony into manhood.
10/10
Art:
The art in Sword Art Online is good. No seriously, it’s well-animated and decently drawn. It was flashy and pretentious, but maintains a solid MMORPG feel. Some of the female characters could have been more uniquely identifiable; My memory of most of the secondary female characters in the side plots which take place episodes 1-25 are strictly limited to cliche anime eyes, underage, annoying squeeky voice, and either a color topic of purple or red/pink. 
10/10
Sound:
The sound was fantastic, especially in the dub!
I really liked the way all the female characters sounded unique from one another as they all asked Okazaki, I mean kirito, help them with their problems. In fact, sometimes, when I go to sleep at night, I can still hear their voices calling to Kirito: 
""Hey, listen! Hey, listen! Hey listen!""
Ahh what a wonderful sound that is.  
The battle music was really good too and one particular opera song had an odd knack for predicting what your favorite drinks are.
10/10
Character:
The characters are where this show really shines. It was a really good move by Toriyama to make the main character someone the intended audience could connect with. Kirito is just your average gamer: Smart, fit, talented, good-looking, chick-magnet, badass, and probably going somewhere in life. At level 36, all basement-dwellers evolve into Kirito, it’s just a matter of time. 
In terms of development, SAO easily has the best character development I've seen in years. Kirito starts as an over-powered, over-knowledgeable introvert and ends as an over-powered, over-knowledgeable introvert. Asuna starts from an independent, mysterious anti-heroine and ends as a dependent, predictable damsel. Akihiko Kayaba starts as a genius multi-millionaire inventor and ends as a butterfree. 
The love between Asuna and Kirito felt really real! I felt like I could really connect with their relationship because in middle school I had a similar relationship to that of asuna and kirito with my pet parrot. On the surface we were strangers and cold to each other but when I fed her tasty bread with special dipping we got closer. We spent more time together and even got married. Eventually we slept with each other and gave birth to tinkerbell.
The villains are also ruthless, manipulative, cunning, yet connectable.
10/10
Enjoyment: 
One of my acquaintances told me he had a gut feeling that he wouldn’t enjoy the anime. I promptly shot him in the gut and knocked him unconscious with a quick blow to the temple. As he lay there, unconsciously bleeding to death, I softly whispered to him that I enjoyed the anime while holding his intestines in my hands. He now lies at the bottom of a nearby lake, gutless.
10/10 
Overall:
All in all, Sword Art Online 100% lives up to its hype and easily deserves more fans than it has right now. If you liked sword art online, you have great tastes and are probably a functional contributor to society. Other forms of entertainment you might like include Lemon Party and Maplestory.

                I definitely struggled with deciding on how I felt about SAO. At the start of the anime, it definitely had potential. As an online gamer myself, it was really exciting to watch that world brought to life in a way. Unfortunately, it dwindled from there. - contains some minor spoilers - 
Many people have great issues with this anime due to the cliche main hero who dashingly saves the damsel in distress, who swoons for the handsome man in black. Overall, I personally didn't mind the excessive ""Kirito-loving"" for the beginning half of the anime. I rolled my eyes at times and puzzled over the
                  fact that cute girls starred in a single episode and then never showed up again, but overall the romance and the characterization didn't bother me too much. I was enjoying the virtual world being brought to life and comparing the SAO world to my own online experience. The story line was a little too romantic for me, and I would've wished for a more action-centered anime (which is what I originally thought I was getting into), but I still enjoyed it. 
And then came the second season, which I sometimes wish I hadn't watched. It ruined the show for me. I spent the last season staring at the screen and shaking my head trying to figure out how this anime went so wrong so fast. SAO took what seemed like every cliche fan fiction romance story line and thrust it into their second season like it was grappling for something to hold onto. The characters went from being okay to being downright awful. This catastrophe began with the beginning romance between Kirito and his sister (though they explained that away as being okay since they weren't really related). It then proceeded to devolve even more with the love triangle and the evil villain trying to marry Asuna whilst keeping her trapped in the virtual world. SAO then added in blatant fan service and decided to finish with a sweeping ending of disappointment. 
I definitely think that this anime had great potential in the beginning. I had come in expecting an action-packed fighting anime in a virtual world with fights similar to the online gaming experience. In some parts I did get a similar feeling, but the main focus of romance shoved this away. Sadly, I feel like SAO fell apart and lost its focus somewhere along the way. I kept changing my rating for this anime mostly because I feel like the second half of the anime deserves a 2 while the first half deserves a 6. The art was good, and pleasing to the eye, and I enjoyed the soundtrack, both deserving of a 7. The characters were mediocre at best and I gave them a 3. My enjoyment slowly decreased throughout the show and I ended up with a 2 by the end, but I feel like overall it deserved a 5.
So in the end I gave the anime a 5, which is attributed to the first season and my enjoyment of it because of my connection to the gaming aspect. I feel that anyone with that experience will at least enjoy the first season so I decided that it deserves that much. My advice would be to not watch the second season as it ruins SAO as a whole, but if you're one of those people (like me) who can't stand to leave an anime unfinished, by all means, go and watch it. Just prepare yourself for a highly disappointing ending.
This is my first review, so thanks for reading and helpful tips are appreciated!",5

                ***SPOILERS***
Do You like plotholes,semi-incests,characters with no development,meaningless episodes which don't contribute to the main story at all and forced ecchi scenes? Perfect anime for you my m8. Let's take a look at how an anime with unlimited potential became a shitty harem fail.
Audio/Art.   8.8/10
The Sound effects and art are slightly above average by todays standards with pretty good sound fx and some scenes which look nice. The voice actors fit well on the characters. 
Plot.             8.6/10
So it's basically a guy gamer who is perfect at gaming get's trapped inside a game
                  along with many other players and cannot return back to the real world without completing the game and defeating the final boss who is the creator of the game. The catch being that if a player dies in-game the person dies in real life. Now that's edgy as fuck.The plot is good and held a lot of potential as well as a platform of development for anyone.
Characters
Kirito  2/10
So this nigga is the main character. A guy who isn't actually good at anything in real life but man-o-man does he play dem videogames all day long. He is perfect at anything and evrything in-game. He does not need any improvement and hence he is a boring,soulless character. I guess the writers thought that it would make him look like some kind of dark,edgy,badass and lone wolf kind of person which failed miserably.Itachi would be a good character to describe as said above.He is not likable at all and wished Klein had more screen-time than this fgt. For some reason all thr girls are after his dick too.His love for Asuna seems very forced and feels like he uses her just to keep company. Oh wow you saved my life i am in love marry me pls hurr durr.A 2/10 because he didn't bone his cousin even though she had a pretty thick ass.
Asuna.  5/10
She a somewhat kawaii main girl character. She is pretty strong and probably the popular kind of character in real life. At first I was happy to not see a damsel in distress scene and thought i wouldn't have too either but i was wrong. like any other cliched action anime she ended up  being the damsel. At least she is not perfect and love from her side seems somewhat legitimate.
Klein.     10/10
Rip Klein the only nigga who actually could've been a good character but only got like 2 seconds of screentime.He actually had a personality and genuine frelings of concern. He had a lot of room of development as he was a n00b but that's ok. Still better than Shitito.
That Fairy Daughter AI Thing.    0/10
I don't remember her name,but she isn't real was AI to moniter the Aincrad system. for some gay ass reason she is in the form of a small girl child (literally worst grill in series). Again for some shit reason the AI ""girl"" was unconscious in a forest where our two lovely characters find her and decide to take her in as their daughter (It's a extremely predictable scene). Once in a dungeon Shitito and Assuna can't defeat a high level monster and there you have the good ol' gears of deus ex machina spinning like crazy. The girl kills the monster and suddenly ""remembers"" that she is a program and starts saying she is fake including her emotions. wow. not a nice meme bro.She was soon going to be deleted by the system for interfering in the game and Asuna starts crying and shit but don't worry the holy gears of deus ex machina stop for no one as Shitito goes to a console and starts modding/hacking the game (idk how that shit works but ok) and converts the girl into a teardrop shaped pendant and saves her before getting deleted. (If that isn't one of the shittiest developments in an anime then get out of my face you weaboo scum).She basically is also a cheat devicd since she is AI.
Other Unimportant Characters Who Don't Deserve To Be Remembered 
The characters whose team Shitio was in died in like one episode and weren't even good and don't contribute to the story overall. That one loli who gets an irrelevant episode,that other girl who makes a sword and also isn't relevant or of any significance. And all the other people who died.I almost forgot about Shititos cousin sis who basically wants his dick and helps him in-game and is also part of a irrelevant semi-incest romance development. rip
The Antagonist No 1.    0/10
This guy is pretty bad for an antagonist. He forgets why he made a video game,traps thousands of people in it while risking their lives and future just so that he could be killed inside a video game. Nice.
The Antagonist No 2.      -5/10
He is a pathetic ass fuckhead who is literally the worst antagonist i have ever seen. All he is after is Asunas pussy.Both in real life and in-game which is sad. He apparently runs a big company because of which Asuna is alive in real life and wants to marry Asuna. Asunas dad doesn't seem to mind.nice. She is like 17 or some shit and the guy is like 25.Is the dad autistic or something,is this the development the writers of one of the ""best"" anime can come up with?Let me kill myself real quick.
Plotholes and Unecessary Developments
Buckle up m8 we gonna go on and review a lot of shit now.
1. Why didn't Kirito OR Asuna die when the   they were clearly killed. How come did both of them survive?Why did kirito come back to life? You know why?  Because this is a shit anime that's why.
2.How come at the beginning episode 3 he is at level 40 and by the end of the 
episode it is at level 70? What the fuck?
3. How the fuck can kirito hack the game from a console inside the game? Like oh look a console let's hack shit.
4. Why are so many levels in the game skipped and have unnecessary people who contribute literally nothing except the harem concept?
5. Why was Asuna the only one who wasn't the only one who didn't log out and how the fuck did she get transported to completely different game?
6. How come did Shitito still have his gaming stats (ATK,DEF,SPEED etc) even after going to a different game?
7. How could Shitito defeat one of the most powerful characters in the new game even when he hadn't played much?
8. Why does the cousin love him and it wouldn't have made a difference even if she didn't love him so why the shitty love triangle incest?
9.  How did the parents of Asuna not have a problem with her getting married or even think of it when she is trapped in a game with no guarantee of even surviving?
Overall   1/10
1 because kirito controlled himself from banging his hoe of a sis.
If you even think this anime deserves a score more than 2 at tops watch better anime you trashy ass weeaboo",2

                I went to watch SAO without knowing any of the talk about it or the stuff about it being on of the most overrated series. After watching it I had a lot to say. First of all, the setting is great. The idea of being in a game is pretty interesting and appeals to many gamers. 
The story really follows all the gamers escaping after understanding that death is very real in the game and there are numerous opponents which could cause that. 
Now the characters. The characters were absolutely HORRIBLE. Kirito is a guy who gets all the bitches, is overpowered, and has 0
                  development at all. Really boring and unlikable. 
Asuna was great in the beginning. But she seemed to get weaker from her relationship with Kirito. The love in SAO was really annoying. It's super unrealistic and badly written. Asuna seemed to be the independent and strong character but fell to be a weak damsel in distress. 
Yui was so unnecessary. They put her in there to make the romance even more stupid. There's nothing to like about her and she reminds me a lot of the ""hey! Listen! Hey listen!"" stuff from Legend of Zelda. They tried so hard to appeal to emotion but it was really poor.
The animation and sound were impressive though. Anything from LiSA has always been great and the bright colors to SAO adds on to the beautiful setting.
Overall, it really is overrated and is just cheap romance. Strong setting, poor story, beautiful animation and sound, horrendous characters.",2
"
                Sword Art Online is probably one of the most hyped up animes of 2012. The anime itself is amazing.... for the first two episodes...
The plot and character all seem very enthralling in the first episode. The plot of being stuck in a game and dying in it means real death and there is no escape unless you beat it is a great plot! However, this plot quickly falls apart after the third episodes and onwards. Our main character Kirito is what you might expect. A brash, somewhat arrogant, masculine and gets all the girls but doesn't seem to care, type of character. This itself is
                  not the problem, it is the characters around him. The first girl you meet which is a cute girl with a dragon, you see her for two-ish episods and she never appears. There are numerous characters they could've expanded on, but didn't and the majority of the characters, you never see again for the rest of the anime. There is no real character development for Kirito, and its rushed. The romance is all right, it's a somewhat tsundere romance, but for some reason, they decide to get married not even 5 days into their relationship. The characters are very rushed and overall, everything is very rushed. There was a lot they could've expanded on, but didn't. They complete like 10 floors in one episode and the character is quite predictable. The reason why I gave the story a 7 was because the story isn't bad, its the way they executed it was bad.
The plot is very creative, I won't deny that, but the characters themselves are probably the biggest flaw in the series, along with the rushed part of it. Now, fortunately, SAO compensates that, for its relatively good soundtrack and good animations. The battles are lively and vivid and the sound is quite action-packed and energizing. These all stand a pretty good score of 8.
With that, SAO, is an anime that I find I enjoy even though I don't like the characters much. The reason why I enjoy it is because the story is quite good after Episode 15, when they complete the Sword Art Online game and begin another game to save *spoiler* Asuna. After that, the anime dives into the characters of Kirito's ""sister"" and the rest of the cast, but for the ones you meet in SAO, consider them seen once, and never seen again.
Overall, SAO is not a horrible anime. It had a lot of potential that wasn't used. The execution is quite bad, but the creative story, sound, art somewhat makes up for it, and plus after Episode 15, I found it much better.",7

                Sword Art Online immediately impressed me at first sight. Anyone who have at least once played a MMORPG would definitely love the concept. I mean, who wouldn't? It would be a lie to say that you never wanted to be in a video game before... or at least thought about it.
Unfortunately, the impression shattered like a wine glass fell to the floor after episode 3. What a buzzkill that was...
To avoid spoilers, I will not go into details. I shall proceed to the review:
Story 6/10
Despite having a brilliant premise of being stuck in a virtual world, the story isn't all that great. The Aincrad arc
                  progressed too fast in my opinion. There's 100 floors dammit! Let us enjoy the surroundings a bit.
The thing that ticked me off the most is the storytelling. For some reason, I felt like the author just threw me around Aincrad and Kirito was just there (somehow...). Then some events unfolded (mostly drama) and awesome BGM tell you what to feel. I honestly didn't like that.
The story got a little bit better during the Alfheim arc, just a bit.
This story lacks goal in my opinion. It just can't compete compared to becoming a Hokage, Pirate King or Shinigami related stuffs... Then again, this is my thoughts on the story.
Art 8/10
The art is good to my eyes. No complaints whatsoever.
Sound 9/10
I think the VA did one hell of a job portraying the characters. Plus, the BGM is awesome as well as the OP/ED songs. But, I am an audiophile...
Characters 5/10
The characters are way too normal except for Asuna and Kirito, which is way too superior compared to everyone else. It felt like reading a Mary Stu/ Gary Stu fanfiction but I just can't flame it... The protagonist didn't undergo much adversity at all!! Kirito is just - fortunately - too awesome because he was a beta player. On the top of my head, I can't recall a single moment when Kirito lost in a fight... he wins all the way.
Asuna was apparently Kirito waifu for some reason... (yeah right!)
Compared to all the other female characters, she's the most beautiful, strongest, fastest,  of all.
Enjoyment 6/10
Meh...
Overall 6/10
It's fair enough to count as an anime. Not a good one though...
It's overly-hyped.",6

                If SAO was a band,it'd be called One Direction ...Loved by their fans but considered overrated by everyone else..And i belong to the latter category...
So here's my review:
Story: 5/10
Honestly,i loved the first few episodes of SAO..the art was great,the characters seemed fun and the pacing was good...But somewhere along the way,SAO lost its touch..It became another cliched romance with the hero saving the girl,girl and hero kissing and then living happily as a couple..And they even added in a virtual child so that the family roleplay can be complete...The romance kiiled the show for me...It was way too fast,way too unrealistic and way too cliched
                  and it firmly put the breaks on a plot which was steamrolling its was towards greatness..By the end,they managed to get the plot back on track but it was too little too late as far as i'm concerned..
On the whole,story gets a 5/10
Art:10/10
The art was the best part of the show..Some of the animations particularly the landscapes and the fight scenes were excellent and for me its one of the best animated series in recent years..So a 10/10
Sound:6/10
The Ost was nothing to write home about..It wasnt terrible but thats about it..The voice acting for the main Asuna and Kirito was well matched though and thats about it..V.A gets a 7/10 and Ost gets a 5/10..So sound gets  a 6/10
Character:6/10
They gave plenty of screentime to Kirto and Asuna and so it made it easier for their characters to be well fleshed out...But the side characters were more or less ignored..Cartoonish villain,friends who pop up once a while to help Kirito and a sister who has feelings for her brother(not exactly her brother since he's adopted..Well,who saw that coming??),said sister's friend who has mad crush on sister but gets constantly friendzoned..the side characters are about as cliched as it gets and scenes involving them often made me  question why i was still watching this show
Enjoyement: 4/10
Besides the wonderful art,i really didnt enjoy anything else about this 
Overall:
6/10
Some animes live up to their hype ...SAO was not one such anime..Watching SAO made me wonder what is the secret factor that makes average anime overhyped ..I guess i'll be searching for that answer for quite sometime!",6
"
                CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS.
With so many reviews with a huge standard deviation all around MAL for SAO, let me join the bandwagon of SAO review writing competition! Actually I am copy pasting one of my forum posts that got buried under 30+ pages. Yeah, SAO hit 25-30 pages on average in MAL forums per episode during its run. This anime drew attention of both admirers and haters alike.
I don't really hate it. Rather I would say I disliked it. Not because it is overly hyped and I am one of those who hate things which are liked by the mass. If you see my anime list
                  you'll probably notice that most of the highly rated anime in MAL and in other anime db sites have pretty good scores from me. So why SAO got a 5/10 from me (and I was being generous for an anime that gave me unwanted lols)? 
SAO is a mess. Yes. The proper words for it. A MESS. The only good points of the anime are the animation of the surrounding, the environment, the background details, and the music. It makes you want to be in those fantasy worlds. The idea of realistic virtual world pulls the people into the anime and death in the game is death in real world, pretty much the scorers for the anime.
Everything else, the hollow characters, the ridiculous character interactions, their out of screen development, the randomness of the storytelling, the bizarre pacing of the anime, every single female character having a thing for the main guy, the male side characters being pansies, everything that I seek in an anime to give it a decent score is at shambles. 
This anime could have been a great anime. The plot had an enormous potential to make it one of the best anime in years. But what we got instead? If anything other than a mess, I would say it has been a comic relief, just that it wasn't meant to be funny. I ROFL in so many incidents while in others, I did facepalms. Something you really don't expect from an anime that gives the vibe of a very serious story line. Ironically, it tried to be funny at times, but those moments were far from anything funny.
So here is a new take on writing a SAO review. Let me break it down to the genres that it acclaims since no one has done it.
Original Genres: 
Action: Half-assed most of the time, overly glorified at times, like someone blowing up when struck by a sword for instance that didn't go unnoticed for many during the ALO arc. Also, A1-Pictures and the facial expressions during high frame-rate action scenes. You probably already know the rest. Score: 5/10
Adventure: Jumping from here and there, more specifically, from level to level. Oh yes, bloody amazing adventure: you just get to know which level they are at, and that's bloody that. No way someone's going to show all 75 levels, right? But hey, why not just do that in such a way that the coherency of the story is there or at least try to make it free-flowing? Score: 2/10
Fantasy: A definite plus of the anime. Maybe the only true genre it has covered properly. SAO arc had some of the best landscapes drawn in an anime made for TV broadcasting. Even though the landscapes lacked creativity, completely ripped off of other fantasies, just that they were animated vividly, which were definitely a plus for the anime. Score: 8/10
Game: Fair enough. They were indeed playing a game. A life threatening one too. Just saying. Score: 7/10
Romance: Okay. It is somewhat proven that when people are at loss, they seek comfort, strive for human warmth. They just want to know that there is someone who would care for them before losing their sanity. I really don't care how Asuna and Kirito started liking each other since I believe falling in love can take years, or just a matter of moments. I think the most romantic moment of the anime was when Asuna cried and said she wanted to grow old with Kirito in the real world. At that point of time, anything simple would have been pretty good for a romance substance but to do that, the animators pushed everything they could think of to make Asuna look a bit too dreamy. She is beautiful, comes from a good background, loving, caring, considerate, good at cooking, good at fighting, and add another twenty things as you wish, and she is basically the most flawless female character you need to make a successful romance story. Like seriously? In an attempt to oversize the romance, an attempt was made to look Asuna a bit too perfect and in the end making her a weak character who was initially shown as quite the dependable and strong character. Asuna pathetically became a tool for romance. And subsequently...*(continue reading or scroll down to asterisk) Score: 3/10 (And I am a fan of romance in anime too.)
Genres it conveniently overlooked:
Harem: Every single female character out there is going after Kirito apparently because he is the gameliest of gamers. Oh wait! I forgot about this character named Yuriel who actually had someone else she liked other than Kirito. And what did we get? Just because she is not meant to be one of Kirito's harem, she has a face of Nizuma Eiji. Score: 9/10. Definitely a Harem anime.
Shounen: Overcome every single obstacle by powering up from God Know where from because Kirito happened to have played the game before as a beta tester and have better reflex (my arse). What the fuck have the rest of the gamers been doing throughout their miserable lives? They just get pawned out of nowhere every time because they are just some random gamers. Score: 7/10 
Comedy: Why? Because the anime is full of craziest comedies even though you probably wouldn't want to watch them in an anime set with such serious tone. Even in the final episode when the rapist of rapers missed Kirito by half a meter, he didn't forget to mention that his eyes were playing tricks on him. I literally ROFL. If they make a sequel, which is very likely to happen, I, if for anything, will watch this anime for all the random LOLs. Score: 9/10. 
Incest: Okay. Yeah she is a cousin so it doesn't really matter. But they grew up together as siblings even if they are not blood related. It is understandable that suddenly knowing that the one you have lived with wasn't your sibling may result in unsettling emotional state of mind. So I would have stroke it out for decency's fuck. But I didn't. Know why? I never say bad things about female chest. But the way they emphasized on Sugu's BOOBs was annoying to watch as a human being but enjoyable at the same time being a guy. Score: 8/10.
Ecchi: Scientists given tentacles in their avatars in the game? LIKE WHAT THE FUCK? But if you think logically, it all makes sense. They really need to grab Asuna in way that would make you drop a bit of your manhood. But from the business point of view, I say A-1 picture did fucking brilliant. (Continued from the asterisk from above!) *They even ended up making Asuna a raping bag. I am sure every otaku is buying 10 pieces of this crap using their parents' money. No, it wasn't meant to be a racist comment, but that's how they portray the otakus in general, so take my sincere apology for saying such an obnoxious thing. Score: 10/10.
When an anime drifts away from its original genres and scores higher on other *hidden* genres, you must know that the anime if anything, is a complete train wreck.  
And thus the anime gets a 5/10 from me. 
I haven't read the Light Novel, so it is pointless to judge it from the LN's point of view. No matter how good the LN may be, the anime is probably just a very bad adaptation if anything.
If you have tons of anime to watch in you list, you should avoid watching this anime unless:
1. You really don't have anything else to watch (your list of completed anime is touching 4 digits).
2. You crave for popular (not necessarily good) anime.
3. You are a Masochist (deciding to watch an anime that is bombarded with low scores by majority of the reviewers).",4

                The Adventures of Gary Stu and his friends - The Animation.
He can do everything, convenient turns in the plot and plot devices for everything. If you are 16 or lower, you should watch this. If you are 18 or higher and you watch this, grow up already.
The music is just like everything done by Kajiura, only Madoka Magica sounds sort of different. The art is great though.
Also, SAO ended in ep14 for me.
              ",3
"
                The adaptation Sword Art Online is truly an overwhelming spring of enjoyment to me.
At this time, I've seen the 10 episodes available and read the first volume of the LN. Since SAO hasn't been completed yet, reviews may lack of accuracy regarding Story/Art/Sound/Character so I'll mostly focus on the Enjoyment as far as it has reached and a short talk about the adaptation from the LN (sorry if things get mixed).
Sword Art Online is a Medieval/Fantasy/Adventure genre that exhibit its charm through landscapes, short-quest stories and a MMORPG reference. As a former hardcore-player of this category, SAO has created a sweet and burning nostalgia :
                  from the first sensation of discovering the game and killing our first mob, to the latter of being the worst player farming day and night to receive the prestige and amazement of being part of the strongest group. This, and the hardship of players to reach the top, whilst giving up on friends, chat and party to focus on getting the experience is, no matter the differences, how I saw myself through Kirito.
To me, Sword Art Online will achieve something Zero no Tsukaima, Erementar Gerad, Fairy Tail and many other anime failed to do : create the best fantasy plot and circumstances to bring life to a main Hero.
CHARACTERS : 9.5/10
Kirito - the main protagonist, is a character with the heroic allure : kind, smart, confident and strong-willed. He's young and yet, he will keep going and easily learn from mistakes. That's how perfect he is, how unrealistic this show is, but how inspired he has risen me : Kirito is like a heroic role model to me.
Asuna - I'll skip through this one, Asuna is a cliche ""bit of tsundere"". I'd say I've fallen for her (like I did for so many but that's another story...). Anyway, she's a cliche perfect waifu, nothing that amazing.
Anyone else - I've read a lot of complain about how plain any other characters are. Again, I'm not reviewing the lack of realism (anime aren't focusing on realistic characters), the story is going straight to the main characters, any secondary is just mixed in to alter the main characters behavior.
ART : 8.5/10
As for the main characters, it's perfect ; secondary are fine as well but some of them should have been polished (I'm referring to Cradil and Heatcliff's body that are probably almost the same)
SOUND : 8.5/10
The Opening is awesome every time I'm listening to it ; The Ending was okay and the Seiyu did a really nice job.
Background Soundtracks (OST) are great but lack of variety. ""Acts sounds"" were nicely chosen (Asuna turned so fluffy haha)
STORY (until episode 9) : 8/10
The concept is fresh, but probably revisited (I haven't watched ./hack though). I have that bitter feeling ""I've thought of this kind of story so many times"" : it's absolutely not that original at all.
The trail didn't follow a typical path, with its ""2 years time-skip"", the story went ahead and completely erased the obvious and unnecessary details (I wish I could see a farming session though). Some side-stories created great opportunities to introduce the main character before the main plot and added a spicy Role Playing side-quest reference.
Even so, I was really looking forward a story like this one, most likely the best kind of stories I may enjoy.
ENJOYMENT : 10/10
ADAPTATION : 5/10
SAO anime didn't perfectly follow the Light-Novel sequence, unfortunately it didn't goes so well (reminding past/flash back scene were awful), some consistency ""mistakes"" were also made during that trade (it may be done on purpose to afford ""clin d'oeil"" to readers of the book though). A bunch of precious information and details were skipped as well. Many scenes were getting awful and useless, created bad impression difference with the LN (may be subjective).
However, the sensation to watch it animated with voices and sounds was amazing and exciting.
(btw I've watched 8 episodes first then started reading the LN)
OVERALL :
As for me, this anime is my current favorite, it'll keep shaking my mind for at least a few month.
I'd definitely recommend Sword Art Online if you're fan of MMORPG, Fantasy, Adventure and Heroic melted with a love comedy that may create a small pain in your chest...
The anime isn't as great and perfectly-made as some other recent anime, but it didn't need to be that great ; the flow of actions and excitement is what was important and they completely filled that branch for me.

VRMMORPG or Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Play Game... I wonder if something like this will exist someday...",9
"
                Is this the worst anime ever? No. Is it overrated? Yes.
Let's start with story, which is 3.
Story had great potential, despite the whole idea of being stuck in a game is pretty old. There are two arcs by the way, the first one has 14 episodes. The two episodes were great, and learned us more about how the MMO works and set us up with solid characters. But there it stops. The remaining episodes of the first arc are unnecessary side character episodes, fillers and time skips. Conclusion of first arc can be summed up in three words; 'Deus Ex Machina' Yes, the first arc
                  of the anime had nothing to do with the actual plot.  And it only becomes worse in the second arc. Suddenly the game changes from 'SAO' to 'Mario'. Our main hero has to save his waifu from a castle, while expanding his harem on the way. How he saves her? WITH MORE DEUS EX MACHINA! Also, incest sub-plot and tentacle rape. All logic disappears and our main hero becomes pretty much invincible. However, I guess it's then still an improvement from the first arc since it focuses more on fighting and adventure rather than unnecessary episodes. So, there is also a romance subplot which is no better than Twilight. It feels really unnatural, forced and kind of disturbing considering our main hero has an entire harem by his side.
Well, moving on to characters... a 1.
So, there is a lot of discussion about whether the main hero Kirito/Kazuto is a Gary Stu (FYI, a Gary Stu is a perfect guy) or not. I'm not looking to start a flame war here so I'm not going to give my opinion on it, but it is true that he is pretty OP, never dies, all girls want to have sex with him and defeats MMO bosses SOLO. In the first arc he doesn't have much personality neither, and it only improves slightly in the second arc.
The main heroine is Asuna, who on first sight looks like a badass female gamer... (And a bit of a Mary Sue) She also is for the first episodes, but later she pretty much becomes Kirito's waifu and is completely helpless. She becomes a boring, tsundere and worthless plotdevice that cooks. Yeah, I'm serious, instead of fighting she cooks.
The other characters? Let's see, hmm... Yui is pretty much a cheat device, Suguha is the sister who loves her brother Kirito too much, aaaandd... I completely forgot about the others. The other girls are just there to expand Kirito's harem and the villains are hilarious. (in a bad way)
Art and sound are 8 and 7, nothing wrong here. Bosses are very nicely done, backgrounds are great and shading is nice. Music is fitting.
Enjoyment is 4. Okay, nobody likes main heroes who can't do anything. But nobody likes heroes who beats MMO bosses solo in a minute either. Why? Because it's boring! You can't relate to Kirito or any of the other characters. Some unnecessary episodes will make you facepalm, the villains will make you laugh and sometimes you will even feel disturbed!
Overall is 5. It isn't that bad. Some episodes ARE enjoyable, but not enjoyable enough to make up for all the bad ones. The characters are bad, boring and mostly serve no purpose. If you're a hardcore gamer and think you will enjoy this, think again. This anime will just make you facepalm due to the lack of logic and the overuse of Deus Ex Machina. Best to avoid this, it's not as good as some people make it out to be. The 'strong female character' Asuna is just a big lie. 
This is only about Kirito and his OPness and harem.",5

                *This review may contain spoilers*
Yup, another review of this famous anime. Some people hate this show to death while some people love it and now im going to give you my own perspective of Sword art online. 
(This is my actual first time reviewing an anime so im sorry if i miss out some important point of the show.)
Story / Plot (3/10) : 
So in the future Virtual reality is a thing. Now we have our main character who use this VR called ""Nerve Gear"" to play a MMORPG game called Sword art online. Little did everyone know they are trapped inside the game and
                  if you die in the game, you die in real life and you must clear the game to go back to the real world.
People are saying that the first 14 episode are ""good"" compared to the rest of it. But i find SAO is a bullshit to begin with.
Ok first lets talk about how kirito leveling up.
In the first episode he is level 1, in episode 3 he is level 40, in episode 4 he is level 78 and in episode 10 after the 2 year time skip he is only level 98.  My point here is how someone levels up or what they do to level up is NEVER explained. Same goes to when kirito saved sachi guild is never explained. And then some fanboy of sao told me that Sachi's death is suppose to be sad, but what I didn't know is that Sachi gets less than one episode of development. So how can the death of a character with less than one episode of development be sad ?
This just hurts my enjoyment of the show. Theres way too much plotholes. The plot progression is ridiculous aswell. The only episode that progress the plot is Episode 1, 2, 10, 13 and 14 (we are talking about the aincrad arc). The rest of the aincrad arc episode are fillers. So i find Sword art online is not an anime about a videogame, its a romance that just happens to take place in a videogame. Because its mainly focused on the romance aspect of the anime not the game aspect.
Characters (2/10) :
Now lets move on to the characters. The most bullshit aspect about SAO is the characters. 
Kirito : 
We have our main character here who has no personality whatsoever. He is good at everything he tries for no reason. Not even a single Character development were given to him. And the lack of characterazation. Now lets talk about kirito being a ""Solo player"". Being a solo player on an MMORPG death game is a complete bullshit.
Kirito says that he's a solo player at the end of episode 2, and at the beginning of episode 3 he's in a fucking guild, in episode 4 he team up with silica, in episode 5 & 6 he team up with asuna, in episode 7 he team up with Lizabeth and ONLY at the beginning of episode 8 AFTER the two-year timeskip do we see him alone and at the same episode not only he team up with asuna again but by episode 11 they are fucking married. 
So explain to me why is this stupid little shit keeps saying he's a solo player? Alright because its EDGY. He's edgy because he's alone. What a cool guy. 
Asuna : 
Asuna is there only for the love interest of kirito. She's never shown at anytime dedicating time to fighting. And yet she ""supposely"" popular. For being what?  Asuna cant even do shit without kirito, why is she so popular? What did she do? That is never explained in the anime.
Suguha:
Her main role is providing fanservice and a tacked-on incest subplot. It's simply another element thrown into the plot for cheap shock value, if anyone is still shocked by incest in anime nowadays.
Kayaba Akihiko :
The dumbest antagonist of all time. Kayaba simply forget his motives for doing all what he did in SAO. Never in any other show that i have read or seen has a villiant simply forgotten why they're doing what they're doing.
Lisbeth:
Lisbeth is there only for the jealousy purposes. And waifu bait.
The rest of Kirito harems / side characters are useless and pointless to describe. Each one of them only got 1 episode of characterazation. And its not worth mentioning. The plot can progress without them.
Art (7/10) :
The art is decently good, heck its an original standard of A-1 Pictures.
Soundtrack (8/10) :
Well i must say the soundtrack is above average. Its suit the show really well. Its the only redeeming quality in sword art online. 
Overall (4/10):
Sword art online is a wasted potential. It can be a decent anime but its poorly written. The pacing is absurd. And the bland characters hurts my enjoyment. Its not that suprising if theres a lot people who enjoy this anime. Especially those who are new to anime.",4
"
                Why sword art online is shit.
Story: 2
First of I would like to say that the plot to SAO is completely 100% unoriginal and is mainly the wet dream of a creepy gamer manifested into a shitty anime.
The plot summary of SAO is that people start playing this really realistic game called Sword art online through a new gaming device on the market called the nerve gear, minutes after the game is launched they are trapped in this game, the only way to escape is to complete the game by climbing a massive tower and beating the 100 bosses that make up each floor of the
                  tower.
The story is something you would see in almost EVERY CARTOON EVER, no exaggeration; the premise of people being stuck in a video game might as well have been cut and pasted straight from spongebob or KND. While the whole “stuck in a video game” premise is old and recycled SAO puts more depth into it than you would find in an average TV show, at least in SAO the try to incorporate more features of an actual video game such as parties, clans and potions. 
The story (while unoriginal) is not always the main focus of the anime, some episodes are devoted to things other than attempting to beat the game, one of these sub-plots (they only take up 1 or 2 episodes) is a stupid CSI crime drama where they have to solve a murder, this episode consisted of the most poor and predictable writing in a crime drama I’ve seen. Another sub-plot is a fishing episode, A FUCKING FISHING EPISODE, IN A LIFE OR DEATH GAME, THEY ARE FUCKING FISHING! I believe that these filler episodes are here to give the world of SAO a more realistic feel and that it can relate to the real life world, this is also expressed through the many social interactions in the game as the characters will often meet in “ye old tavern” to drink some mead, I am glad to say that at some moments (NOT ALL) the social interactions of the characters actually make SAO seem serious as they undergo a life or death struggle.
Though all the social interactions in the game make it seem more realistic it doesn’t excuse the atrocious relationship between Asuna and Kirito and how Kirito apparently has a magnet on his dick that attracts every female in the world to magically fall in love with him after spending literally a day with him. The relationship between Kirito and Asuna couldn’t be worse, I swear to god I wanted at least one of them to die by the end of the show. Kirito the awesome, floor clearing badass becomes Asuna’s bitch after they fall in love and doesn’t stop whining about their relationship, the same goes for Asuna, she used to be awesome but then she becomes a whiny teenager who thinks she knows true love as she met her boyfriend in a FUCKING VIDEO GAME! It takes them 2 and ½ years to actually see each other in person.
 Eventually they get married in-game and buy a house in the country side, it’s all nice and dandy in a life or death game not to mention seedy moments from the author including Asuna (a 15 year old girl might I add) taking her clothes off about to have sex with Kirito (a 15 year old as well) and 16.5 (don’t even get me talking about 16.5). BUT it gets worse when they come across their AI daughter named yui who thinks Asuna and Kirito are her parents forcing them into a loving relationship with a daughter, how much more stupid could this show get at this point! And we aren’t even half way through the show.
 Throughout SAO they will throw in stupid time skips to pass the time in the game at one point it’s been 1 year and then the next episode it’s been 2 years, instead of focusing on them clearing the game they decide to focus on the relationship between Kirito and Asuna and it is one of the main reasons this show is as bad as some say.
 Kirito finally makes it out of SAO only to go back into the world of virtual gaming to join a game called Alfhiem online where Kirito (as the gay love struck fairy he is) has to save Asuna (his loving bride) from a bird cage before a butterfly rapes her and fucks with the minds of everyone playing this game. No joking, that is the plot to the 2nd half of SAO, but guess what! In Alfhiem online you can’t die, you just respawn in 60 seconds, WELL there goes all the tension from SAO! Remember the times when people planned their attacks before rushing to their death, now people just run in guns blazing ready to die, there’s also a point where someone is getting robbed (In a video game) and I quote “give us your items or we’ll kill you”… seriously, SHE WILL JUST RESPAWN! I can’t wrap my head around what the author was thinking especially when they disregarded Asuna for Kirito’s cousin, that’s right folks, no there is incest BUT THAT’S NOT ALL.
At one point in the show this guy named shinichi (suguha’s friend) calls suguha (kirito’s cousin) 100 times just so he can cry about something that happened in game, HOW SAD IS THAT! I seriously can’t fathom this show, why, why is this show so stupid?! I don’t know what’s worse, the fact that this show had so much potential or that an endless swarm of people worship this show religiously like it was made by god himself. I won’t spoil anything but the ending to the 2nd half of the show was very satisfying.
Art: 7
While sword art online’s visuals don’t compare to that of attack on titan and bakemonogatari I must commend it because it is above average and definitely stands out in action sequences (which are easily the standing point of the show) something I must say is that while the art style is nice, environment set pieces aren’t very creative as you’ll get lucky if you stumble into a town or cave but most of the time you are looking at plains, lots or plains and fields, Alfhiem online does look very nice though, especially the town and villages, besides that it is just plains and fields with a side of  windy breeze and some lying in the grass.
Sound: 9
The sound for SAO is good, really good the change of pace is perfect as during fights it is fast paced, during CSI detective sequences (ugh) it is a nice slow pondering pace, and the openings for the shows are amazing, especially the first one.
Characters: 2
The worst part of sword art online without a single doubt is the characters, I wanted everyone in SAO to die, I was rooting for the bad guys to win because every single person playing this game has a severe case of stupidity. At first Kirito and Asuna where my favourite characters. But then thy fell in love, Kirito became a bitch and Asuna became more dependant on Kirito, everything I liked about them was taken away from me, shat on and got a little note on it saying “fuck you we prefer our Kirito better”. Then Yui comes along and makes them even worse, instead of Kirito kicking ass he gives piggy back rides and instead of Asuna kicking ass, she sucks dick (16.5). By the end of SAO it went from good – bad – shit – steaming pile of shit – volcanic pile of shit. The show should win an Olympic medal for the best nosedive in history and a military commendation for crushing the spirits of all who watched it. Then in Alfhiem online it got worse by replacing Asuna with his cousin, what the fuck was the author smoking when he made this, was this show all a joke to show humanity how far we can sink? People don’t cry to each other on the phone about a fucking video game! “DU CLAN LEADER ES EVUL UND DES NOTHIN WE CUN DU BOUT IT!”
Though in kirito’s favour he is much better in Alfhiem online as he isn’t Asuna’s bitch for the whole show. The only characters I actually liked where Akihiko kiaba and Nobuyuki Sugou as they were really good villains with half decent plans (who were perfectly voice acted by Mark diraison & Todd Haberkorn). But much worse than the main characters were the supporting characters such as;
The big black guy
The red haired guy
The girl with the dragon
The blacksmith chick
The guy with a bald cut
The cat girl (there has to be at least 1)
The elf guy
Most of these supporting roles got no character development what so ever and were just there so Kirito could add their names to his dick magnet collection of hot chicks playing video games. And seriously I am not sexist or anything but it seems like most of the people Kirito meets are hot chicks with massive breasts playing video games that instantly gravitate to the magnet attached to his dick.
The supporting characters didn’t get enough character development but the main characters got too much to the point that they became parents at the age of 16.
Enjoyment: 4
The sole reason I am giving this category a 4 is because of all the laughter and entertainment I got out of this show, it was so stupid I just had to boost this up from a 2, while the show is stupid and random time skips did the opposite of keeping me on the edge of my seat I couldn’t help laughing at the sheer stupidity of this show. So yes it was enjoyable, very enjoyable in fact but in a bad way a very bad way.
Overall: 3
SAO is the perfect example of wasted potential, it could have been good but they decided to focus more on the cringe worthy relationship between Asuna and Kirito than the actual story and character development. While It tried it’s hardest to replicate serious gaming it went to the point at which it was incredibly stupid and even laughable. What could have been good was thrown in the trash and replaced with the wet dream of a pervy gamer and for that reason I am giving it a 3.
Average: 4.5",3

                Well let's get ready for reviewing SAO .It's pretty disappointing tome but pls bear with it. I might ended up comparing it with other animes like AW but pls bear with me :)) 
Story(3/10)
A very poor storyline... well it's kinda cool when they only say you need to beat the game to log out and it'll be a death game.. well it become interesting but as series progresses well it's plain boring... BORING!!... well most of the girls here fell in love with Kirito in just one day... well it's kinda like harem.. It might be better if they turn it into an ecchi anime
                  or completely hentai.. because most of the people are just waiting for Chapter 6.5 I guess? Well for it's just that bad
Art(10/10)
One word EPIC!!!! well it's really epic and great the fighting scenes well it covers up most of the bad sides of SAO but for me Art is not the only one but still it's one of the epic anime I've ever watch.. It's great really great... the location the scenery and all.. pretty much epic
Sound(8/10)
Well not all sounds are better... the sound of Accel World is pretty much more better and Ragnarok.. so still it might work out... it can still kick ass for the sound
Character(6/10)
Well for a character I thought it was a BL coz It'll be Kirito x Klein well wahahaha... setting that aside Most of the girls falls for Kirito in one night for no apparent reasons so it's plain boring and nonsense Asuna is excempted but still I think Kirito make Asuna to eat the Rabbit's meat to make Asuna fall in love with him well that's only a speculation.. 
Enjoyment(7/10)
It's still great anime despite of it's bad sides coz I'm really wishing to play this one day.. and I think most people are watching this because of that.. SAO become more popular only because many gamers wishes to play a game like this where you're the one who is the character itself.. well making it a death game pretty much good also
Here's a comment from my friend and I kinda agree with him 
Come on People! honestly speaking SAO is not all that great! its irritating seeing people being completely all over SAO! the fight scene is all that is good in the anime but everything else is crappy. 
people only like SAO because it has great art and its an online game in which people nowadays takes interest in. people don't even give a thought about the whole story in which its just a ripped off from the anime "".hack""""
well I'm going to watch Accel World rather than SAO and I'm wanting AW to have season 2 well thank for reading :))",5
"
                Before I start this review, I want to say that most animes I like, I don't write reviews for since (for the most part) it's very obvious why people like it. For S.A.O, my experience has been different than with most animes. I went from being really uninterested and disappointed, to really enjoying it - so I thought I'd share that opinion.  
Alright, so S.A.O starts off with a really good plot line. It has elements of other-worldly anime, without being full-out magic. Basically, it has amazing potential. The issue is, that the first 9 episodes jump so much, and are all over the
                  place, which leaves the watcher feeling unsure of who to be attached to. Kirito comes off misogynistic, and arrogant - to say the least. You don't see much character development, and even more than that, once Asuna and Kirito get together you almost feel as though they've lost the only individualistic parts about them, in exchange for being in love. The thing is, once you get over that hump.. no, even DESPITE that hump, I found myself really eager to keep watching. Maybe it's the art and scenery, or just the idea of the plot in general, but it still remained enjoyable to watch. However, it did have many moments where I laughed out loud at how stupid some of the lines sounded. So far this sounds like a terrible review, but now I'll talk about why I actually enjoyed SAO, and why I would recommend it.
So, like I said, when I first started it, I was really unimpressed. I didn't understand why it was so popular, or why it had a high rating. I read reviews saying it was shit, and I thought it had no depth whatsover. It showed all this death and darkness, but none of it sunk in while watching it. I really feel like the moment that changed, for me at least, was when Asuna saved Kirito when he'd been poisoned. It was the first point where I felt like I really wanted something to happen, despite knowing he would obviously be okay (because he's the main character). I still felt, in a sense, on the edge of my seat.
Okay, now, the second plot line. ALO. I like this part better than the first season, to be completely honest. It totally has unnecessary fanservice, and covers the topics of forbidden love of incest, and rape - but honestly I really don't think that that makes it bad. I think that the character development is 100x better than the first season. You actually get to see Kirito's personality more than just watching each girl fall for him (though, they still do). However, seeing his kindness, devotion and stamina, why wouldn't everyone fall for him? You also see things he struggles with in a way that the first season didn't really emote properly. And despite Asuna becoming princess peach,  I don't agree with the people who say she's become a damsel in distress. Just because she's not in physical combat does not make her a weak character. She is constantly fighting, and doing her best emotionally. She has a lot of self respect, and is mentally really strong considering the fucked up situation she's in. If you think that her no longer having fighting scenes makes her weak or any less of a badass, I really think that's an irrelevant argument. The second season does a good job of telling how people feel where the first season was a lot of show. I also think Sugu is a really powerful female lead - and if you take out the incest bit - her feelings are definitely relatable.
All in all, I really think that the show progressed for the better towards the end. I completely see why people watch it, despite my disappointment at the start. It was definitely an enjoyable anime to watch - and although it isn't the most intellectually stimulating, it still is way better than people say it is. I wouldn't say it's the best anime in the world, but I definitely am still thinking about it after it's over... And I think that, like a good book or film, the after thought is real proof of how much you like something.",8
"
                If anime went to school SAO would be that kid who tries really hard to fit in with the cool group but ends up just being the tag along. That's all this anime is, a massive try hard. 
STORY 6:
I'm not giving this a six because it was good, I'm giving it a six because the outline of the plot is really clever but they didn't pull it off in a fashion that was appealing. The first three episodes set it up really well and if they had stuck to the skeleton of the first three eps this might have been better presented as a
                  memorable 2012 anime (for a good reason).
Not only is the story telling unlimited flawed,  the game it self ignores it's most basic rules all to help the protagonist along. The whole epic tale of beating 100 floors of monsters and bosses it totally wiped away in 13 eps all because the dribbling mess of a love story hits a fork in the road. 
ART 7:
The character designs were pretty average, it's the monsters and landscape that makes this a eye feast.
SOUND 9:
Ahh the aspect that hits the nail on the head no matter the anime. Yuki Kajiura has done it again, bypassing the shocking plot to give us magic within every battle that increases the intensity right down to the last sword swing. (Can you tell I'm biased towards her? ^^; )
CHARACTERS 4:
What characters? They's only three main characters that get more then one episode of time and most of that is spent dolling over the main character. There really isn't anything else I can say here.
ENJOYMENT 5:
This 5 comes wholeheartedly from the music for me. It was a nice watch but that fact it takes it self way to seriously flaws many of the things that could have been great about it. The romance looks like it was written by a girl who's guessing how romance works, the game pushes aside it's basic rules of the world to help the main character. It's trying way to hard to impress and that it self is a really big brick wall for development.
OVERALL 6:
It was good but not great and it most certainly wasn't the highlight of the season. Give it a go but don't go into it thinking it'll change the way you watch anime, no deep meaning, no values. 
But this is coming from a person who has watched a fair share of anime, if you're just getting into the whole anime thing it's a really good start for newbies who just want a animated thrill.",6
"
                Fan base Rant: Pretty sure the age group who rated this series a 8-10/10 MASTERPIECE are in their 12-15teens and are probably going through a phase in which they really really really want/need a girlfriend. Seen way too many kids with Kirito pictures on their profile and acting all cutesy and adaptable with the "" ^_^, its okay, I will beat this boss 4 u , etc etc"". Another reason is video games. Video games make us feel unique. But not all of us are exceptionally good at them nor get praised or rewarded from playing them. Kirito does though, hes rewarded with females, and
                  popularity(which is why you guys like him so much or want to be him). 
Plot/Story: I don't blame you. Our world is boring as balls. Who wouldn't want to stay in the digital world of monsters and dungeons and all that fun stuff. No jobs, no school, no bills, tons of people, no responsibilities, endless possibilities. 
The concept of a video game being a life or death situation amused me.  (10/10, for now)
[SPOILER TIME, MOVE THE FAWK DOWN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN THIS SERIES]
What made it drop to a 4/10 was not only a huge plot hole in the story, and the characters too (will be explained further below)
In the final episode, Kirito is fighting the main antagonist (the boss) and the boss places a spell that supposedly should have made it 10000% IMPOSSIBLE to get up (since the boss is the fricken admin and that he coded immortality , he probably coded the spell to have no other option to get up, like this 
var bind.gamespell {
percentagechancetogetup = 0%, none;
bind.strength = infinite;
}
 BUT THEN: Asuna gets up and MAGICALLY with the power of loveeee and takes the hit.
In reality, the game would crash because someone did something that was literally programmed to be impossible to do. Programming is really strict. Its like if you gave a kid two options, a banana or a strawberry and the kid magically pulls out an apple from your hand (not a magic trick) because apparently he really wanted an apple and with the power of love, he can create one from thin air.
This ruins the whole CONCEPT of video games, like what the fuck?
Imagine you have killed the strongest boss in whatever game you were playing and you get the strongest item known to man. You quickly teleport to a safe zone in which it is specifically coded to turn off all damage. BUT THEN, some guy kills you in the safe zone and takes your item.
You're probably sitting there shocked and angry and wanting to just smash everything around you because apparently some guy can kill you in a safe zone. 
Again, this ruins the whole plot and the concept/logic of programming/videogames. 
What ticked me off even more is that the creator of SAO stated ""i 4got why i did this"".... Kids, you don't spend countless hours developing a game of death just to forget it. He  could have said ""i hate the world"" etc, would have made it better. You don't spend years and years developing something so complex and then forgot why you made it.
[END OF SPOILER]
Characters:
The females are weak as hell. Asuna was literally a badass in the beginning of the series. She wore a hood, was mysterious, showed that she can use a sword extremely well. 
But then you see her turn into this weak little kid who wants to be rescued. She basically turns into your Disney princess (damsel in distress) who needs a prince charming to come by and rescue. 
Whats her name, the cousin of Kirito even has a crush on him. Why? I don't even want to ever know. They are related by blood and yet the author has to drag her into the harem party.
Answer me this, What female in this series take pride in being independent? name 3
None.
Mostly every single female falls for him apparently hes defined as a ""UNIQUE HUMAN BEING"" .
In reality, there are a shit ton of men who play games and are chill about it yet they don't get squat. Instead they are insulted for ""wasting time on games"".
OVERALL: TLDR;
-Very annoying, turns every female character into some damsel. 
-Started off great.
-Turned into a teenagers harem FANTASSYYY.
Series could have been very very good but it flopped. Enjoyment wise as a gamer, it reminded me of Runescape, very nostalgic. I can see why people like this series and I have nothing against them but... there are most likely better series that have a similar plot",4

                Sword Art Online: This is one of the most anticipated animes out there, and, as many of your friends might have told you if you havent watched this yet, is ""AMAZING   10/10 BEST SHOW EVER"". Well this anime is quite mainstream for a reason: like many shonen anime, SAO promises many enjoyable moments for quite a large amount of viewers, and promises (with emphasis) on what may be a great story line. However, I would be lying if I had told you I have not heard the story of people getting stuck in a video game. So here is an honest review of
                  the show Sword Art Online.
Story:    6/10
             The show's story is one that has been told over and over again to me, and is very unoriginal in my opinion. However, due to the fact that not many pieces of art have portrayed the idea of how difficult it may be to survive in a virtual realm, I have decided not to instantly drop this show. Progressing in the show, the story massively drops and does not promise much more. I was honestly thinking of dropping after the first 14 episodes, as the rest just felt milked straight from the cow's utter, but managed to go through to the end. Story was fair, but could have been better.
Also, a more interesting part of the plot, Akihiko's reason for creating such a workd was NEVER REVEALED. That was truly disappointing.
Art:   9/10
            What can I say? Just like Anohana, this show portrays the potential of how much better many animes can be drawn. Beautiful art.
Sound 7/10
                           Now dont get me wrong here, alot of the show's music was extremely well done; however, the show does not promise much memorable music, and require visualization to be listened to which really doesn't do it for me. What I mean is that the music is only something I would listen to while watching the show, and I do not plan on downloading any mp3's off of it or anything like that.
Character 3/10
                Some of the characters in this show are just god awful, and have no reason to be in the story's plot whatsoever. The main character, Kirito, is a cool antisocial guy, yet happens to be followed around by a bunch of girls who just instantly fall inlove with him for no reason whatsoever. I mean, the guy is portrayed as a complete loser in his real life. Why on earth would amazingly hot women (which do not exist in real mmo's) just happen to fall inlove with this antisocial kid who technically couldn't even hold up a conversation. Also, Asuna, who is primarily portrayed as a powerful lone woman who depends on nobody but herself, magically changes into princess peach, who requires to be saved by a man everytime. the 5/10 comes not because I didn't enjoy watching these characters, but it obviously shows that the developers sided with fan service. Theres forced love all over the place and major personality changes over the course of 5 minutes. Obviously done in their mastermind plan of milking the show. (think about it if fanservice didnt exist in this show the 2nd season would not have been milked out in the first place).   AND FINALLY, Yui...What? She became a main character? O.k..... she was literally born out of a filler episode.
Enjoyment 7/10
Besides all the negativity towards this show, Sword Art Online kept me on my seat at some points. The great fighting scenes, the hope Kirito brings to Asuna, the great art, FLYING IN SEASON 2, the mastermind Akihiko. Etc.
On a side note, one thing that still doesnt make sense to me till this day is how did Akihiko even manage to trap 10,000 people in the first place? I mean did they all happen to log on at the same time? Did some get trapped before others logged in until everyone was trapped? Maybe, but if thats the case, how come the people who died when they realised they were trapped werent reported to the news BEFORE the rest put on their nerve gears? What is that?",6
"
                SAO's plot can be summarized as the journey of the main character towards finishing a game in which the players are trapped into. The story may sound simple (and the animation is not the best out there), but the way it's presented is what keeps me tuned in every week. 
Being a previous gamer, I personally like and enjoy how various MMORPG scenarios were presented and are put into someone's perspective. And along with those, I get to see characters grow and develop into better players and people. The only thing that's worrying me right now is the tendency of the story to stray away
                  fr the MMORPG storyline and eventually become the typical love story/any anime story that is set in a virtual world. There were episodes that I felt were too focused on building relationships rather than walking through the game itself. But then again, it gives me a feeling of excitement, whenever the story goes back to gaming coming from a relationship side plot. 
At this point, the anime has a huge potential to become awesome because there are still several areas of gaming that could be showcased. And as I said, the story isn't that bad so if the writers will be able to make the perfect mix of both, we could have the anime of the year right here.",9
"
                I've heard about SAO from many, many people. I hear that it was very mediocre, but I realized lots of people have also praised SAO for it being a masterpiece, so I decided to give it a shot, and it was definitely anything but a masterpiece.
From what I've witnessed over twenty-five episodes, was the concept of an MMORPG being the main setting for an animation. That was the first thing I piqued my interest, and brought me in to watching this show. 
Now, we'll start off with the positives, and there really isn't much to be positive about. I thought SAO, while lacking in many
                  aspects, was highly enjoyable to watch. While I know where it was lacking, it seemed quite entertaining.
The music was also very well in setting up every scene in SAO. I thought that was the strongest point of this show. Every boss fight, every depressing scene, was planted very nicely because of this.
The art was, well, it wasn't anything special. It was nice, but it was what we've become accustomed to seeing from A-1 Pictures, time and time again. Still, it was very good.
----------------------
Now lets jump into the negatives, and those major two points would easily be the story, and the characters. 
Lets start with the story. Other than the first few episodes, SAO did a pretty poor job executing the story-line properly. Time-skips, and subplots, that's pretty much all this was up to episode 14. It was really hard to really grasp the situation they were in at all because of this. What I thought was going to be the main story, was the MC and other characters trying to make a determined effort to escape SAO, surely didn't happen for the majority. Instead, all we got to see was characters make a one-episode stint, and then be forgotten again. It started to feel more episodic than actually having anything story-wise.
All this leading up to episode 14, where, in my eyes, I thought SAO should've ended. Instead, they somehow pull horseshoes out of their a** like it's an everyday thing, and SAO continues onwards into the second arc. I'll explain more in my character reviews about this segment.
After episode 14, this whole thing goes to real crap. I had no real connection to the story-line whatsoever, because at this point, all it was doing was dragging it out to appeal to the fans. Everything from this point was so obviously predictable (Well, the whole story was, lets be honest), especially the sister-brother thing, which is probably the epitome of cliche of late. To top it all off, the ending was almost a mirror image of episode 14, and at this point, I just didn't care.
CHARACTERS. I'm going to try to put this nicely. Such bland, stale, unbeatable characters heading SAO. 
Kirito you could hardly feel for, because everything he did was so utterly predictable. I'd be surprised if you couldn't guess what was going to happen with him. I don't know if they were trying build and develop character with the overabundance of subplots, but they sure did a terrible job of doing anything of the sort if that was their plan. All of the scenes where Kirito was grasping for straws didn't have any emotion stringed with them, because at this point, we all knew what was going to happen, and the story did a great job of making that unfortunately obvious.
Asuna. Perfect wife material I guess? Pretty much about it though. She spent half her time cooking for Kirito, which, I found absolutely hilarious. She, while better than Kirito, was still extremely bland. We all knew what was going to happen with these two after the second episode. She apparently was always there to save the day. The interaction and development between these two MC's was so cliche it hurt. 
And then, once they reached episode 14, I personally thought this should've been it for them. If they expected to continue on SAO for 25 episodes, they should've split it into a smaller one-cour, two seasons, or at the very least, had a different character take the front (Perhaps Sugu, because she was an MC in the 2nd arc). Instead, these characters defy all odds and are simply unbeatable. From this point moving forward, I had no emotional attachment to the characters, that of course being if there was any to begin with, and I was simply wondering when it'd be over, because I'd already guessed what was going to happen.
Now, this part will be a bit *SPOILERY*, so bare caution while proceeding for this next paragraph. 
Sugu (Or Leafa), is your typical sister. I didn't think they'd do this, I actually didn't think they would, so this was a massive surprise for me. They actually had the ""I'm not your actual sister so I love you onii-chan!"" gag. I was laughing. I don't know what else to say about this. It was just, wow. For SAO, which seemed more directed towards being so kid-like of an anime, I couldn't believe they added incest love to the story.
*END SPOILER*
As for the rest of the cast. Other than the first guild, along with Sachi. They all didn't really serve any importance to the story in terms of character development, or adding to the story in general. Most of them, as I said earlier, had one-episode stints, and then disappeared for the remainder of SAO.
Overall, given all the negatives I've had to deal with in SAO, I'm giving it a 5/10. I don't give anything less than a 5/10 if I actually enjoyed watching it throughout, but due to the major deficiencies in the story and the characters, it cannot get anything more than a 5. 
If you want to watch bland characters, and a jumbled up mess of a story, along with you being able to predict every single thing along the way, then SAO might just be your ""masterpiece"".",5

                Setting: Player is trapped inside a Virtual reality MMORPG, from the moment I saw first note on this anime I knew That for 100% I will watch it. Yet normally try to wait for anime to end because I like to watch it fully and wait for it to end, But here I couldn't because I am a gamer who is still playing WOW and started it half when european servers came up.
The hole concept of VR was in my interest for a long time, and I readed about it way before this anime was known to me. 
So when I saw combination of three
                  things that I like I couldn't not watch it, But I tried, I was able to start it when 7 episodes were out already. So:
The first episode was second best ever (for me (first place DN) first episode that I have seen. After all it combined my intrest, graphic is great as anime in 2012 should have been, and the story that was shown was really serious, and could go in many dirrections, you had no clue what awaits you in next episode.
As I watched the rest I liked how it went all characters fit story and protagonist isn't some flawless here and he isn't useless as it happens a lot, and the things he do fit his personality.
I won't mention about story but just few fellings of mine about them
First already described, Second I really liked the end of it as he became beater.
3-7 introduce characters, and have purpose to slow down the action. (Note: they are actually side stories in novel), and now we have episode 8 (which is start of actuall story that was in first novel)
As you can guess I have already readed novel, I did it after I watched 7 episodes, actually I already readed 7 volumes in 5 days (average 270-330 page each, (I have lot of time= holidays) so I can say the story has a potential to have 10 from me (look at my list to see how many titles have it),also if they do it correctly I a sure you that if you can cry and smile at the same time because of anime this will bring tears and smile at the end, also I hope there will be more seasons which will show rest off volumes which are great as well.
 (note: novels are great they discribe more, have more content, and if you have good imagination you will have great fell from this, if you readed books you know what I mean, another note: the ones that were asked to read by teachers mostly didn't felt to your taste and were uninteresting, should I said boring. But books are great and if you have time read them, something like this title should suit your taste as you like anime)
first review although if you like it check out my anime list as it has short notes about every anime I watched. Also I don't think that review should be done as this is still ongoing but I liked it so much that I wanted to do one even if only for my pleasure of writing down about things I like",9

Studio: A1-pictures (Fairy Tail, Blue exorcist, Magi the labyrinth of magic)
Note: there is 10 Light Novels of this series, Sword Art Online is originally a Light Novel series written by Reki Kawahara.
So i know that there has been a lot of mixed reviews of this anime, but don't let that stop you! this anime is one of the best out there! Story:
The story is really deep and makes you more connected to the characters. The only problem i have with the story is how they try to put all the side story's from the second light novel into a specific order.
Art:
The art in this anime is really well done and you can see at once that they has really made this a top priority!
Sound:
The voice acting in the anime is perfect the voices really suites perfect, the music in the background makes the scenes really exciting!
Characters:
The characters in Sword Art Online is really easy to feel connected to, they show great emotions and love, you will instantly notice which characters you like and which characters you can not stand.
Enjoyment
I really do enjoy this Anime, a lot of people says it is not as good as the light novel, but i have read the light novels and i feel that you should give them both a shot!
Overall
If you want an Anime with a lot of action, emotions, excitement this is the Anime for you",10
"
                Yes, this is a hyped anime. But it deserves the hype it gets. It's absolutely amazing. Ok, so I am a SAO fangirl and yes, there were some flaws, but doesn't every anime have them? If you're thinking about it, don't second guess yourself. I heard about the hype, and I, too was like how good can it actually be? Watch the first episode, and you'll be hooked.
The idea of being in a virtual world where if you died, you died in the real world was brilliant. I love MMORPGS, and when watching this anime, I felt like they gave the gaming world justice. The
                  story line was rushed to me, though. You have 100 floors, so use all of them! Also, every boss fight, only took a couple of minutes. They were still badass though, but I felt like they could have been longer. Also, each episode was like its own plot line which was fun, but it made it feel even more rushed. But then again, that's better than just dragging on till the point where you just give up on the anime.
The art was beautiful and I loved how each floor was it's own landscape. I really wished they went more in detail, but I won't argue. The anime is refreshing and everyone gets a total makeover in the second arc. ;) But, I didn't like the looks in ALO compared to SAO, in SAO, Kirito, the main character, looked cooler. 
The voice actors were really great. I personally fell in love with Kirito's voice, and Asuna's wasn't annoying like how some characters are. The sound in the fights were good, too. Even though, the background/battle music wasn't my favorite, it was still good.
The bonds (episode name hehe) between everyone were so sweet, and I was totally rooting for the main couple. And you get to see how Kirito changes. I liked every character individually, but they weren't the most unique. Kirito, being the main character, has everything come so easy for him. But this is an anime, and I love Kirito, so it's ok. 
Overall, unique story with beautiful art. I finished the anime in 2 days, watching 15 episodes today, the anime will not bore you.",10

                Once upon a time something happened... and if it had not happened, it would not be told - so I guess at least!
I myself am a huge fan of swords and in the past I was able getting some knowledge at how to use it properly! Well then... as I heard there was an anime airing, called Sword Art Online, I thought this might suit perfectly... to me!
What a mistake!
And they call this mistake (I can't wonder enough) one of the best Animes that has been released! I mean... seriously?!?!
Allow me, to ask; why?
There are a plenty of characters I don't like, the storyline is
                  full of... nothing?... ridiculous stuff which are getting even stranger by every Episode you're actually (and seriously) watching... I mean, they are like prisoners... just in a game... they want to escape - BUT, and this is so ridiculous that I can't even believe it anymore, some of them are getting married and thinking about children and a peaceful house/household! BUT, just to remind us every single Episode: we're still prisoners; they say something like... Ou, in the real world it's like this... 
*Facepalm*??
That's why seeing a bunch of character behave like everything is normal is so extremly ridiculous and strange... I can't even think of a better word! 
What a bullsh*t!!
But I made it - I got through the entire anime, 25 episodes! However, around Episode 13/14 SAO stopps - just to be able introducing ""Alfheim Online""! (I guess this was made just to please the fanboys and Girls - at least I do hope so!!) And just to Keep the attention, Asuna serves as a Sextoy... ok...
The Score and the Animation are quite alright - nothing more to say!
So personally speaking; SAO is one of these most overrated series of the past years with, however, very very little that makes it worth a good watch!",2
"
                Sword Art Online (SAO) is an anime that needs to be in your watch/plan to watch list!
I was compelled by this anime because of my love for games and the fact that I have always wanted or rather dreamed of being in a virtual world. This isn't just a regular game though, and has more life like qualities. For example, being killed in the game means you actually die in the real world. This to me makes the anime more interesting, the fact that the people who have joined the game must fight for their life and train to their best abilities or they will
                  die! I also enjoyed how the drama was presented and almost unpredictable to me, making me think more about how the anime will continue and end.",10
"
                To me SAO is the show that could've been. I've never seen more promise in a shown, thrown to waste in a brief 25 episodes. 
1. Story: 10
Wait before you guys that have looked at my rating for the show attack me in unpleasant ways let me explain. The real reason SAO isn't a 10 overall is the progression of the story (see #2). SAO takes place in a video game world with a potentially complex storyline. The story itself is actually not half bad. There are very few stereotypical aspects in the anime besides the simple fact that it was made in 2011-2012 which
                  forces it to have some lame, poorly developed romance, tryhard male protagonist, pseudo incest, and unnecessary fan service, but that's just the industry now (don't quote me on that). The idea of putting an anime in a medieval game (well sometimes medieval) world is absolute genius and I commend the authors for it.
2. Progression of Story: 0
The problem with this show is its progressions are forced. Jumping from level 70-something to game complete was a mistake, a major mistake. My rating at the time went from a 10 to a 4 although I should've seen it coming when the creators announced how many episodes the series was going to be. This anime is a 200+ episode anime. I am so serious, each and every floor they were on should have had a mini story. They jump 20+ floors in some episodes. Now I've personally never read the novels or mangas or w/e else but more than likely the progressions are similar. Just think about it though the period inwhich they were taking a break from trying to complete the game should have been 25+ episodes. Could you imagine the kind of character development that could have occurred within that time frame? How Kirito and Asuna could have developed a deeper relationship? And finally the part where they started playing that new game should have been a second season all together and also should have shed some more light on all the characters from the original game. Like forreal (real talk for a second) how did Kirito just so happen to find that bartender guy outside of the game? And how did everyone just so happen to like within a apparent 10 mile radius of him? This kind of stuff can be explained it's just that the series lacked the episodes to do so. I can't even give this a 1.
3. Art: 8
The art in respect to characters is very basic and very stereotypical (fitting the 2012 mold perfectly). The real beauty in this show comes from the game and the combat and interfaces within the game. The battle scenes were breath taking, but usually occurred a bit too often (and early) for my liking. The art overall was an 8.
4. Music: 6
The music was very average and sometimes contradicted the game feel the anime was initially giving off. The battle music was basic at best and didn't do much to enhance the scene that much. The music used elsewhere neither wowed me or made me say ""What the hell?"" The intros were what I expect from anime now. Overall the music gets an average 6 from me. 
5. Characters: 1
Just eww? These characters completely lacked development, some guy would just become the bad guy or Kirito and Asuna just fall in love or some error with no basis occurs that results in some supporting character (that become very irritating after like 2 episodes of her *couch* Yui *cough*) appears out of nowhere. Although I was very harsh just then I would like to say the majority of this problem comes from how few episodes there were and how quickly the story had to progress. But to me Kirito seems like he's some annoying gamers whose got his boxers on too tight and his corduroys to high. He seems to high and mighty and hasn't had much to humble him throughout the series resulting in a bland and predictable character. Asuna. Who the fudge is she? Like what the hell, the amount of light shed on her is a little bit better after they ""beat"" the first game but in reality she wasn't given time to develop and therefore just did stuff (I'm so serious) that characters in anime with this much potential don't do. And there's his obnoxious sister too. Just had to do that didn't you? Could've been anyone else. School friend, IRL girlfriend, even a muthalovin childhood friend. But noooooo you had to go with the BROCON. Das dead (that's all I have to say). 
Basically that's the jist of it. A show with so much potential just thrown away.",4
"
                This series is probably one of the most highly anticipated series of 2012, and for a good reason. Originally written as a Light Novel which has won many acclaims, it is definite a series worth a look.
Sword Art Online is a MMORPG/Adventure series about a futuristic virtual reality MMO turned into a death game by the game's mysterious creator. The series focuses on the main characters/players Kirito and Asuna as they fight through and experience the new virtual world with the rest of the trapped players in the game.
Story: 8/10
Oddly enough, this move of moving into the LN's side stories first (SS) may or may
                  not be a miss on fellow LN readers. This is due to the SS order which originally supposes the reader to have read the main series beforehand. However, the script writers have integrated the SS well to serve as the main plot's prequel, so that's understandable. 
So for anyone who didn't read the LN, do not worry; you didn't miss a thing. As for the re-ordering of the SS first strategy, I personally didn't like the progression due to me reading the LN first. Hence 8/10.
Art: 8/10
The art style featured in SAO definitely has it's quirks; the fight scenes are smooth and the usage of color is done tastefully; giving the audience a sense of the danger of the unknown faced by the SAO players. 
I also find myself enjoying the little details like the environment and backgrounds of SAO. The player's user interface is also a unique feature and is well thought out. The destruction animation of shattering glass gives a dramatic effect to the given scenarios.
The character designs...I think it is really up to the viewer's taste. They feel angular and fixated at times.
Characters: 6/10
Unfortunately here, compared to the LN is where the anime adaptation falls on it's face. Often I find myself feeling that the Kirito here feels noticeably different compared to the Kirito in the LN. The same can be said of Asuna. Since this is supposed to be an adaption of the LN as the plot and characters haven't changed; I can't help but feel the animators couldn't capture the magic of the original LN personalities.
Enjoyment: 8/10
Despite the nitpicks above; I do find myself drawn into the series; often wishing it updated faster than updating each Friday. It doesn't quite match the original time and excitement I spent on the LN, but that's like saying a roller coaster isn't as exciting as bungee jumping.
Overall: 8/10
A great series that magically draws you in to the world of SAO; even moreso for the fellow LN readers. A series you should definitely give a shot at. The beginning does come off slow; but do remember it is 24 episodes long and as of me writing this, we're only 1/2 way through.
Given the plot progression and assumption it will continue following the LN's plot; you're going to see some impressive things.
Also this concludes my first ever review on MyAnimeList. Sorry if the quality is sub-par.

                (This may contain minor spoilers pertaining to where the story's future will be)
As of the moment of this review, the show runs up into Episode 20 out of 25, and I can say that, in my personal opinion, the show is definitely not shit.
I'd like to first address the many problems that seem to be the focus of the show's hateful attention, such as character development, story progression, and the fact that most of the SAO arc was explained in only the first two episodes.
To begin with, I'm going to take a wild throw at this and assume the producing company wasn't given a Naruto-sized
                  budget for this project. What does this mean? The Animation may take a hit (Some people like to point out the choppy fighting), Story Progression will be slow/nonexistent, important facts will be left out entirely. Trying to fit such an extensive series into 25 episodes, whilst addressing every necessary detail would be rather impossible, and I'm sure that the first season (These 25 episodes) focus on both SAO and Alfheim to let the audience get a better idea of the setting. This isn't .Hack, the series does not focus on one set MMO. Spend as much time trying to explain SAO's mechanics as you'd like, once you reach the Alfheim arc, everything you spent all that time learning is practically tossed out the window.
The first 12 episodes felt very rushed, could it be possible that they're trying to introduce each character now so you're not left wondering who they are in the later episodes? Assuming there will be a second season, many of the characters that were shown only once, then dropped from existence will be returning, as they do in the light novel. The series has yet to finish, so final judgement based on half of the story should never be passed.
The main character tends to have an advantage in almost every scenario, which can be seen as a plus on his side. He's not the generic cliche perverted or super-dense protagonist, and his thought process is unorthodox, this makes him more mysterious and wise in an awkward way. The female protagonist is also far from the generic, as she is not completely useless and actually assists the main character in more ways than one, and is far from the ""Damsel in Distress"" trope, managing to get herself out of tight situations when the main character isn't around to save her. She doesn't lean on him to do everything for her, and even saves his life. I don't remember Bella Swan beat the ever living hell out of the Vulturi, almost sacrificing her social position to save Edward.
I'll also think about how the future of this story may go. Some may thing it's a minus because it doesn't follow the original story to the dot, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. Full Metal Alchemist, for one example, went on its own merry way and became popular as a show separate from the original story. It became an even more massive hit when it did, though. What I'm saying is is that because a lot of shows that take their own path fail miserably, it doesn't mean that this one will too. Call me an Optimist if you will, it can get better if you give it a chance.
The art was rather nice, as the character outfits fit a broad range of Fantasy backgrounds. One character has Samurai armor, another one Crusader-like armor, some with demonic knight armor. It's not generalized and the artist delves into apparel with different geographic history. The backgrounds are well-made, and some of the monsters are pretty neat.
As for Sound, it had a soundtrack amongst the better anime (Yuki Kajiura FTW) but the openings and endings weren't the best picks. Some of the sound effects are definitely recycled, but it feels very much more like a video game with some of the player abilities.
All in all, it's a nice break from shoujo romances or psychological thrillers. It'd be better if they included most of the needed detail, but what they have is acceptable for what they're trying to pull. Hopes to a remake or an expanded OVA.",8
"
                I do not understand where all the hate comes from for this show. I am not even a hardcore fan of the series but the first season is quite literally dope.
Story: 7
Alright, the story is pretty generic. Nothing amazing, nothing too awful. However, it is done well and above average. The way the plot moves and the pace are definitely pretty great. I wouldn't have touched SAO if this season was any longer than what it is now.
People gripe about how the story is not amazing, not different, and therefore devalue the story.  I watched it, I wasn't amazed and I didn't jumped out
                  of my chair but I wasn't angry, there was nothing to be angry about! The world is set in a game that isn't bounded by real life, expect  OP plot devices.
Art: 10
You either like it or you don't. It is pretty superb for a 2012 Anime.
Sound: 8
Once again you either like it or you don't. Expect the usual awesome OP and ED songs and decent music during the episodes. 
Characters: 6
I happen to like what was offered from the characters in SAO however I did notice that a lot of them were pretty unrealistic. I don't mind lack of realism because of the environment set by the show. 
Kirito: I would say his personality is your typical self sacrificing, emotional, and world saving kind of guy. Yeah, it can get kind of cringy or a little overboard but I believe SAO doesn't kill you with it. 
Asuna: Once again the typical significant other to the main character. Loves him dearly, connects with him, cares for him, and all that lovey dovey stuff. Has a strong and confident side but is overshadowed later in the series by the love.
Enjoyment: 8
I enjoyed the show because it had the right amount of romance and action. I don't believe the show tried to be the AMAZING but I do believe it hit the right spot when determining the amount of romance and action the viewers were given. I never felt like there wasn't enough of something when watching. Picture yourself having a nice fulfilling meal when watching SAO.
Overall: 8
Don't get sucked into the crazy hype because it might disappoint you. Make sure you know what you want before you watch the series. If you want some generation breaking Anime, SAO isn't the one. If you want something solid, something polished, then the first season of SAO is great.
You can't demand perfection, you have to let it flow naturally to you and that's how I believe people should watch this show. Just absorb it, don't go looking for every little thing.",8
"
                Sword Art online is a great anime in terms of concept and visuals but falls flat when it comes to unique characters or plot lines.  The exciting concept and extremely fine animation were enough to make me give it a chance but after meeting the bland main protagonist who walks around void of believable emotion and any motivation, I can't say it's well written.  All female characters are portrayed as weak and in need of being saved and Kirito is the only one who can get the job done despite there being no actual reason for why he is the only one capable.
                   He is often in position of unique edges such as his ""dual wielding"" but the anime fails to explain why he is the only one to get such a boost!  The show makes Kirito stronger because the writers did not have a better way around it.  They made a static character that doesn't grow and a story that is as cookie cutter as Shadow the Hedgehog- wait...  I mean Kirito.  
What this Anime does have going for it is how easy it is to watch.  The characters and plot are simple to follow and honestly, you probably already know the characters if you've seen another anime or movie in your entire life.  As I joked above, if you want to know what Kirito is going to do, just imagine what Shadow the hedgehog would do- it's generally the same thing.  It's also beautiful to look at.  The animators and visual devs went all out and made this one of the best animes I've ever seen.  
In all, I don't think this is a good anime because I cannot get past my opinion of the characters and simplistic plot however it isn't without redemption.  Of course, that's just my opinion and I know lots of people who see something I don't within this plot.  All I can say is, as a writer myself, this anime feels very generic and poorly supported.",4
"
                side note: ah my english is actually bad so...
so alllll over youtube I kept seeing and hearing about that amazing show SAO. and that provoked my interest. like WOW an anime about mmorpg (that I love to play so much) thats something coool, unique, amazing I thought. 
I must seeee that piece of art I thought.
and so after getting it one beautiful night I started to watch it. and that was AMAZING! amazing! it was about that antisocial bad ass protaginist Kirito who is trapped in vrmmorpg with bunch of other players and death in game = death IRL. and so they having those bad
                  ass boss battles to complete a game in order to go back to normal life. some of them actually dying so this is serious show, not some regular harem bullshit with stereotypical protagonist! noooo this protagonist is beater, hes a beta tester and hes really strong, bad ass and dont want to asociate with anybody else. he's a solo player! WOW, just wow! and all this beautiful stunning animation oh! just look at this! I gonna have some nice anime night watch here!
and the 2nd ep ends...........
and I m all like WTF? like next episodes dont have any boss battles anymore (they promosed 100 boss battles, but oh well I guess they will show them in later episodes) and every episode is about the certain girl who is in trouble and.. kirito helping her (where did I seen it already?). so wtf? its not a regular harem show... right?? and kirito... uh.. why don't he fight some boss? you know there's a lot of bosses out there.. so why would he waste his precious time with those noob girls? he's a solo player. he dont like to asociate with peoples? hes a badass right? right?
so yeah.. after those completely meaningless episodes with various girls we already know that kirito is actually just a regular harem character with no charisma. he just a good boy who will never leave a girl in trouble. not even a girl, he must save the world. save everybody. hes the chosen one! holy shit are you serious? sao? you fucking kidding me?? another one? another touma from index? another stupid harem character? another good boy? another savior? oh for fuck sake... but hes still considered a solo player somehow... because he never join any guilds (except those two exclusive times).
oh and lets not forget that hes insanely overpowered. so thats how you kill any interest, any intrigue about character! good job sao, good job...
so in later episodes we somehow JUST SKIP a fucking year and go to another meaningless pointless detective story about how player died in save zone. so instead of boss battle (suposed to be 100 of them) you throwing this shit in my face? oh sao why you so mean? so yeah the great detective kirito solved a mysterious detective one (or two, I dont remember) episode story. hes so great. and that mysterious detective one episode story was so worth of watching...
later we still have no boss battles but we have some regular bad ass love story about regular harem character kirito falling in love with regular anime tsundere asuna. wow. and I really thought this anime gonna be all about adventures, cruel fights, deaths and hardships that characters must overcome in that deadly world. what a stupid of me! how dare I excpect something like this?! instead we have this assuna and kirito banal love story. painfully simple (in bad way), banal love story. they met each other, they fell in love, they married other day, they bought a house and we have this most boring plot in entire anime that lasts for several episodes. and so they just living together... and one day they found that little girl in the forest who is most annoying character in this damn show. turned out that this anoying little girl is somehow kiritos and asunas daughter... can it be more stupid than this? sure it can! later that annoying stupid little girl turned out to be some.. uh.. program banned from system... and even later that anoying stupid brat little girl shaped program turns into accesory so she wont annoy us anymore.. and so assuna and kirito lost their lovely daughter who they became so attached to during those few boring episodes. so cruel! so stupid! are you kidding me sao? gods..
now hey its not like sao is so bad just because it includes few episodes of romance. I like romance. I love romance. problem is that this romance is really worth 3/10. its bad. bad shity romance. so boring, no drama in it. and that daughter.. for fuck sake romances is about MAKING fucking daughters not about already having one.. out of nowhere.
so later we just skip some more years and jumping to final events. BOSS FIGHT again!! yay! this one will be really hard, some bad ass boss out there. well most of boss battles was boring so they just skipped them (they showed only 3 of them out of 100 through entire show) but this one is worth showing so this will be really bad ass. and it was. another amazing boss battle! many non important loosers (who supposed to be great soldiers knowing fact they were in top guild) died from single hit in that cruel battle but ofcourse our main superhero kirito killed the boss because he is the greatest, strongest, most powerful and most amazing protagonist. but due to his incredibly high detection skill the great detective kirito somehow managed to detect the fact that his guild leader is actually a GM whos trapped players in this virtual game world. and so they skipped all those 25 bosses that left (they wouldn't show them anyway..) and started to fight against the last boss, a gm, game creator kayaba. what a drama omg! whos gonna fight this overpowered gm? ofcourse its kirito! cause hes the only one!! and all others who is not important to have a screen time is paralyzed so it will be amazing duel. and so that paralyze is somehow defeated by asunas willpower. she became a meat shield for her kirito and here we see her increadibly dramatic last words. and she died, we will never see her again.. except few minutes later in the same episode. somehow she's not dead!! wha.. how? nobody knows! but sao need her alive so she could be locked in... a birds cage... and molested by psycho who is even worse villain of the show and ofcourse so kirito could save her. so we have ANOTHER princess in a cage type of story! .... thats how even bigger disaster Alfheim online begins.......
now I will stop here.. I m not writing textwall about 2nd half just the fact that its even worse than first half. you can't actually die there (so whats the point?), kirito is all about saving asuna from birds cage, story becomes boring, everything goes bad, I m thinking of quiting this shit halfway and can't believe what shit it turns into after those promising first 2 episodes. this show in not just bad illogical bullshit. its fucking disaster. 3/10. fuck this shit. seriously this is most disapointing fucked up anime in entire history. 
yet it have shitload of tasteless fans who can't see how bad it is and praising it for something thats beyond me. and ofcourse they will keep saying that I m just a troll, they will not accept reallity even after all those facts that I thrown to their faces in this ""review"" they will intentionally stay blind and wont accept reality.
this shit even touches some of my favorite incest topic. and this is one of worse attempts I've seen. like kiritos sister is not really a sister but just a cousin, so they have this most regular fucked up excuse that kills the topic itself. also she is just a small part of his harem and their story is not escalated enough to be worth anything.
so yea sao is that bad. really weak....",1
"
                When I express my opinion, do not leave hateful comments on my blog.
One of my friend recommended me to watch this anime. I was so astonished by the art and animation especially for the music which each deserves a 7. It was based on an online MMORPG game.
The fun part was that the players have to go through many levels in order to accomplish the game. In fact, there is a 100 levels to accomplish.  But then, the fun part was ruined by Kirito and Asuna's relationship. However, I don't mind romance because it is found in most anime nowadays.
Kirito: Badass, throughout the anime
                  but anti-social. He also attracts some women in this game.
Asuna: Badass at first, tsundere but her character degraded to a crybaby and a weakling, in the second half she became a damsel in distress.
It is so sad to see that there is no character development and the second half of this anime was actually the biggest vice. Suguha, Kirito's cousin was introduced and she gets along well with Kirito. Suguha's character online is Leafa. It looks like they are trying to have a love triangle but it was unnecessary because Kirito will end up with Asuna. 
1st arc - If you die in this game, you die in real life. There is no escape from this game.
2nd arc - You can log out any time, but if you die you have to reset the game. 
I am so sick and tired of seeing women in most animes become damsel in distress like Fushigi Yuugi, Ragnarok, Zero no Tsukaima, Chaos Head, Vampire knight, etc... I cannot name a lot. Anyway, I am so sad to see that such good potential wasted in this anime.
Do not recommend me any anime which involves damsel in distress because I will not give a good rating as this cliches is so frequently used in action anime. If I want to watch action anime, I'd rather watch Yozakura Quartet.
Please respect my opinion. Thank you so much.",3

                [Edited to Episode 10 standing]
Sub group used: UTWoots
This review is ongoing until SAO ends. Current episodes reviewed: 10. 
Conclusion: Early - Near expected halfway point. 
Early note to viewers: This review is long, and until the whole series is complete, it will remain without a general summary.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have not read the light novel or any original material on SAO, but I don't think it's required since this review is after all an ""anime review"", not a SAO analysis as a whole. Also, I understand SAO is not particularly seinen material. However, I will be writing this review from the perspective of a viewer and reader of generally more serious and developed series. I understand some of us like watching anime simply for enjoyment factors, however, my review is addressed to a particular crowd in some aspects. Do know, my review is mostly an analysis of every episode ongoing; meaning, each episode or bundle of episodes will receive its own critique. I will stop doing this method until *parts* of the anime change or move on. I know that while that is both tedious and unorthodox to my dear readers, I will never reveal too much per episode, nor will I go too into detail on what the episode is about. I simply do this, so you may have an idea as to where this anime is going from an analytically intensive view. I'm sorry if you find what I say offensive to your interests at times, but to some degree - I'm not sorry, I am objective. I know, anime is not a research paper or study for us to have to ""work"" around, but I prefer handing you all information as a review should do, instead of simply stating whether this anime was ""good"" or ""bad"".
NOTE: Guys, if you want to discuss why you agree (or much more wanted: disagree) with me, I am always up for a quick little talk about SAO on the basis of my review. Obviously, this is a user review, available for everyone to submit - don't take me as someone trying to destroy the ""hypes"" of a season out of spite, take me as an objective viewer who is fairly critical to certain aspects of an anime. I enjoy dissecting a work, and if you want to throw in a conversation with me along the way - more than welcomed to. 
-----------------------------------------------
1) Initial Reception
I can only honestly say, I was only somewhat interested at the release of SAO. My anticipations were non-existent, since it was material I haven't touched before in the past; and I could only make a few guesses at where the anime would go in terms of general direction. SAO on the surface, consisted of a plot that revolved around a collection of players stuck in a virtual reality world that took the form of an MMORPG. That concept, seen before in other series (serious or spoofs), made me wonder how this anime in 2012 would take on the concept of reality gaming in regards to what we know as an internet culture. The first episode started, and by the time it finished, I was in indecision whether if it was a good episode or not. Sure, I enjoyed the fact that the first episode took on the direction of making a distinguished line between reality and a virtual reality; but also making a broad connection between the two. The concept has been explored before by books such as ""Cyberia"", where author Douglas Rushkoff has a hard time determining one's existence in a cyber syncing world. So overall from the start, I thought this anime would have a strong plot, a few catharsis moments in terms of human existence, and that the characters that would carry out this message in a memorable way. I can only say, that that was a premature wish.
2) A little more into SAO, episodes 2-4
So episode 2 was a sort of an early climatic moment - the clearing of the first stage. You get to meet a few more players in this world, along with the attitude of the main character in regards to his perception of this world. I wasn't impressed at how this episode rolled out (a few odd presentations of events, some weak scenes and dialogue), but a couple redeeming factors such as the excitement of the 'start' of the true adventure ahead and the fight scene made me a tad more excited for this series. Yes, everything needs a winding start to get momentum, so I let my concerns slide. Overall, I wasn't particularly disappointed at this episode.
But, then episode 3 and 4 came out. Episode 3 attempted to be a further look at connections between player to player; or really, person to person. It also explores a little on the past events that gives the main character the drive and reason to continue. But, the presentation was not very strong. In fact, I can only say that the attempt (because it was only an attempt) to garner empathy and sympathy from the viewers in a short 20 minute segment on the events that happened in this episode was clearly a bad choice. I remember sitting and watching the episode finishing, and thinking ""was I supposed to be sad for the new people who I had only briefly met?"" Look, I understand the storyboard may want to get by certain things faster, and work more on major plot moments - but don't try and lead your audience around on a rickety emotional roller-coaster. For a little clarity for what I'm referring to, my gentle audience - a character (along with a few other not worth mentioning) dies in the episode. This character has questions regarding her mortality, why she is here in the first place and subject to this situation (a fair question); and fluctuates around giving up, and believing she can make it. The main character basically fails to protect this person despite repeatedly promising he would protect said player, but is later assured that it was not his fault by a sort of early suicide letter (I don't want to call the message a suicide letter; let's just say, the writer of it knew that one day they'd probably die). In short, episode 3 went by too fast and expected too many things from its viewers.
[Random add to review (8/20)]: Actually, from this point on, the anime jumps around very much in terms of the time spent in the SAO world. I understand the novel may do something like this, but I kind of wanted to see the experiences everyone had during the weeks and months skipped. It confuses the viewers as to progression of the story, when we miss out on some points, go back to others, and make tangents into irrelevant stories altogether.
Episode 4, I personally don't even want to discuss it or review it in depth - it was just a huge turn for the worse. Basically, this episode's story revolves around a function in the game, followed by some background review of the main character, along with some loli-type fan-service. I suppose at the very least, it introduced a character to the story. However, when you show little girls in their underwear, and have them attacked by plant monsters who grapple her constantly like tentacles, I'm sorry, that's service.
Basically, from the end of episode 3, and the start and end of 4, I was thrown a little into dire questioning as to whether this anime was going to be worth watching for content gain.
3) An early final chance: episode 5
A final chance, indeed, a final chance to see if SAO would ever bring itself back up in episode 5. It was like opening another birthday gift after a series of bad gifts in the past, hoping this year I got what I wanted - plot, development, wit, and maybe even a little action here and there. But no dice; it was just deviation once again from all goodness. Basically, we are watching a detective side story now, where characters contemplate on who the murderer is based on game mechanics, guild and player relations, and a possible re-bridging between two main characters. Why am I suddenly subject to watching this? I suddenly understood why the character in episode 3 died without much regret - the world she lived in was designed by a poor staff of story writers. Alright, maybe that's a little harsh. But I cannot deny that this episode's story (or lack of) is not very favorable in terms of contributing to the major plot.
-----------------------------------------------
From this point on, I'd like to merely comment on each episode very broadly for the reader, so that they may have an idea whether the future of the anime is fitting to their tastes. Obviously, while I may have started out being very critical of SAO (do note, my criticisms will of course continue in places needed), there may be an episode here and there where I am obliged to say ""better /or good job"" to the producers.
-----------------------------------------------
(Episode 6 - Getting over the blues)
With a lowered, much lowered anticipation for the 6th episode, I pulled myself to watch the release 2 days later in a sort of painful obligation. Episode 6 would be a continuation to episode 5, a side story that I was not very fond of to start with, and I simply watched it to hold discussion with other reviewers. By the end of episode 6, I could say, I wasn't too wild about the episode like many of the episodes so far in this series, but it was not completely horrid. It was just partly annoying, hinting at romance between characters, discussing what ""love"" is in a paralleled view between reality and a virtual reality world, and further explaining a few more of the mechanics and social functions of the world of SAO. For the most part, the game presents itself as Kirito admits ""pretty fair"" and also in that sense""logical"", so the entire ghost theory of episode 5 is refuted by the series of events in episode 5. Personally, I was interested more in the PK guilds, and the fact some exist to be hired - does this suggest proxy assassinations will/have occur more in the world of SAO? What exactly does ""human"" life vs. ""user"" life mean to the players? I suppose once Kirito and Azuna finish another meal (as they often do now, you'll see in episode 6), we'll find out in SAO 7. 
-----------------------------------------------
(Episode 7 - A charming character)
From this episode on, and because of this episode, I have now begun to grade SAO more as a romance. Before you accuse me of calling SAO a harem, because it's not, I only state this because the trend of many episodes has been this formula:
Kirito meets a single female character, who is generally alone, or feels alone.
Kirito has a bonding with the character, and strengthens it with his own want to protect the character and his best efforts to keep them alive by soloing his fights before them.
The girl who is actively with Kirito in the episode is either touched or assured by Kirito's actions. They may or may not like him on a higher level, but surely they have a stronger want to connect with him.
I will say this - I can see how someone may mistaken this anime for a harem. If the light novel is like this as well, then I'm really hoping they don't follow the text, and actually do some creative liberty action here and there. To be honest, I like romance to some degree, but not like this. Not a strong protects the weak relations, not a forced scenario to ultimately make the female concede to a dominant male, not what they've done for half the show. 
I'm a little off track, but that's what I have to say. Feel free to agree or disagree on the view on romances.
Either way, episode 7 surprisingly offers another female character. This time, Kirito and the girl have a starting issue that puts the couple in a situation in which they must work together to finish. The girl is somewhat skeptical to Kirito's character at first, but shortly is attracted to Kirito's person. This episode has no ""implied"" romance, the girl basically confesses her love to him on two occasions. As the die-hard fans of SAO read my review, awaiting my usual bashing of details here and there - I must say: not impressed by episode, but interested in new character. 
Let me elaborate. Basically each new female character that Kirito has met after Asuna (the only strong independent woman so far), generally are portrayed as very fragile, and in need of Kirito's defense both mentally and physically (well, as physical as the game world goes). However, this new female character is refreshingly outgoing, has a little of that public charm, a little spunky, and is definitely not afraid to take emotional initiative. She's a little stronger than the rest so far is what I'm saying. Plus, her voice actress for me, seemed to click something right for once. No, I am not in love with her. 
If I watched episode 7 of SAO through a serious view: again, disappointed at the speed of unraveling the story and development between the characters (much too based on quick moments). Also, disappointed at not going back to plot, but just doing character introductions. Yes, hold your hats everyone, I know this is way early on, and character introductions are much needed, but make them stronger, more memorable, and balanced between development.
If I watched episode 7 of SAO through a romance-anime view: again, disappointed at the speed of unraveling the story and development between the characters (much too based on quick moments). But I somewhat enjoyed more thanks to a like-able character. If you must make SAO a romance, then this is one of the better episodes to fit that genre so far. 
-----------------------------------------------
(Episode 8 - Issues Begin)
After episode 7, I had a better feel to watch episode 8 a little more on time (a day or so late), so I pursued the next segment with a little hope in my heart. At the end of this one, I will say, finally some more player-based issues have come up to trouble the originally care-free Kirito. But naturally, the episode still comes off very weak, with again, more eating scenes that take up a huge chunk of time, and fan service. But, at least it seems something is coming up. The problem is, the oncoming struggles the characters go through now, are created and resolved in a way that seems more fit for adolescent viewers. Much like an episode of Pokemon (or something like that), we have had and are having issues that occur in a 1-2 episode arc: having a regular antagonist faction, having friends quickly met and left, quick solves to most dilemmas, a main character who involves himself in as many matters as possible on his one-man adventure that is slowly not becoming the case. I could go on with the themes, but that obviously is once again, going off topic.
Let's have a change of pace, let's talk about things I liked, and things I didn't in list form.
Likes:
 * Inter-player conflicts
 * Asuna and Kirito are a duo (Why do I like it? It just suggests to me the main plot may be closer to being tackled.)
 * Players question their existence more, bringing the question of ""what is reality?"" before them once more. Is reality an actual place? Or is it what's before you now?
Dislikes:
 * Fan-service (I think this is one of the reasons I don't like Asuna - I know she's drawn as an attractive character, but why does she need to be a sex symbol and a main character?)
 * Cliches within the conflicts (evil group tries to sabotage and kill players, jealous member, seen it, mix it up; take a fiction course or something to develop your characters, SAO)
 * Romantic tension between Kirito and Asuna - gag me with a spoon.
But here's the thing: this episode leaves you off with a cliff-hanger (sort of). I have some ideas of what's to happen if I follow a simpler plot-developing though process, but I'll let SAO surprise me.
-----------------------------------------------
(Episode 9 - It just got better)
So I finished 9 along with 10, because of real life issues (something those in SAO aren't experiencing...har har), and let's start off the new review branch with episode 9: it was not bad at all.
So basically in this episode, we're going to finish off that cliff-hanger we got in episode 8. The reason why this episode was so enjoyable, was a merging of both things of the past, along with new elements. Plus, the whole episode revolved around player relations tied in to a raid. I don't know about you, but in an anime that revolves around a life and death MMORPG, I've been craving a long awaited fight scene and tension between said life and death. Fighting scenes are often viewed as filler for some anime, but in this particular episode, the fight brought out a lot of hidden things about characters: their abilities and emotions. My critics who are looking for me to throw in things that I hated about this episode: probably just the small eating scene the storyboard at SAO can't stop trying to sneak in. I know food is an important element and joy to the characters in SAO, but when you throw it in so many times, I start to wonder if I'm watching a slice of life.
[Spoiler]: Sorry, I have to mention this - Klein comes back for this one. Klein is perhaps one of the only characters I like in this anime, for a couple of reasons that I won't go into detail.
-----------------------------------------------
(Episode 10 - Take me back to episode 9, please)
So episode 10 fell short of expectations after episode 9; why they keep playing around with my hopes is beyond me. Anyways, in this episode Kirito basically goes through many ordeals with Azuna that are either the off-product of hanging out with Azuna or related to her. It starts out like something big will happen, but soon you realize you're sort of watching a rigid denouement. I think for the first half of it, I was still sort of interested in what was happening...
...Until the romance scenes came back. But wait! The romance this time is different - far far different from the flirtatious moments of the past. I will say this - in a sense it's fanservice coming back, but in another, we're almost seeing an adult moment where two people are making a romantic commitment. Sort of. Don't think too hard about it. Let me just say, the whole watching, I kept thinking ""wait, stop, you're both under-aged!""
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far, this anime for more objective viewers may not impress you very highly. I myself give this anime a 4 or 5 out of 10 so far.
But, there's good news - this series is not over yet. Perhaps this is all one big misunderstanding, and one day we will get back on track to the good stuff. Maybe we're just getting the filler now, to avoid it in the future. But as of now:
5/10",5
"
                A lot of things has already been mentioned for this anime. Of course I will not repeat them all and this is all based on my personal preference. 
SAO had an amazing plot which made me interested. It was like watching a series of the move ""STAY ALIVE"" though I personally prefer the movie compared to this series. Moving forward:
What I like about the anime:
Art - yes, the only thing I liked about this anime. Art was wonderful (period).
What I did not like about the anime:
Story Progress - though SAO had an amazing plot, the story progress was too fast and had too many holes
                  that anything could happen (ex. from ep.1-ep.2). Many things could possibly happen but noooo, they decided to skip it all. The final straw would have to the episode that was nearing the end of the 1st Arc which was the boss fight (not final boss). I stopped caring for the anime at this point.
Sound - not sure. I didn't notice any heart warming sounds that would touch my soul and make me warm and fuzzy inside.
Character Development - harem. harem. harem. Which is funny since this is based on a MMO where one would expect there should be lots of guys but meh
------------
All in all, I have dropped this anime at the start of the 2nd Arc but since I was forced to watch up to episode 19, I still don't have the heart to continue this anime.",4

                I've been meaning to write a review for SAO for a very long time now. Before starting I would urge anyone to please not press helpful/unhelpful button by solely seeing the score. Another thing, I'm not good at writing reviews so if you find my review bad, please feel free to press the unhelpful button.
I would normally have given SAO an easy 10 since I absolutely love this series but since this is a review, I have to be subjective. 
Here is an overview of the scores I gave.
Story: (Plot and Execution) 8/10
Art: 9/10
Sound:9/10
Charcater: 7/10Enjoyment: 10/10
Sword Art Online has a very interesting plot, heck it is one of my favourite. Thousands of players trapped inside the most popular and enticipated MMORPG games in their era. Death in game means death in real life. This is the basic setting. Kirito is a skilled gamer who has participated in the Beta version of the game so he has an edge over most of the trapped players. 
The story takes a shift and becomes a little less serious as it progresses and suddenly shifts to romance and light hearted tone. Now despite I love the series I also have little complains here and there. I liked the romance part but making it one of the main themes was a little disappointing. It should have continued in a more serious tone. Not only romance was disspointing but it seemed a little forced. By this I mean that Asuna's overall character was very weak and that made some of the views dissappointed. Other characters were also somehow forced to Kirito's harem for no particular reason but the harem isn't really that strong and is usually ignored. The second half did not please many viewers as most of them wanted the first arc to be made a little longer but the second arc was by no means bad. Sure the incest part was a little stupid but luckily no major developements happened. Battle scenes in the whole series were good however were present in a very little amount but nothing that really made me feel bad about it. 
But what makes the SAO series special is that despite everything, it was yet so enjoyable and addicting to watch. There were a lot of positives for the series as well. An interesting setting with a badass protagonist. Beautiful animation with great osts. A great room for character developement. Moreover, there were emotional moments, struggles and funny moments. The sense of adventure made the series really refreshing. And what really made the series a lot more enjoyable was the concept of being in a game. Leveling up, forming guilds, impoving skills, finding items and game like environment. 
I absolutely loved the openings, endings, osts, art. They were all great. Overall it is a really enjoyable series, somehow doesn't appeal to some but it is a great series to start getting into anime. I personally feel that the haters are jelous of the achievements and popularity this series has. Yet they don't realize that it has helped the anime community to grow by a fair amount. Despite it's flaws, it's a really enjoyable series and by no means deserves the amount of hate it has. This series really did help me at a time I lost interest in anime despite the fact I only had watched about 50 series at that time. It was really easy to get into and be immeresed in the storyline. Despite how many other great series I watch, this will always have a special spot in my list.
I may have missed some things but I tried my best not be biased towards it. You are free to appreciate or bash about my review at my comments section.
I really do recommend this series to anyone who hasn't watched it due to the hate it gets, who knows someone may really like it. It is really easy to get into it so anyone can give it a try.",9
"
                The infamous SAO truly is an extremely controversial show that makes people fight like angry chickens that just don't know when to stop and think about it without adding too much personal enjoyments into it. This is going to be a rather long review so bare with me.
As a person who actually somehow enjoyed the series for at least some of its screen times, I shall try to put my thinking cap on and talk about this piece on a critical standpoint. 
All constructive criticism is welcomed via PM or comment. They well be greatly appreciated. 
STORY (Concept 3/5, development 1/5)
Sword Art Online is not
                  the first anime that has a setting in MMORPG (shout out to .Hack sign). With that in mind, I should definitely give it less credit for being ""original"". What SAO did was to implement the very popular visual reality gaming system to the show to make all those otakus and video gamers find ""relatable"" and ""OMG this is awesome"". Now looking at the world of SAO. Basically people needs to beat the game in order to get out of the visual world. The one-hundred floor idea is very generic, but hey it works every time (shout out to Mashin Hero Wataru). As for the second arc universe, well just your very typical fairy videogame that nobody plays in real life... 
All things considered, SAO did have a fairly interesting setting that is good enough to attract many if not most anime fans to watch it. 
Ha. Ha. Ha. Alright let's talk about the actually plot. After rewatching the second time, I can confidently say that the first 6 episodes are actually really well executed. It did a great job introducing the plot and character and seemingly promising story. 
I was so damn wrong. Despite the major plot twists, the quality of the story certainly doesn't meet my expectation. Alright so why is this 2-years time in the game summarized in 3 episodes? Come on it is like that the game is no longer a concern. Sure some people may say this is a way to create the a not-so-flat plot but it just doesn't do enough. This practice just makes the plot flatter and uninteresting. As a shounen anime, implementing a half-assed love story is simply stupid. (Yes, it comes back in the second season but that doesn't justify the decision. ) And with the addition of multiple filler episodes that has nothing to do with the storyline other than adding a new girl in Kirito's harem. There are however, some truly good moments, including but not limited to ""Kirito joining a small guild"" mini arc.
If the first arc of SAO was a ""yea-whatever"". The second arc is a ""f*ck it"". Rather than a continuation, the second arc is more like a restart. The characters have a new goal that has basically nothing to do what all the emotion and goodness established in the first arc. Everything is just gone. The villains were like random characters popping out of nowhere and the mighty hero Kirito just has to defeat the bad guy and save the girl. This reminds me of Mario. The random meaningless sister character comes into play like a distraction rather than a supporting cast. The entire arc just has too many ""wtf"" moments that I'm not going to point them out here. 
At the end of the day, I personally enjoyed it. I enjoyed it not because of it's awesome ""plot"", but rather the stupidity the plot offers. 
CHARACTERS (Design 2.5/5, development 0.5/5)
The characters in this series, for a lack of better term, cliche. All the characters are too typical to be interesting. They are just one dimensional characters that has no complex personalities. They are like Pokemons that are given one specific property and they always act accordingly. 
Three characters are worth mentioning here. The mighty Kiriro, his girl Asuna and his sister Boobs. Oh I meant Suguha. 
Kirito is every MMO player's dream. The eternal badass nature of him has created a symbol in many people's minds. I'm sorry but there is no way you can be the strongest person in an MMO without playing with other people. He is very indecisive, but in critical moments he is able to win the battle with the power of friendship. Ha. If a character truly received development in the series, it's gonna be him. In the beginning of the show he believes he is the strongest and playing with others will only make others in danger. This is showed in a mini arc and honestly I thought that was the only part of story that was well done. At the end  he learned the power of friendship and began fight with girls. Yea, that's it for him. 
His girl Asuna starts out to be interesting. A strong character who makes her way to a good position in a guild and fight extremely well. But after a while, she becomes weak and rely on his mighty Kirito. In the second arc, nvm I'm not even gonna mention what she looks like. 
His sister was so freaking bad. I can't even describe the person. Rather than a main character that supports Kirito in his Journey in the new world, she is more like a companion pet that is overly attached to his brother... She did change a bit however. She wasn't into the games too much first but after the journey she understands it a bit more and that's all there is. 
Honestly, the characters are very bad. Despite that bad design and development, the characters are fairly entertaining and boring. If you enjoy it, good job, if you don't, well, I guess you didn't take your brain out. 
GRAPHIC (Art 5/5, Animation 3/5) 
With all those mediocre plot and character, the art is truly a savier. The character style is fairly unique as I cannot recall any other anime with similar art style. The background are also beautiful with extraordinary landscape. 
""Animation 3/5? Are you serious? The actions in the show is AMAZING!"" You may be right. The action scenes are very well rendered and the flashy, multicolored light are very cool indeed. But I'm not sure if ""good animation"" can be summarized with ""flashy light and smooth movement"". If we go to the scenes where their aren't supposed to be a fight, we can see clearly how lazy and cheap the production team is. Still images aside, in a scene where Kirito is drinking tea in the bar, there is a shot of the drink he is drinking. As short as the shot may be, the glare on the drink is literally made of two white lines moving around. Hello? this is 2012, can you at least make it a little bit complicated and detailed? Even Cowboy Bebop has more detailed animations in these objects. 
All things considered, the graphic in SAO is quite good. But considering the budget the team has, they really could have done much better. 
SOUND (OP/ED 3/3, OST 2.5/3, Dub/Sub 3/4)
If there is one thing I love about SAO, it is gotta be the music. Lisa's opening is very well written and directed. It has this action packed yet emotionally expressive feeling to it. They are also very memorable as one can easily remind themselves SAO whenever they hear the songs. Well done. 
The OST are very good as well. It has this exciting but not brutal music during the fight, and when the show gets emotional, the music is also fitting. The problem is that, the show doesn't really have any soundtracks that stand out so I can recognize that ""oh, this is an OST from SAO!"". 
The dub is passable as the emotions can be expressed in the voice actors. The problem is most of the time it is just boring monologues. The sub actually suffers similar problem. I don't understand Japanese, but there really isn't anything extraordinary going on. I feel like some voices aren't even from the character's mouth. They feel like those bad voiceover TV shows that lacks realistic feeling. Again, it is just my feeling. Honestly the dub and sub doesn't matter as there really isn't much cultural elements. 
ENJOYMENT (7/10)
I loved it! I love how this ridiculous show can be that entertaining. I had millions of facepalm moments and that's fine! At the end of the day, it made me laugh and I would probably recommend it to my friends just for the sake of laughing at it afterwards. It is popular, it is worth checking out. 
OVERALL (6/10)
Well, this show certainly has its quality to absorb so much fans and love as well as criticism and hates. But since a review should be reviewed objectively, I wouldn't call this anime a well made production. It does leaves memorable symbols such as the SAO worlds and the Mighty hero Kirito, but other than that it is pretty shit. (Remember Doraemon? Everyone remembers it, but if you look at it closely... it's bad."" 
Peace.",6
"
                Well to start off with , Its a great anime and i recommend it to any whom watch a lot or very little , 
In my opinion it covers very many different genres of anime so it's great for anyone ! The story line will continue and can continue for ages which is the bonus , the side stories included are different every time and have a sense of mystery to them all . 
 - Its a good idea and very well presented in how everything is said and portrayed .
 - The thought to make an animated story about the world in the
                  future is great ! And especially how our technology is slowly taking over and the loss of live through people who want to be feared and want power and will do anything to achieve that .
 - The characters are probably the most detailed thing in the anime which is good , they all have some sort of background and are very thought through ... The producers weren't afraid to make the main characters have a other not so lovable side which builds the personalty of the character and gives the impression ""Anything can Happen"" .
 - To be honest the story line in my opinion can be predictable but most anime's are , i say this but some of the things that have happened weren't something that i expected ... So you can expect a mix of not expected and expected things to occur .
I want to thank you for reading this if you have :D It's not the best nor the longest but its for the people whom like a short description on whether or not to watch it . 
Overall i would recommend anyone to watch it and take your time to take in everything that happens !!",10

                Most of you probably would imagine that someday we'll reach a concept of a computer game in which we would play being ""inside"" our character and experiencing eveything from their prespective. What Sword Art Online does is bringing this seemingly interesting idea into life. And fails at it miserably.
First things first. SAO incarnates two already known concepts together: creating a virtual reality game which you connect to with special helmet-type devices and then imprisoning all the players inside the game till they complete it, making it so their death in game will cause the device they connect with to end their real life as well.
                  Here is basically where the very first plotholes of the series begin to show off. How can you explain that it wouldn't be enough to get those people back simply by cutting the power off the helmets? Internal battery? Well fine, but how long can an internal battery of the device that is permanently sending signals to your brain run, even speaking of the (not very distant) future? Even if, it would only take someone to destroy the thing from outside by just cutting some cables in it. Or you could just physically annihilate the game servers which belonged to a public-known company. However, eventually noone from outside ever consired those options and thus 10 thousand people were stuck in this digital world. And this only opens the very long list of this series' plotholes.
The main character of SAO is Kirito. Looking like a typical visual novel character, but behaving more like Hei from Darker than Black as he can manage everything and has an inborn advantage over all the rest. As the only person in the game he tries to beat it alone which makes him achieve better statistics than others, although it is never shown to us how he manages to do it... Just at some point we get to know that Kirito is about 20 levels above the regular players. It needs no explanation that watching a character experiencing no hardships whatsover is not very satisfying, especially when you have bery little idea about how he got to that state. Shounen obvously wouldn't be a shounen without a female partner of the main hero and this role was assigned to Asuna. Till some point she actually keeps up with his pace, but finally she turns out to be merely a character that just needs to be saved by the main hero (not the only one to that). I can kind of compare her to Orihime from Bleach (or to Yin if you want to stay with DtB version), but if the second season of SAO is true she may even get promoted to second princess Peach. When the second arc begins, the third key character is introduced to the series and that one seems pretty similiar to Karen-chan from Monogatari series (the comparison is not coincidencial, because since she comes out half of the show's air time is filled with her cleavage shots alone...). Thanks to her something like a love triangle appears as well, but it is so poorly done and executed (I'm not even sure about it) that  despite my strongest efforts I can't even call it a better love story than Twilight.
The plot of SAO was divided into two parts and although the first one is commonly believed to be the better one, I have a different view on this topic. It is because most of the series' plotholes and weirdness is contained within the first 14 episodes. My favourite one of those was the fact that amongside the lucky 10,000 first buyers of the limited edition of the new mmorpg game you could not only find female customers (and lots of them in fact), but also... Retired people and kindergartenrs. Yep. I'm not even kidding. Being at this it's hard not to mention the author of the game himself, the one who caused the sufferening to the ""lucky"" customers. It is taken for granted that villains have their own motives, usually something they want to achieve with their actions. I don't want to spoil you what's hiding behind this particular case, though I will say that the answer is extremely dissapointing and clearly shows how little effort the plot creators put in the title.
What tries to save the anime is the audiovisual layer. However I will admit that the graphics aren't at all that much great. Action scenes are fine, but there aren't that many of them and they're not packed with special effects. And that's a pity, cause we have an anime that is showing a computer game, so it could at least try more, for example by including some nice looking CGI graphics! What I must praise is the OST of the series. And not even the openings (I felt that the second was better btw), but mostly the background music. It's really cool and climatic and you can hear lots of it, especially closer towards the ending. In my opinion it's clearly the best aspect of the show.
To sum things up, despite a very ambitious concept, SAO remains a mediocre shounen deprived of any greater ambitions. Numerous plotholes, unoriginal and rather disturbing characters and the fact that the anime doesn't really keep you watching it makes it barely possible for me to recommend it to anyone. I hope that someday someone will try to touch this interesting theme once more and this time do it some honor.",5

                Due to horrible character development, the overall story suffers from a lack of enjoyment. Reason behind this is simple, if WE the Viewers dislike the heroes in a story, there is little to no chance that we will enjoy the story that they are in. (Although school days remains to be my sole exception) 
The main character, Kirito is a nothing more than the ultimate wish-fulfilment character, Why? here are some of the reasons why, he is just unbearable as a protagonist.
A) Stupidly overpowered for unexplained reasons examaples include but are not limited to:
I) Obtaining a Game Master's ID card in order to access blocked
                  content of a game while the friggin game is still up and running.
II) Starting a NEW game and having all stats from his previous game being ported over making him look ""Newbie"" yet having all the epic stats and gear of a level capped character.
III) Getting KILLED and coming back long enough to deliever the final blow
B) Attracts anything with a woman's genitalia within a 10 mile radius
C) Is always right never wrong
All i got from watching 25 episodes from this is that Kirito is a awesome badass cause he's a lone wolf, wears black clothes, and is extremely good at video games. In 25 episodes there should be WAY MORE GODDAMN CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ON YOUR MAIN PROTAGONIST!
The Art and Music scores in this show are it's saving graces. The Animation at the boss battles are eye-gasms that will leave the most hardcore of RPG fans reaching for a box of tissues within a 10 mile radius. While the music score suits a majority of the situations that are currently portrayed on the screen.
The enjoyment factor varies from person to person. Depending on the type of person you are the rating can be very high or abysmally low. for example if you do not take this show seriously it is extremely enjoyable. If you are one of those who watch things for characters and plot this is the equivalent to the 2nd half of SEED Destiny.
 Overall this series is Over-Hyped, and  it Failed to deliver. Stick with the Light Novels, they are FAR superior to this over-rated pile of steaming shame. First half is fine, 2nd half was appalling. This show can only be enjoyed by those who cant give 2 flying rats about character development, Stay away unless you love Ultimate Wish-fulfillment characters Gary Stu's, and damsels in distress.",3

                           Sword Art Online can be summed up in a few words. Exciting, Fun, Entertaining, and Disappointing. Now everyone has been under reviewing this Anime and giving it a lot of hate. I want to give a fair and true review. So Here it is.
Story - 
           Sword Art Online's story for the first few episodes will get you excited. The music, amazing scene shots, and the intensity will bring you great enjoyment. I have never been drawn in by an anime with such few
                  episodes like this anime did. The Story focuses on Kirito. Kirito is a gamer who played SAO before in the beta. SAO is a virtual reality massive multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. And now he is in the full release of the game, ready to begin his journey. Then disaster strikes! He finds himself stuck in the game with thousands with him, only to realize that if he dies in the game he will die in real life. This is where SAO really shines. The concept of being stuck in a game is not new. But the way SAO handles this concept is great. You feel the characters emotions and can get behind Kirito's actions. Romance in SAO is also great! You feel the emotions coming from the characters and the show never pulls any cliche romance. 
Story Pace -
         Many feel SAO is rushed, for in the first few episodes the timeline jumps quite a alot.  Reviewers and ones who have seen this think that SAO simply jumps time without giving them room to breathe. In fact this should not be the case. SAO was a short novel and it follows it very loyally. The reason behind these jumps are in fact because the novel starts already (without giving anything way) in a fast timeline. Where some see it as jumping the gun, I see it being loyal to the novel.
- Negative 
          SAO starts great, in fact it would be a solid 9 if the story didn't fall to pieces. The first 14 episodes are amazing, an anime that keeps you wanting more and then it ends or it should have. The story could have ended there with episode 14 but it continues. In fact the original Short novel did end there and the anime should have as well. Granted the novel did continue due to poplar demand but if you watch the anime you will agree. So whats the problem with the other episodes? Well. many things for starters pacing. The story drags from here on. The since of urgency is gone. The fights are boring and don't make sense. The character Kiritio is on a mission and gets sidetracked half way which can make the audience a little angry. The thrown in romance ruins already a good already put together story. 
- Conclusion 
         SAO is great entertainment for the first 14 episodes. The thrill of this anime will effect you greatly, scenes are shot well, character development is great. Art and music is Amazing. This anime has pulled me in like no other. But I cant forgive the rest of the anime. If wasn't for the other episodes, this anime would be solid. And it doesn't help some fighting scenes are sloppy and to short.  In the end I say watch it you wont regret it, the first 14 episodes are worth it. Hey, and if you want to quite at episode 14 be my guest, you will thank me later.",8

                I don't really have much to add as far as reviewing it as a show goes. It's a shallow, pointless series full of wasted potential, plot holes, plot threads that go nowhere, one note characters, tedious romance fanservice, generic slapstick comedy you can see in any other unambitious show, and deus ex machina moments that don't have the good sense to at least be entertainingly stupid. The action scenes, while fluidly animated, get boring real fast because the game mechanics are not well established, rules are broken constantly, and the main character is ludicrously overpowered in using brute force as his only solution. The art
                  and animation are good, Yuki Kajiure's score is phoned in but still decent, and there are rare moments where it at least acknowledges interesting implications of its world that it never touches again.
Instead, I want to warn that the second half of this show (besides being utterly, irredeemably terrible even compared to the low standards of the first half) is some of the most distressingly sexist, misogynistic, utterly insensitive exploitative crap I've ever seen jammed into a mainstream series. If this was at least actual exploitation schlock like La Blue Girl, you'd just be getting what you paid for, but no. This series intended for teenagers gets incredibly, inappropriately rapey in ways that are offensive to a very real problem with society. The following are spoilers, but I don't want you to give money to these people, so I don't care.
Amongst other things, this show has an incest subplot (barely worth mentioning compared to the other stuff, sadly) and a rapist villain in his forties or fifties that has somehow convinced the parents of a 17 year old comatose girl to let him ""marry"" her without either her informed consent or the expectation she'll ever wake up. He has her mentally trapped in a virtual world where she's kept in a cage and emotionally abused by him constantly.
There are threats of brainwashing, a tentacle groping scene, and the penultimate episode has him chain her down and rip her clothes off so he can molest her in front of the main character while promising he's going to do the same to her in real life (apparently, her luxury hospital has zero security and no concept of visiting hours). None of this is explored in any meaningful way; it is using a topic that psychologically scars people for life as cheap shock material.
And I just wanted a show about a virtual death world that requires creative thinking in video game mechanics to succeed instead of one part boring action, six parts boring romance, and fifty parts ""what the goddamn hell is wrong with you people!?""",2

                SAO is a Virtual Reality MMORPG. The basic Premise is that players are trapped in this VR world and are unable to log out. If the player dies in the game or someone tries to remove their Nerve Gear, the player will die in real life. The only way to leave the game alive is to beat it.
Story:  What started off interesting quickly took a turn for the worse. The story is riddled with inconsistencies and inconveniences, almost as if intentionally. One moment The focus is on beating the game, the next moment we have ""romance"" for lack of a better word just shoved
                  into our faces. Protagonists devolve from two of the most powerful players sure to beat the game, into a prepubescent married couple adopting a child and living in a cabin out in the woods. And it gets much worse. The ending to the first arc is one big slap in the face, no valid explanation given or clever twists to lead into the next arc. The second and final arc is basically a save-the-princess type scenario. All the same problems are present here, except worse.
Characters: Another major problem with SAO. Every single character is so one dimensional. First off we have the male protagonist, Kirito, who, unlike in most shounen anime, doesn't become stronger over time or gain strength from protecting those around him. No. He just pulls power, abilities and stats out his ass with no explanation. It's even worse in the second arc when he goes into the new game and somehow has the same stats in the first arc, while everyone else is level 1. He's just completely bland and uninteresting. Ofcourse he's a solo player that wears all black because he's so dark and mysterious and so cool...not. He's a ""solo player"" who mostly ends up fighting alongside others. He is essentially what most guys want to be; handsome, mysterious, girls fall for him without even trying, has prettiest the wife/girlfriend, strongest in the world, etc. Basically everything is handed to him. Every trait Kirito has is there to serve as pure wish fulfillment so that any guy could see themselves just waking up as Kirito one day. Moving onto Asuna, the first arc's female protagonist. She actually starts out promising. One of the strongest players and a girl?! But ofcourse she quickly becomes nothing more than fan service fodder for Kirito's lust, serving only to be his wife and cook. Oh, and the mother of their adopted child...Then we have Suguha, Kirito's sister but really cousin. The typical incestuous ""romance"" / love interest. Every single other character is just there to serve as a love interest for Kirito or an enemy for him to defeat. Basically every character is there as filler for Kirito to be seen as God like.
Art/Music: Just about the only acceptable part of this anime. Aside from the single still frame combat sequences, the landscape is quite nice, just what you'd expect from your modern MMORPG, massive forests, brightly lit up and decorated towns. The sound track are nothing to be scoffed at either, especially the battle theme when Kirito goes into bad ass mode (with little to no effort.) 
Overall: Just like with any game, as most gamers agree, graphics don't amount to much if the game play and community are steaming hot pile of...rubish.  SAO suffers the same fate, while it has some qualities such as a decent sound track and art, they pale in comparison to how frustratingly terrible everything else is that they are completely overshadowed and any benefits gained from them are negligible. SAO, lucky to even receive a 1/10.",1
"
                Looking for a show with brilliant, unique characters and a deep, incredibly meaningful story with beautifully executed plot twists that'll have you coming back for more and more? 
You'll have to look somewhere else, because personally, the only reason I came back for more and more after maybe, the tenth or eleventh (?) episode was to laugh at how absolutely  bullshit the show had gotten.
Don't get me wrong: it's not like I wasn't bursting with excitement the first couple episodes. I went through the first six episodes so fast  that I almost took a piss in my pants because I didn't want to
                  stop watching. The art and more importantly, the animation, was stunning. The soundtrack was pretty great, too, and they totally added that extra spark to every battle scene.
Now, if you've so much as even watched an episode of SAO after Kirito and Asuna get married, you'd know that exact moment where everything went downhill. Now, I'm a huge fan of shoujo, but if I wanted some mushy romance, I would've watched some mushy romance. I have never, ever, in my whole life seen a show where character development could be completely halted by the union of man and wife---that is, before I watched SAO. 
To be honest, after the show started using married life as a basis for plot development, I kind of turned off my brain and started watching the animation. Holy shit, that's some quality work. You don't know true talent until you know what animators go through, trying to animate twelve knives coming at one guy without a single kink. Cheers to animators everywhere. Great job, guys.
Don't get me started on the ALO arc. Really, I'm not even going to get started. I don't known what that was, and honestly, I have a feeling that if I find out what that bullshit was, I'll be more disappointed than I've ever been before. 
I'm watching SAO II this season for some unfathomable reason, and I hate myself for it, but it's still better than the ALO arc. I keep coming back for more, to laugh at it, but the fact of the matter is that the pure awfulness of SAO kind of has a special place in your heart once you've gone through the hell that is twenty-six episodes of total ass, and it can never be replaced by any other shitty show. 
Do I recommend this show? Not under any circumstances. But if you do watch it, or have watched it, and understand me, hit me up. I never miss a chance to laugh about how awful SAO was, but it's always with a certain fondness in my heart.",4
"
                I must say i really liked the first half of the series. I won't say the premise is original, but it is very interesting, and the first two episodes will have you on the edge of your seat.
The problem, maybe, is the pace in which this story was told. There are lots of time skips that sometimes make you angry, and lots of random episodes that seem to be irrational filler that give nothing to support the plot.
But if you can make a blind eye to the unnecessary fanservice and filler, the first 14 episodes are really enjoyable, and, at least the final episode of
                  this arc was surprising and rewarding. 
So if you are planning to watch it, the first part of the show works pretty well on it's own, and even if it's not perfect (in my opinion) it's very enjoyable. 
Now, the real problem is the second arc of the season which starts in episode 15. 
Not only it lacks of a real plot whatsoever, but it feels completely unnecessary, and the show just goes downhill from here. 
Our once ""strong"" female lead is held hostage until the end of the season by the villain of turn, whose only real motivation is... marrying a comatose girl against her consent, and probably rape her?...there are other things going on, but everything is so uninteresting that you will probably be banging your head against the wall until the end of the season. 
The last episode does gives you a good closure to the WHOLE experience, but it isn't worth the pain of watching this 11 train-wrecking episodes that ruined the whole thing for me. 
So, my recommendation is to watch just the first 14 episodes, and if you are really curious, watch episode 25 in the end. You won't be missing anything at all. 
My rating of ""7"" is just for the first half of the series which i think fulfills the objective of entertaining the viewers (which, seriously, it IS the objective of every show). I would give the second half a 3, but i don't want to bring down the first part that works well on its own.",7

                It would be hard for me to write not just something for this anime (because it is ranked # 44 in the top anime of MAL) so forgive me if I offend somebody out here because of this review. I'm also a fan of MMORPGs (Ragnarok & Grand Chase to name a few).
Before I start, don't do what I did. I dropped SAO after the first episode because there are no girls in the first episode (sorry for the spoiler. I'm a BIG fan of Harem animes.) and only picked it up again after the 5th episode.
Let's begin
Story: As simple as it gets, this anime
                  is based on a concept ""Kill or be killed"". The story development is just plain. There are some introductory episodes for new characters or new weapons. The drama is there especially when somebody gets killed. We also have a little bit of romance. To summarize: SAO is something when it comes to the story. It might be a plain old cliche when it comes to shows or something but the story development is just too amazing (even though IT IS a little bit slow). I'm currently on episode 09 and YES, I regret what I did when I almost dropped this show.
Art: I've compared the manga from the anime and found out that Asuna is just too damn hot in the anime! (Sorry for the word. I can't use the F word in here). Even the swords which are the main focus of this anime are drawn almost to perfection. The characters' facial expressions are just amazing.
Sound: THANK GOD FOR MAKING LiSA! The OP single (Crossing Field) is just too catchy. I usually skip the OP video but when it comes to this anime, I don't skip it because the song is perfect for the OP video (especially the English part). The chorus part is full of action in the OP video. 
The ED single, Yume Sekai (Dream World) which was sang by Asuna's seiyuu (Tomatsu Haruka) is good. A perfect song for ending an anime (like Life is Like a Boat in Bleach). By the way, if you've watched Ano Natsu de Matteru and want to hear Ichika Takatsuki sing, then listen to Yume Sekai (since Asuna and Ichika have the same seiyuu).
Character: Character development is too good for this anime. The writer has successfully shown how character development should be done and he did it in a way which I can say is so damn good! Unlike other anime in which all the characters are introduced in episode one (in which name confusion starts for people who watch), up until episode seven, characters are still introduced in a fascinating way. I've checked the casting for SAO in MAL and I know other characters are gonna get introduced soon enough.
Enjoyment: Fan of MMORPGs? Then pick this show up. You won't regret it I swear. I'm betting my HDD for reformat if you didn't enjoy this show.",10

                Sword Art Online Review
Sword Art Online is a very flawed yet very enjoyable show. Many people will often either deem it the best show in the world or the worst show in the world.
I am a big fan of the show and it is currently my absolute favorite at the moment but let me start with the flaws that the series had.
Flaws:
Time Skips / Pacing
I felt that the biggest flaw of the show was the inconsistencies with time gaps. This is mainly an issue with the first half of the series (Aincrad Arc). I had a friend that watched the second episode (clearing the first
                  floor) and then the third episode (Kirito joins Moonlit Black Cats) and he called me to ask if he had missed a few episodes or something.
I suppose there wasn’t much that could be done because the light novel was sort of written that way. “Floor by floor” side stories were only added later which is why the first half of the series felt a little inconsistent episode by episode. Time would skip and we would be left wondering what happened on the floors that were never shown.
That was my only main issue with the first half of the season.
Not Enough Side Character Love
I loved all of the characters that were in this show but I feel that the flaw was that many were not given the screen time that they deserved.
Klein, for example, was setup to be a very important character based on the first episode but he quickly disappears for the majority of the series.
Many others only appeared in about 1-2 episodes and that was it. 
Nerfing Asuna
I personally really liked Asuna as a heroine. It was cool that she was sometimes able to save Kirito too and that she had a high place in her guild, Knights of the Blood Oath. I did not hate the second half of the season (Fairy Dance Arc) but I felt that it was far inferior to the first half.
Asuna almost seemed like a totally different person. Her sexuality became her main attribute. I felt that it was totally unnecessary to have her be nearly tentacle raped. I do not watch hentai or anything so it was uncomfortable for me to see that.
Her escape attempt was also pretty pathetic. I felt that Asuna from Aincrad would not have been as careless and impatient.
Incest
This is also an issue with the second half of the season. I thought that it was just weird to have Suguha fall in love with her brother/cousin. I did end up feeling really bad for her because she just seemed like a confused hormonal tween that didn’t know any better but I still wish that that was not apart of the story.
Strengths:
Great Action
The action scenes in this show were amazing. Many people that mostly hate the show can at least agree that the fight scenes were beautifully done. I only wish that there were more floors shown so that there were more than just a few boss fights shown on screen. Watching the fight scenes always felt so intense to me.
Romance
Many people would see this as a flaw, but I honestly loved Asuna and Kirito’s romance. It was cool to see them get together sooner than later. Perhaps it’s just because it reminded me of my very first relationship because it was also very innocent and fairytale-like and many could not believe that it was happening because it seemed so unrealistic.
I am also a sucker for love stories.
Relatable Character (Kirito)
Kirito was very relatable to me in many ways. This may not apply to others that do not connect with him the same way I did. Ever since 2003, I have been playing a lot of MMORPGs with my friends. Everything from Runescape to Ragnarok to WoW to Guild Wars etc. I was never a god like Kirito, but my friends that I played with tended to consider me really really good so my friends always like to joke that I am the Kirito of our group in that regard when we are playing online games.
I am a very social person now, but when I was younger I was like Kirito where I was a bit antisocial and it reminded me of those times. He coped with situations in similar ways to how I did.
I also did not meet several girls that fell in love with me in video games, but in real life I have had my fair share of overly attached girls that have clung to me and I related to Kirito in that regard. My female friends say that I have no radar for crazy girls or girls that fall for me and I’m always oblivious to it so my friends always joke that I am like Kirito in that way too.
I am by no means a carbon copy of him or anything, but there were many aspects with his character that I connected with.
Variety of Story-lines
While the time skips in Aincrad made me sad due to wondering what happened on floors that were never shown, I always enjoyed the side stories. Some would have preferred if the show only stuck to clearing boss floors, I enjoyed the stories of Kirito helping out weaker players, or solving the murder case, or getting the dark repulser made. I thought it added a nice change of pace!
It also had a fair share of humor to balance the depressing deaths that took place in the game.
Music
The music is very enjoyabl. Crossing Field, the opening song for the first half of the season, always got me pumped up before the episode. It is one of the few anime intros that I actually do not skip regularly.
Also, the sad music always was so fitting for the emotional scenes, the fighting songs always pumped me up during intense fight scenes, and even the light-hearted songs for lighter scenes were always fitting too. I find myself humming the music from this series a lot.
Conclusion:
This show is nowhere near perfect and is filled with a lot of flaws. Despite that, the strengths of this show are so great and enjoyable that it outshines the flaws and I can highly recommend this show to you.
While stating that you dislike this show may make you appear to have a “better taste in Anime” due to its reputation, I would strongly suggest to at least give the show a chance and to not just write off.",9
"
                This is an amazing anime, a one of a kind. I will find that people are pissed about the anime going too fast, however I am grateful that the anime is actually going through the actual timeline, unlike the light novel and manga.
*may contain spoilers*
The Characters feel really realistic, and just like many people play as girls in MMOs, I laughed off my chair as I remembered many people actually did this a lot in many games that I played in. Also the names of these characters are really uncommon and are easy to remember their names as their character designs are very simple, giving
                  them roles that are amazingly fitting of them.
Characters 10/10 xD
The sound is nice! It reminds me greatly when I play MMOs and gives that same feeling, except it's amazingly close to reality, and you can just feel the excitement coming from the sounds as I watch this, and will get better.
Sound 8/10 :)
The story is just great! As I have watched and read over 1000 anime and manga, this is the first that it is about being inside a video game; and living inside of it, trying to survive, as death is the same as the real world. Therefore I give it a perfect score., because there is nothing cliche about this anime. I am positive the story will get better and better.
Story 10/10 :D
The art is just...perfect! well not really, but it show's everyone's expressions greatly and details are just flowing out naturally! Nevertheless Kirito and his outfit looks awesome. I haven't seen anime characters with such cool design. 9/10 Art!
Overall the anime is plain awesome. Need I say more? I will just say you will regret not watching this anime.
Overall 10/10 :DDDDDDD
Enjoyment? OF COURSE I ENJOYED IT! Heck, I would love to be in this setting of an anime, but I still hope gaming consoles will really come out in 202x
Enjoyment ∞/10
Oh also, I did this.
C.S.S.A.O.E. Carefully Savor Sword Art Online Everyday :)
Also thanks to everyone who read this review! :D",10

                (This is a descriptive review and my opinions on the anime to help new viewers)
Sword Art Online is one of the most impressive anime I've watched so far with its excellent artwork and animation. The story revolves around a virtual game where players play in a MMORPG with other real players. They wear virtual reality helmets to enter a virtual world but it's suddenly a death trap when players can't log out and the only way out is to clear the game by going to the last floor, 100. The deaths in the game leads to death in reality which pins many characters with one
                  another.
Story 10/10
The story is really simple but is a very appealing one with many side stories to show character development. To reach floor 100 to escape the game while avoiding death in the game. The concept of death in game and in reality is very unique. The realization that players who kill other players in game make them murderers in reality makes it frightening but also the fact that many children die in the game too. MOST IMPORTANTLY though is the developing relationship of Kirito and Asuna in the story while surviving in the virtual world, each episode that passes their relationship is enhanced while interacting with dangers. 
Artwork/Graphics 10/10
The visuals of SAO are amazing, there's no limits to the orientation because its a fantasy virtual world. The beautiful landscape designs make all more appealing in 1080p HD. Character designs are unique to the main characters as well, such as Kirito, a solo player with a black cloak makes him stand out from others while Asuna's matches her guild in the game. 
Animation 9/10
Animation is very great when it comes to the action scenes. They're fast paced and fluent with the scenarios. Sword fights are very amazing and speed up with the tension in the scene. 
Connections (Spoiler) : I've read the light novel and the story is very wonderful and romantic with a lot of emotion( I love it and I'm a guy). The anime is matching the plot with the Light Novel but also inserts side stories in from the novels as well (Silica Side Story Ep 4). 25 Episodes will maybe actually enough to cover the 1st and 2nd volumes of the Light Novel and if it's a success can lead to a Season 2 featuring volume 3 and 4. I believe this series has the potential to go beyond 2 seasons if they move through the plot thoroughly.
Last Comments: If you love fantasy,adventure,action, and some romance then this is the anime for you. The romance between the main protagonists develop more later on so rest assured.
Similiar Anime Recommendations: 
Accel World: The same writer as Sword Art and it's one of his newest works. A story in 2046 where the main character enters a virtual online fighting game to compete against others. It was recently aired before SAO and is on Hulu.
.hack//Sign: Same MMORPG setting and situation of not being able to log out. It's and old series but has the majority of the plot the same as SAO.",10

(The Good, the Bad, and the Average)
Ben, John, and Alex were all good friends. They lived in the same neighborhood for many years, and they were all anime fans. However, they differed in their ideals, their taste, and their viewing amounts.
Ben was an anime veteran, he had watched over a thousand series, mainly from the 1980s-2000s. He appreciated the old classics, such as Cowboy Bebop, Infinite Ryvius, etc. While, he preferred the old classics, he also liked some of the newer series. He likes shows with great story and relatable characters.
John was a newcomer to anime. He first watched Naruto and Full
                  Metal Alchemist, and then, from thereon, he continued watching other series, such as Your Lie in April, Guilty Crown, etc. He’s opened to any recommends, especially towards genres like shounen, romance, action, and comedy.
Alex was neither a stranger nor a veteran to anime. He had watched a modest amount of series, regardless of their genre. He had seen Kimi ni Todoke, Bleach, Psycho-Pass, etc. He doesn’t restrict himself to one genre, although he finds ecchi and excessive fanservice distasteful, he doesn’t mind. 
Even though, they had very different taste in genres and shows, they respected each others’ opinions. That is, until they discussed about Sword Art Online (SAO); an anime that tore their friendship apart.

Alex had just returned from school and was heading to Ben’s house. He took the usual route: passing by 7-11, climbing up the steep hill, and finally, entering the cul-de-sac. At the end of the road was Ben’s home. He rang the doorbell, and was greeted by Ben.
“Hey, man. What’s up.”
“Nothing much. Except that, the heat is killing me. Let’s go upstair,” said Alex.
“I know what you mean. There’s AC in my room. Let’s go.”
They walked upstairs and entered into Ben’s room. Upon entering, they spotted John, sitting at the computer, reading the latest chapter of One Piece. John noticed them, and turing his head said, “What’s up, Alex.” 
Alex responded, “Hey, John. You reading the latest chapter of One Piece?""
“Yeah. But, since you’re here. Let’s talk about SAO,” said John as he closed the browser and swiveled the chair.
Ben laid on his bed and, reaching towards his bookshelf, grabbed the manga Pluto. He noticed our gaze and said, “Don’t worry, I’m listening. I just need to finish this manga, it’s really good.”
Alex replied, “Coming from you. It must be good.”
“Damn right, it is,” he exclaimed.
John coughed and said, “Do you mind, but I want to talk about my impressions of SAO.”
“Sorry. Go ahead,” said Ben.
John took a deep breath and yelled, “My God. That anime was the shit! I don’t know why I’ve been putting it off. Maybe, it has something to do with all the haters saying it’s utter crap and shit. But, those haters can go fuck themselves. I enjoyed it and I think it’s one of the best animes ever!""
Ben stared at John with disbelief and said, “Man, you must have your eyes checked. I suggest you go to an optometrist, right away. Because that anime was utter shit. No, it was lower than shit. It was one of the worst animes that I have ever seen.""
John sighed and replied, “I knew this shit would happen. You’re alway hating something. And, while, I do agree to some extent, this time I totally disagree and I believe you...must have your eyes checked. Because, you must be blind.""
“Look…arguing like this, isn’t going to help. John, why don’t you explain your reasons for why SAO is one of the best animes ever? And, Ben, explain your reasons for why SAO is one of the worst animes ever. But, John goes first. Is that fine?” asked Alex.
“I’m cool with that,” Ben replied, “besides, I want to hear his reasons, too.”
John took a deep breath and said, “Okay. Let’s begin with the synopsis. When, I read the synopsis, I was immediately intrigued. I mean it involves a virtual reality MMORPG, in which players can control their avatars and do stuff, but then the creator removes the log out button and traps all the players in this virtual world. To escape, they must defeat each boss on all 100 floors. Now, here’s the problem, if the player dies in the game, then they die in real life. Doesn’t this premise, sound intriguing? To me, it does. And, I’m pretty sure, thousands of other people were intrigued by this.”
John continues, “Let’s discuss the atmosphere and world dynamics. The world of SAO is immersive, there are towns and cities, there are guilds and parties, there is crafting, fishing and other trades, there are a variety of weapons, food, and clothing, there are different enemies and NPC's, there are interesting bosses with unique move sets and abilities, and most importantly, there are other players that further enrich the world. All of these characteristics only enhance the story by showing the viewer that the world of SAO, isn’t some small or restricted area, but rather a vast, growing realm. Now, the world of ALO is, I admit, less developed and explained. There is some immersion, but not much. I mean, the flying mechanics is interesting, there are different races, and the world tree (i.e. Yggdrasil) is enormous and eye-catching. But, other than that, there’s nothing else. It’s a bare bone version of SAO.
“The art and sound are fantastic! The background art is detailed and vibrant, the key-frames are consistent and flowing, and the characters and enemies (bosses included) are vivid and striking. Now, the voice-acting is excellent, you can feel the emotion from the characters, such as anger or sadness, distinctly. The opening and ending are fine, and the background music, especially when Kirito faces bosses/dangerous enemies, is exhilarating and intense. The music fits the situation.
John stops to catch his breath and continues, ""Next, the characters aren’t perfect, but they are exceptional and engaging. Kirito is a motherfucking badass! Some people claim that he’s OP and invincible. I disagree, unlike some protagonist who are ridiculously OP in the beginning, Kirito wasn’t like that. He had to level up his avatar, find better equipment, and rely, not only on tactics, but sword skills and quick-thinking. Furthermore, since he was a beta tester, he has previous knowledge about the world of SAO, using this knowledge, he leveled up quickly, earned money quickly, and gained abilities (e.g. regeneration, dual blades, track, etc) that some people consider as OP. Now, Asuna is just as awesome, she isn’t just some useless girl. She can fight, using her fast sword skills, she is the vice-captain of the strongest guild in SAO, and she can cook and clean. She’s the perfect wife and who doesn’t want that? As, for the rest of the characters they received little development, but they aren’t really important. They only serve to further develop our two protagonists (Kirito and Asuna).
He continues, “And, finally, the story. It’s a simple story, I’m not going to lie. It’s simply about Kirito and his journey on how he freed everyone from the world of SAO. Along this journey, there are amazing boss battles, there are deeply emotion parts, such as the players of the Moonlit Black Cats guild getting viciously murdered or how Yui was ‘deleted’ by the Gamemaster, there is a deep romantic subplot involving Kirito and Asuna, and, finally, there are side stories that explain more about the world of SAO. As for ALO, it’s bit linear, I admit, but the plot is actually very good. It’s simply Kirito rescuing Asuna from the pervert, Oberon (i.e. Sugo). This arc further proves that Kirito is deeply in love with Asuna. In addition, there are multiple race encounters/awesome fight scenes, a conspiracy, and vengeance. These are all my reason for why SAO is one of the best animes ever.”
Ben claps his hands, sighs, and says, “Wow! That was quite an explanation. I’ll admit, I was really close to being convinced. Until, you talked about the characters and story. That was when I stopped being convinced. Because, those two sections were the worse part about SAO.”
Alex interrupted, “Okay. Ben, could you explain your reasons for why SAO is one of the worst animes ever.""
Certainly,” Ben replied, “I’ll try to keep it nice and short. There are two things, I shall admit: (1) the art and sound is very good, that’s a mistake on my part, and (2) the premise is indeed intriguing and draws the viewer’s interest. Now, I want to begin with the atmosphere and world building. The atmosphere for SAO, at first, was very tense; you are literally trapped in a virtual world, where one fuck up can kill you in the real world. But, then it lost its appeal, it started introducing other elements, such as romantic feelings from other girls (e.g. Silica, Sachi, Lizbeth, Asuna, Yui), a mystery event, fishing, in-game marriage, etc. Basically, there is no tension, the characters don’t exhibit that feeling of ‘Oh, Shit! I might die’, besides the first couple of episodes. But, you might say, “those details are used to build the world of SAO.” If that’s the case, then they did a piss poor job of explaining more about the world. What about red players, what is the penalty for killing a player? How do players gain an ability (i.e. regeneration, track, etc), is it by fulfilling a quest, gaining a level, or something else? What are the skills that players can invest points in? What about the lore, is there a backstory explaining the world and its environment? All these question and lack of explanations make me disappointed because, now, the story and its MMO concept is riddled with unexplained elements and potential plot holes. And don’t get me started with ALO, because there are more unexplained elements like what are the other races, what special abilities and skills do these races have, what are the items in this world, what are the penalties for dying, etc. Moreover, there is zero tension because the element ‘dying in the game means dying in the real world’ has been removed. Which leaves me to question: what is the point of a reviving a player if they are going to return back to the game? Moving on.
“Kirito is too OP, no matter how much you explain. Yeah, sure…Kirito was a beta tester and has previous knowledge about this world and its environment. And using this knowledge, he leveled up quickly and gained certain ‘abilities’. But, like I stated earlier, we don’t know his character skills or his chosen abilities, they all happen off-screen. His victories are won, not by tactics, but they steer lucky, brute force, and quick-thinking. Moreover, he has some kind of charisma to charm all the ladies that he encounters. Maybe, it’s because he is kind and caring? Just like any other harem protagonist. Oh, and I forgot, he’s also a detective and a hacker, too. Asuna is pretty much the perfect wife, like you said, she can cook, clean, and…fight! Oh, I forgot, she can also fight because she mostly stays in the kitchen, cooking for Kirito. And, let’s not forget, she has a somewhat of a tsundere attitude towards Kirito. Suguha is Kirito’s cousin, yeah, she provides some backstory for Kirito, but for most of the show, she’s there to support Kirito, be fanservice for the viewers, and provide shock value in the form of incest love. The villains are all one-dimensional, they have no personality and barely a motive for their actions. In fact, the first villain states that he ‘deliberately removed the log-out, so he can rule over it like a God’, but what sparks his interest remains unknown because he forgot. The second villain is a sadist bastard, he’s evil for the sake of being evil; there’s nothing good about him. All the other characters are forgettable because they barely get any screen time.”
Ben takes a breath and says, “And finally, let’s talk about the story. This is the worst section by far! There are too many side stories during the SAO plotline, such as 'The Red-Nosed Reindeer’, 'The Black Swordsman’, 'A Crime Within the Walls’, and 'Warmth of the Heart.’ If you checked out the light novels, then you would know that those stories aren’t part of the plotline, but rather are a collection of short stories. Sure, I admit, they have some relevances because it explains more about the game mechanics and its world environment. But, was it necessary to have the side stories involve a girl having some feelings for Kirito? No, it’s not necessary, adding those elements only makes Kirito a walking ladies’ man. Next, there are too many Deus Ex Machina moments like (1) when Kirito faces a boss and is about to be defeated, he somehow is able to wield two swords and defeat the boss, or (2) when Kirito is about to be killed by Kuradeel, Asuna shows up at the right time and save him, or (3) when Kirito and Asuna are about to be killed by a boss called the ""Fatal Scythe”, Yui blocks the attacks and kills it, furthermore she suddenly remembers that she’s a fucking AI program, or (4) when Kirito is killed by Healthcliff, he somehow gets up, overriding the death program, and kills Healthcliff, or (5) when Kirito is facing Oberon in the final battle, Kirito is forced to lay on the ground because of a gravity ability that Oberon possesses, but somehow Heathcliff randomly appears out of nowhere to help Kirito! What the fuck! And don’t get me started with the fanservice, is adding in tentacles and attempted rape necessary? I don’t think so! And, worst of all, Asuna, a great fighter, is somehow reduced to being a damsel in distress. I understand that she’s 1 out of 300 people that are still trapped in the virtual world. But, still, the execution to make Kirito jump back into the virtual world is poor.”
John shakes his head and says, “I must say, that was quite a rant. However, there are several things that you are mistaken: (1) in episode 14, Kirito manages override the death program because he was revived by Klein’s Revive Crystal, (2) Kirito’s dual-wielding ability wasn’t a Deus Ex Machina, it was given to him because he had the 'fastest reaction’, and (3) if you want to learn more about the game mechanics and the world, then read the light novels.”
Ben yells, “You...are terribly mistaken, not I! First, even if Klein did revive Kirito, why wasn’t this moment shown in the episode? Are we, the viewers, left to assume that Klein activated this crystal without the viewer’s knowledge? If that’s the case, then that is a very stupid decision by the director or producer. Second, okay, so Kirito gained this dual-wielding ability for some unknown reason, but later towards the end of the first arc, the villains explains to the viewers that this ability is given to Kirito because he has the ‘fastest reaction.’ How convenient! So, we now understand the reasons, for why Kirito gained this ability, however, the time when it was activated, gave the impression that it was a random power-up. Third, I shouldn’t read the light novel in order to understand the anime. The anime should stand apart from it.”
“Fuck you,” John shouted. “This is getting nowhere! Alex, what do you think? Is SAO one of the best or one of the worse?""
Alex scratched his head, and sighs. He said, “To be honest, I disagree with both you and Ben. SAO is just an average series. Though, I agree with John on two points: (1) the premise is, again, intriguing and draws the viewers’ interest, and (2) the art and sound for this anime is pretty good. Now, concerning story and character, there are several points from both John and Ben, that I believe is correct. However, the real problem about this show, isn’t its characters or its storyline, but the pacing and writing! Both these issues is what creates bad characters and terrible storylines. SAO could have been a fantastic series had it extended its SAO arc a bit longer, added more characterization and depth, removed the fanservice parts/incest subplot, removed ALO entirely or changed its direction, and had a more defined villain. For all these points, I believe SAO is an average series.”
“Fuck, that,” Ben yelled. “John, I know you are new to anime, but this is a new low. You will eventually realize how wrong you are. And, if you don’t change, then I’ll have to consider you as a scrub. As for Alex, man, you don’t know what you are talking about! How can you not see shit, when you see it!”
John glared at Ben and said, “Fuck you and you cocky attitude! I won’t change my opinion, just because you’ll call me a scrub. I should be able to enjoy whatever I view without getting bashed for it! But, if you’re going to continue bashing me and calling me names, then this friendship is over.""
Ben replied, “Fine by me, asshole. Your opinions were always stupid to begin with.
“Fuck you,” said Ben. “I’m leaving.""
John got up from the chair, and exited from Ben’s room. Alex became silent, he couldn’t believe that this was the end of their friendship. He thought, “Is arguing over whether an anime was the best or the worst, really worth the cost of a friend?” 
He knew the answer. But, he was unable to bring himself to admit it.
The End.",5

                Just one guy's review. 
Story: There was so much potential for Sword Art Online to be something special. In the end. It's just a bland romance anime. SWO and ALO are never explained in detail and they're unjustly random settings. Story? Simply boy who had little social skills meets girl and they fall in love. That's it! What really drives me mad is how there's barely any characters or great character interactions! No teamwork, Kirito essentially does everything himself and he's just Over Powered for no reason. 
Art: It's mediocre at best. Yeah, there's a difference in art styles when they go into the VRMMOs,
                  but the difference is really slight. 
Sound: Opening and ending theme are catchy enough. The music is probably the show's strongest point.
Character: Both Kirito and Asuna are just plain boring. They're strong from the start so you never see any growth in their skills. The only growth we get is the lame boy with no social skills suddenly gets a ton of girls liking him >. > Klien is the comic relief character, but he gets no spotlight and every other character is literally just there without any purpose. Even the villains fall short of loving to hate them. Every character is just there!
Enjoyment: I watched the first few episodes expecting this to be really good. I realized as the show got on that it just was not my cup of tea. Still, I finished all 25 episodes out of obligation for the time investment. I have to say this is easily one of the biggest disappointments for me. I was expecting an awesome Virtual Reality world anime that would focus on the environment and perhaps have a sense of teamwork since it is a MMO... but no... we just get essentially Twilight in the world of Dot Hack. Better yet, once ALO starts we completely lose fighting monsters! I get it, there's so much more content in the light novels and it can only get better.  People love the series so I'll give the show its credit, but I was completely misled by the whole premise of the story. So much potential wasted.
Overall: 3.6/10 Poor.",3

                First of all: I effing hate the anime adaptation.
Now onto the review (ranting). 
This one of the adaptation with lots of fanboy (me), fangirls, and a lot of ranting in forums. Many screams of happiness when the news of the adaptation was confirmed, and several has already believed SAO's anime will be one of the best anime that season.
Turns out it's not.
SAO is the anime adaptation of a series of light novels of the same name by Reki Kawahara, with an amazing amount of hype (not without reeason for the novel). It is set on 2022, where humanity has finally for the first time able
                  to completely go inside the game world using virtual reality technology. 
It's pretty mainstream since real life MMORPG genre has quite lots of works, for example .hack G.U. or Yureka. But this one gave with a tint taste of darkness; Death is real here. Death in the game is equal with death in real life. A promising premise.
It's too bad that A-1 Pictures went retard with their adaptations (as usual). SAO kickstart with a somewhat promising and fulfilling first episodes. But they went idiot for following episodes. I have read the original source material, the light novels. So I'm going with a lot of ranting and comparison between them.
SAO doubtlessy has a promising and quite original premise, like I said, and the light novel fully uses the premise to maximum and gave me a very good reading of a series. The anime, however, totally ruins what the novel has managed to reach. At start we were given a large number of VRMMORPG player who were the first to taste the very first virtual reality game, but they were given a merciless truth about the death factor of a game. The anime managed to adapt the initial sequence for the story rather well. However, A-1 Pictures managed burn the rest of the episodes and the potential of this anime as well. 
Here's the list of what made the adaptation an epic failure:. 
In the first 7 episodes, what started as a merciless game of death was turned into a get-all-the-girls-you-met story. I mean, goddammit, they turn the starting arc into a freaking harem episodes. Yeas, those girls are cute; yes, we are oh so very thankful for the fanservices. Not. These are the goddamn side stories, why the hell would they put it in the initial start? They are side stories, they are not meant to be a major plot points. And the studio didn't give a good job at it. They reduced (massively) and changed the dialogue and event sequence, making it felt awkward and felt like a damn cheesy soap opera.
When the arc finally back on the death game aspect, it fell into the pit of doom further by putting the cheesy romance aspect as the main focus. Some people love romance, hell, I love romance, but only when they are given naturally and within reason. The studio throws away the world building aspect, it throws away the dungeon exploration, and they gave off the main couples in ultimate lovey-dovey mode. The light novel gave the readers a healthy portion of each aspect with the right and natural course of event, while the anime just do a copy pasta, throw away an amount of important ones and focusing on to the romance instead. And they didnt even do a good job at it! Once again, they totally reduced the important sequence of event and cutting lots of plot, making them a rushed and forced storytelling.
The second arc is as much of a disappointment, if not more.
The second arc was done in ALfheim Online (ALO), a second generation major VRMMORPG after SAO. In here, A-1 Pictures gave us not only a cut down and reduced version of an adaptation but also adding several stuffs that once again was done poorly. They completely ruins the supposedly touching events in the light novel considering the new character in ALO: the little sister.  
This is where my hatred reached its peak. (Bit of spoiler ahead). The reduced and cut down adaptation was executed very poorly, they skip and skip and skip events that tie down the major plot together and ruins it as a whole. 'Oh, since we need to appease our customers further, why dont we add lots and lots of unnatural fanservice? And let's not give a damn about the storytelling!' Screw them. They made what is a story about reaching the impossible into a forced and unnatural story. And what's up with the eye candies!? God, just what the hell were the studios thinking? You want to make this into a low-budget ecchi anime?
The event considering the little sister is an event of of despairing, heartbreaking moment of revelation in the light novel. But, noooooo, the studio just had to make it damn predictable and shallow kind of event. The light novel made me feel what and how the little sister felt, how their problem and misunderstanding almost destroy the siblings' relationship. The anime made me feel like watching a dirt.
Next is the total ruination of the characters. Focusing too the romance aspect in the first half making the focus of the character is only at our main couple making the side charas even more sidelined. And that's it. The studio is practically saying ""Screw the other charas, let's not pay much attention on them. Let's instead give a full throttle screen time on the main couple!!"" All the heart-wrenching moment between characters was made into a superficial relationship into a big amount of cheesy lines.
Let's rant about the animation now.
In terms of background visual, they did an admittedly wonderful job. The background was a sight to behold, and they made a change to the ALO game focus, the Yggdrasil, which I like. The action animation part, on the other hand, is a disappointment. They made a lot of important action a still picture animation, with only adding sound effects and vibrating effects. All the actually moving animation is pretty average. They didnt give their all at all in the animation.
The music is one that's done in a very fulfilling result, IMO, considering the one who compose them is Kajiura Yuki. But when it comes to it, there's actually only one BGM that's memorable, the battle BGM 'Swordland'. The OP and ED was not bad, especially the first OP and the second ED.
To conclude this review in a sentence: Screw you, A-1 Pictures. You destroyed what big potential SAO light novel has in the poorly executed dirtbag you made and called it adaptation. This adaptation is a major failure and disappointment for most of the LN fans. Not only it crushes our anticipation, it also gave a bad mindset to those who have yet to read the original light novel, and in some casesit even made some of those who actually read them the anime impression when they read the novel, making them dropped the series. With all of my subjectivity, I gave the anime 3/10. And that was being kind. This is not an adaptation, this is a cutdown copypasta of the LN. They could've made this a movie adaptation for the first volume, a series of OVAs for the second volume, and another movie adaptations for each following arc of the light novel. They could've pour a lot more budget it it's a movie adaptation, and gained a comeback from amounts of BD sales, buuyed by satisfied costumers and fans. Instead thay made this dirtbag.
If a second season was made, I can only hope a different studio handle it, one that was less retard then A-1 Pictures.",3
"
                Sword Art Online. Reviewing this anime is one of the harder things in life but we'll get there hopefully.
Story 4/10
The story is about a boy called Kazuto Kirigaya who enters Sword art online, a VRMMORPG. 
The story is split up in two arcs, Aincrad and Fairy Dance arc.  Both Arcs have 12 episodes. 
The anime starts out pretty good, an interesting premise. That being said they poorly executed the story. The time skips are just painful to see, because you have this great world to work with and you skip large parts of it. Almost everything was rushed, they didn't even give the time
                  to flesh out the world.  At the end of the first arc, it pulls out a Deus ex machina, just so that it doesn't end in Aincrad. The second half is our hero Kazuto trying to rescue Asuna. He instantly jumps in another VRMMORPG because being stuck 2 years in a game isn't enough and the anime ends. 
Art: 7/10 Sound: 7/10
The art is awesome. 
The soundtrack is awesome.
Awesome boss battles and the animation make every boss battle delightful to watch, honestly I needed more of this combined with the OST. Honestly this is the only redeemable quality of Sword Art Online, it can take pride in its soundtrack and animation. The sound effects were super. 
Character 3/10
The characters in SAO are dreadful. There is nothing to say, Asuna goes from the heroine to the damsel in distress tsundere, Kirito is a walking chick magnet, the other female characters are just there to fit in Kirito's harem. Really I could just scream, every character got 1 episode of screen time and instantly falls in love with our hero Kirito. It becomes painful to watch at one point. There is almost no character development, the second half becomes laughable. Asuna becomes even more a damsel in distress and Kirito is there just to save the day.
Enjoyment 4/10
Was the first half enjoyable? Yes, the epic boss battles and soundtrack made me stick around to the end. The world setting is great, and honestly if they spend 25 episodes in Aincrad it would've turned out better then it is now.
Did the second half choke the first half? Yep, the second half made those 12 episodes seem meaningless, I just wanted to stop at one point. Episode 22? I was laughing, can't take this seriously anymore. However the good moments in the anime were enjoyable, this anime could have been much more.
Overall 4/10
You might want skip this one or watch until episode 12.",4
"
                This anime is a lot like Mirai Nikki, in the way that both consist of a meaningless game of life or death with the male protagonist playing along and stupidly treating human life like nothing. 
The supporting characters are interesting and entertaining, although unrealistic and artful. 
No matter what Kiriko does, no matter how stupid, he is treated with undeserved compassion.
It's like the world revolves around the protagonist, which is stupid.
The protagonist is constantly making stupid decisions, and the story has many stupid turning-points as well. The creator of the Sword Art Online game is first called a genius, yet his creation isn't based on
                  any intellectual theory and only brings about the unnecessary death of numerous innocent human beings. Furthermore, the people playing SAO are irrational and impatient and would rather risk their lives instead of leveling on lower level monsters, and the protagonist is so stupid that he can't even explain why he thinks only one person could survive a game created for thousands, and thinks it's more important to become the best at the game instead of saving human lives. Not only that, but he is praised for being this stupid.
To conclude, if you don't have a brain or like being stupid, then watch this anime and enjoy it.",5
"
                Four months ago i started watching nine seperate animes, watching about 1-3 episodes every week. I have now reached the final four episodes of each other those animes, and every night for a little over the next week, i will be concluding an anime. By a role of a dice SAO was chosen first and I am glad it was. This is an objective review of SAO from someone who knew from previous reviews that the show was not going to be the greatest anime of alltime as those that reviewed based on the first four episodes hailed it. In other words, i went in
                  having medium expectations... and im going to be honest, they were satisfied. SAO is a 25 episode anime that is ultimatly split into two different parts/arcs. Part one being Aincrad (technically SAO), and part two being Alfheim (technically fairy land). Both of these arcs are completely different, with part 1 focusing more on characters adjusting to life in a new setting and forming true relationships (ultimately limiting the action after episode 3), part two for the most part is just straight out action and suspense, completly throwing the whole point of part 1, which was adjusting to a new setting, out a window. with that said i enjoyed both parts in their own specific way.
Characters: 4
Ok i am going to be frank here, compared to the eight other animes that i will be writting about this upcoming week, the overall main cast in this show is incredibly week.
Kirito/Kazuto- The main character of SAO is, surprise surprise, your generic male protagonist with all of the trimmings. Seemingly stronger than every character in anime. Manages to attract the love of every female character he meets, and has ultimately no bad traits or emotions what so ever. Seriously, the producers succeeded in making this guy so generic that i actually cant criticize them. This was obviously there goal and they succeeded. They gave him a minimal backstory with minutes of flashbacks, and blatantly made it clear that this is just ur generic protagonist. Goal succeed. He did not help yet the anime.
Asuna- Main heroine for part 1 of SAO. Very controversial character in the sense that you either love her as a string heroine (for the first half of the story atleast), or you find her incredibly annoying due to her constant nagging (that also end though at the end of the first half). Minor spoiler here but she becomes a supporting character in the second part of SAO. Don't get me wrong, you still see her... for about 20 minutes in part 2, and she still has a huge effect on the story, but any characterization given to her in part one of SAO goes down the drain in part 2.
Leafa/Suguha- Main heroine for part 2. Probably the only dynamic character in the story. Don't get me wrong, she is horrifically annoying in her first 3 episodes, but she really does change into a strong, very dynamic character. Some minor spoilers here (i really cant describe her without giving away some minor stuff), allthough the characters wont figuere it out till the end, it is revealed almost right away that Leafa is Suguha, Kirito's sister. Which creates a really intriguing relationship. I gotta give the produvcers credit for that, very original and i actually like how it played out.
Story for part 1: 9
Action for part 1: 6
Story for part 2: 7
Action for Part 2: 9
SAO was primarily advertised as an anime that would involve characters having to adapt to life in a virtual world, as well as provide an equal amount of action. Notice the word equal, it never was equal.
Part 1: The story for the first part of SAO basically delivers what you were promised. The aspects of players being forced to adapt in a virtual world. However, the action completely subsides after episode 3, and while some of the side stories were decent, i found the timeflow to be horrifically fast paced and to many extents just rushed. For a setting where everyone is connected, you would see a character once, and if they were lucky you would see them for maybe 5 more minutes after that episode. With that being said, there were two episodes in this arc (after episodes 1-3) that completely stood out as episodes that easily lived up to the hype that the general public had originally set. Those episodes were episodes 10 and 14. Episode 10 virtually came out of no where compeltly suprised me, and episode 14 was the midseason finale (end of part 1). Both of these episodes were well written and if the rest of the first part was written like those two episodes, this anime would easily be a 10, but its not because episodes 4-9 and 11-12 virtually ignore every aspect of action and several episodes throw poor plots at the viewer. Such as two teenagers awkwardly becoming the parents of a computer program. You know there is that movie ""her"" coming out which focuses on some loser falling in love with his cell phone. (surprisingly wasnt that bad) I am convinced they stole that part from SAO because Kirito and Asuna literally develop a parental relationship with a computer program.  
Part 2: A lot more easier to describe with minor spoilers. Asuna is kidnapped. Kirito must save her. Leifa and the computer program accompany Kirito, abandoning virtually every supporting character made in SAO. The plot is extremely random and you will not be able to predict a single episode.While it may seem like im severely criticzing this arc, i actually found the suspense to be queite enjoyable. While the plot of the first arc was a lot more complex and what the producers had promised us, i found myself more compelled to watch the next episode at the conclusion of each episode in this arc. Along with that i did appreciate the fact that this arc had a clear main antagonist, and i enjoyed his crazyness. 
The ""controversial"" final episode (very minor spoilers so don't worry)- A lot of people bashed episode 25, the finale. Those people could please shut up. The true, brutal, climax and ultimate ending of SAO is episode 24. Episode 25 is an aftermath episode. Episode 24 is the big memorable episode and is the ultimate end to the series. Episode 25 is the epilogue, i don't get what the problem is. There is nothing bizarre about it. The producers just wanted to use a whole episode to make closure, rather than just giving closure in the final 5 minutes of the show. I appreciated this primarily due to the fact that episode 24 was written quite well.
Art: 10
Exceptional Art. While i will start setting my expectations alot higher for 2014 animes (as i now expect every anime to create art that is a 10), i found some of the visuals to be stunning.
Sound: 10
Just like the art, i found that voiceovers to be exceptional. 
Overall: There are definitely alot of pros and cons and after finishing the whole anime i can honestly say that you should watch this. The only reason why i am saying should and not have to is due to the fact that its polar opposite 2013 counterpart, Log Horizon (same virtual reality setting but features politcs instead of action) has impressed me alot more especially with its characters. With that said i found this to be extremely enjoyable. It just a good chunk of the episodes arent particularly memorable.  I would rate this slightly above an 8, and in tterms of letter grades would give it a B+.
Top 5 Episodes: 
5- Episode 20
4- Episode 3
3- Episode 10
2- Episode 24
1- Episode 14
Animes that will be completed and reviewed in the upcoming week:
Tomorrow- Tokyo Magnitude 8.0
Following Tokyo Magnitude will be Eureka 7: AO
Then Elfen Lied
Following that will be K- Project
Then Another
Then Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor 
And finishing the eight days off is Fate/Zero ( i have seen the first 21 episodes and it has blown me away, so baring a bad ending, expect praise for Fate Zero)
Thank you and I hope you enjoyed this review",8

                Sword Art Online was, no doubt, the most hyped-up anime of 2012. It did live up to the hype in some ways through its amazing animation and gorgeous RPG fight scenes and its unique setup that would interest the wide amount of anime fans who are also gamers. I don’t think SAO is amazing, and it’s not one of my favorites, but I did enjoy it.
I first started watching SAO in my anime club and I quickly got hooked on it from the first five episodes. After that, watching a couple episodes every week until I finally decided to catch up was really enjoyable for
                  me. The problem came when I caught up, as the series had 17 episodes out at that time. I enjoyed the first half of SAO much more. I had no problem with the new characters in the second half, I just really missed Asuna and Kirito’s relationship that they had been developing in the first half, though I didn’t like the perverted villain.
The story of SAO is great. It has one of the best and most creative setups I’ve ever seen and I was really interested to see where they took this show. At first, all of the video game players are entering Sword Art Online, a new virtual reality video game which is the first of its kind. Seems normal enough: everyone’s going around doing normal RPG things, learning the basics, guys are mingling with other guys disguised as girls because it’s a video game and that kind of stuff happens and I love that they include this. Soon, the gamers realize they cannot log out and they are teleported to an arena where a large hologram tells them that they are trapped in the game and must beat the game or die trying. That’s pretty intense, and while it seems like it could be fun for anime fans watching this thinking their life is boring, really that would scary as hell. Kirito, having already been a beta tester for the game, gets a head start on everything soon afterwards and heads onwards with his previously acquired knowledge of the game. The first few episodes after this are just Kirito meeting other people (mostly girls of course, this is an anime) who he has different experiences with in different aspects of the game from fighting murderous guilds to making weapons to joining a guild. Around episode 5 or 6 is where Asuna becomes a main character and the show starts to focus on her and Kirito. This brings in one of my problems with this show. Sword Art Online introduces many characters in the first few episodes, and then just discards them when they’re done with them. There are many characters that you see in the first few episodes that won’ ever be seen again until the last scene of the show and by then and the fact that they don’t look the same, it’s practically impossible to remember a few of them but they act like they’re all best friends with Kirito. I liked all of the characters, but I just wish SAO hadn’t thrown them away so quickly, and I wish they could have at least come back for some of the later boss fights. I’ll stop the story here to avoid spoilers.
Sword Art Online is one of the most visually astounding masterpieces I have ever watched. It may have many faults, but there are almost none when it comes to the beautiful RPG scenery and epic battles that this show has. In fantasy shows, one of the most important things is to set up the world your show is taking place in, and SAO definitely does that perfectly throughout the whole show. The music that goes with everything is brilliant too and the music in the boss fights is different every time (I think, I could be wrong though) and helps to set a different mood for each one, since they really are different. Going back to the story a bit, the boss fight are never just “Let’s kill this beast to get to the next floor” it always has something much bigger to it. The drama they build up around these fights helps to make them one of the highlights of this show, and the music really helps build up that drama even before the fight starts.
I do like the characters a lot in SAO. I’ve heard many people don’t like Kirito, but I do, though it’s not like he’s one of my favorite characters. I loved his relationship with Asuna, because unlike most romance animes, they don’t just screw around the whole time trying to hide their emotions and not kiss until the last half of the last episode. But, as I said before, I didn’t like how they put this on hold in the second half of the show. Asuna is also a great character. Tsunderes aren’t anything new in anime, but Asuna is much more than a generic tsundere (as shown by my last statement that they don’t wait until the last episode). Plus, she’s just as good of a fighter as Kirito. I won’t explain the other characters, because, either they’re dropped after episode 5 only to make one or two reappearances, or they aren’t introduced until the second half which would spoil things.
I do like SAO a lot, though I don’t think it lived up to the hype (though with hype that big what could?). If you’re a gamer, well you probably already have seen this anime, and if not you definitely should see it. I recommend this show to every fan whether you’re a gamer or not. It’s just one of those shows you have to see or at least try.

                [Minor spoilers ahead including few scenes that are taken out and don't matter much to the overall experience]
- Every now and then we get a new series with a cool premise that sweeps off the audience and boosts its way to the very top. Such was the case with Naruto when it first aired and it is still, probably, the first Anime any inexperienced Anime viewer watches as he enters the animal world. 
The case is pretty much the same with Sword art Online. Concept, idea and premise of the show were great; they were promising, indulging and above all, I thought I'd finally find
                  a jewel in a pile of crap when it came to this type of genre - oh boy was I wrong. 
- Any gamer's dream, a virtual machine which allows you to visualize yourself in a place of your character in a vast world and experience the adventure first hand came forward in this anime. I was excited; I wanted to see what it'd be like if I were to be one of those people. However, the story falls short and flat-executed almost at the very beginning. Considering the amount of time skips (one or two are variable, but you have to know the limits), you're basically sprung over the countless points in the world which are never explained and you simply can't attach yourself to anything that's happening on the screen. The story basically follows Kirito, an online gamer throughout his journey. The story is fairly simple; it's basically any survival horror set in a wide-ranged world with countless possibilities. How can it fall flat then? With such variety of possibilities, I couldn't even think of the Anime failing - but, unfortunately, it did. As the show progresses, the story keeps making less and less sense than it previously did. All the little details suddenly contribute to the story but all in the wrong way. Hacking ability appears just when it's needed without previous mentioning of it and then it disappears as it never existed and all of these other plot holes that make the story simply ... blank. 
Another bad aspect of the Sword art Online are the characters; don't get me wrong, there is development - it's just that we don't see it. Most of the time characters ""grow"" or ""develop"" is during those time skips. We see that they've changed and developed, but we don't know why and how. Time skips are fine when it's a long ongoing series and it began falling and slows  so writer needs to fasten it up a little bit, change the world so that the viewers won't lose interest. However, it doesn't work in a 25 episodes show. And romances ... oh the romances. I've actually read that Kirito and Asuna are the best possible couple ever created - no! Aside of Asuna, there are also some minor other characters but who can really take two teenagers in love seriously? And they're not even out-going teenagers but rather that period when the puberty just starts to kick in. It's obvious that the writers wanted this show's strength to lay on impact during the death of those characters, but that simply doesn't work because the moments are far out of the place and they're far too dramatic - they simply try too hard. Other than two main characters, there are also a few others that get developed but, again, it's during those annoying time skips. All in all, characters at the end simply fell flat and rushed even though they had a great time to get developed even without the time skips. I'd rather have a full-blown season of, let's say, first 20 levels in the game where the characters are actually developed, and then the second season with a time skip to catch up a little bit and fasten it up. This way, the characters, even though interesting at times, simply fall flat at the end. 
When it comes to art and sound, I think that these are the best aspects of the Anime for sure. Art is above decent; it's colorful, even beautiful at times, but it's also repetitive, the characters look as if they've been drawn from one shape with just different eyes and hair (even Kirito and Asuna look like a brother and sister) but it really has some great moments. The fights are decently animated, there are some great effects but the usage of a CGI felt vaguely out of the place. When it comes to the sound score, anime has solid background music but what impressed me the most was the voice acting. Trust me, it's nothing mind-blowing, but it's believable and the dialogue (which, by the way, isn't something you will remember) was delivered with a sense of reality. 
I'm really picky when it comes to the fantasy genre; I was excited about this anime but, at the end, it simply failed to amuse me. The first half was decent; it was watchable and it had its fun moments, but then it simply got lost trying to be too many things at the time. Trying to be funny, sad, full of action, dramatic, beautiful ... and, at the end, it wasn't anything really. 
I'll admit that some fights were actually intense and you never knew who's going to die but, at the end, you really didn't care because you didn't know the characters that well. One moment, however, stuck in my head and it was quite funny; when Kirito and Asuna were in that cabin in some sort of lower-level stage and Kirito suggested that they sleep together which Asuna misunderstands and gets half naked. Other than that, I barely remember much from this show other than some mayor plot holes which I won't mention since it would've spoiled too much of the series.
All in all, anime full of potential that simply failed to deliver - it should be a example that trying to be too many stuff at the same time doesn't work as intended.",4

                This is less of a review and more of an opinionated expression of mine. 
Lambasted, skewered, and negatively criticized for being unable to achieve and fulfil the expectations of many of its viewers, SAO, had unassailably deserved being done so. The major flaws are undeniably obtrusive and, of course, had been highlighted by many reviews that I’ve come across. But I must say a word of fairness here, the reason why people have been so objectively criticizing SAO is because of their expectations. We expected many and we received little and thus the controversy. 
Before SAO was airing, thousands and thousands have been anticipating the
                  series, knowing that this is the next big thing; no doubt.  We expect it to be good, plot wise, character wise, and so on. Then a couple of episodes were aired, and I must say, it was entertaining. But then as the story goes on, it turns out to be detached, plot wise and character wise. It then goes on to be, to some extent, episodic. The second half of the series was desperation at its worst. It attempts to include a character of a significant role and expectedly failed due to the lack of a stable groundwork of the first half of the series. The emotions were artificially drawn on the facade of the characters, as there are no genuine inner emotions that were being stirred. Despite its flaws, it has been entertaining, maybe because of the visual effects.  
Now, I’ve come across many reviews have made a point that the side characters played no part in the main plot, but why must they? It could be that the creator was focusing on the individuality of the protagonist, why must we have this thought that everyone should play a part in the main plot so that it would be complete? You might then question the purpose of side characters and their role. Let me put it this way, plot devices are meant to keep the plot going. They have a certain amount of time on screen and when the plot moves on, they probably will not appear again. The only difference of the utilization of plot devices by SAO and other anime is the amount of time given to them. But, I must admit that by giving the side characters such a pitiful amount of time has left a lot to be desired. 
Still, SAO have many deplorable shortcomings, such as the protagonist, who is a few inches away from perfection. Suave looking, undefeatable, intellectual, spontaneous; seriously, what more can you ask for? But to have such a character in the story means a formulaic plot. In some way, the protagonist was a selling point as well. There is a good portion of people that fantasizes about such a character; flawless, compassionate, and so on. I wouldn’t want to even mention that such a character would also affect the realism of the series, since SAO is a futuristic gaming series.
Anyways, let’s look at what SAO has achieved. If you have noticed, SAO has done quite a bit in making sure that the protagonists are three-dimensional. They are well-developed, but many don’t feel that way because we have the thought of him, being perfect, in our mind. So this is actually, in some way, very contradicting. The effort exerted has no effect whatsoever. 
To sum all this up, the downfall of SAO is that many viewers are unable to follow the logic of the progression of plot. Many of what have been attempted seems pointless because at most of the time, it negates its own attraction. But somehow, it has been entertaining. Maybe it’s just like reading a fairy tale, always nice to have protagonist of near perfection every once in a while.",7

                Barely any spoilers ahead, I kept the review short and clean. Sorry for grammar mistakes.
With my first review I felt like I'm being too generous.
I had to choose overall score and 3 was the best way to describe Sword Art Online, its poor, nothing more, nothing less.
Story was dreadful, 2.
The story was lackluster and changes pacing and genre every 2 episodes so there's not much of a story going on and you feel you're watching extras of a actual series.
The premise is interesting though.
Art was good, 7.
Art and sound are the best things going on in this series, the battles are flashy and awesome but
                  some episodes have noticeably worse animation but in general is good.
Sound was fair, 6.
I'm giving a 6 because sound was admittedly OK and fits every scene but I forgot about each and every one of the openings for some reason. All I remember is that the second season's opening is horrible.
Characters are pathetic, 1.
Here is possibly the worst part of the anime, the protagonist is incredibly overpowered, the main character's love interest is introduced as a strong independent female but ends up being literally useless.
Both antagonists are interestingly bad; the first one is a ""mysterious"" figure who is never explained in the anime and the second one is too evil that its hard to take seriously.
The villain of second season is literally a demon from hell playing a character, its too evil and like the protagonist has 0 charisma whatsoever.
Also be prepared for characters to be introduced in a episode to die on the same episode or disappear for no reason.
Enjoyment was dreadful, 2.
I did not enjoy this anime at all, it made me feel uncomfortable with several scenes, was bland and boring and did not portray MMOs in a correct way.
Final Score is 3.
I can't recommend to anyone this anime, go watch Log Horizon if you came here for the MMO aspect of this anime.",3

                Sword Art Online. I'm sure you all know about it by this point, so I'm not going to go into any details about it so as to familiarize you with it like I would most other anime I would write about. By far the most popular title in 2012, if not the past 5 or 6 years. I've talked to many of my NON-anime watching friends who tell me they have seen SAO. Of course with this kind of popularity usually comes extreme opinions, and SAO is no exception. In fact, I think SAO is a great exhibit that can be used to showcase the
                  anime community and what they have become.
Sword Art Online is such an extreme example of diverging opinions that you almost never see people rating it anything between 4-9, it's always 10, 10, 2, 1, 3, 10, 2, 1, 1, 1... etc. For some reason, all those who would normally give it a mediocre rating, instead decide that they hate the show. Why? Because so many other people love it, and they can't comprehend that. They then notice that many of the people who love it are those also love Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, and other mainstream anime. SAO then gets branded as a mainstream anime, and gets shit from a whole chunk of the community. They go into it with a closed mind, and after coming out they only see what they expect to see and proceed to rant about how terrible every single aspect of the show is. And such are the ways of the anime community, which unfortunately in everywhere except Japan, seems to follow whatever ideology /a/ tells them to.
In case you haven't realized, I am of neither factions. I am neither a rabid fanboy, nor someone who thinks the show is absolute shit for no justified reason. I think it is, at best, mediocre. I also think, at worst, it is mediocre. To me, this anime represents a couple things: a) It epitomizes mediocrity, and b) The convoluted demographic anime is now aiming for. There is nothing particularly good about it, but on the flip-side, there's nothing particularly bad. The story is kind of well written, but has many flaws. The characters are for the most part pretty flawed and poorly written, but not so much that it detracts from the show. They certainly don't add anything, but they don't detract either. The art looks quite nice; some of the landscapes are beautiful. However, I felt that the action sequences left some to be desired. I would like to say that the sound was great, as it featured some solid voice acting along with an OST composed by Kajiura Yuki (!!!), yet there was nothing for Kajiura's tracks to highlight, and none of them stuck out particularly. So while the sound helped set the overall tone of the anime, much like the rest of the show, nothing stood out.
Yet, with all that being said, without question, it is an enjoyable watch. For those of you debating whether or not to watch it, I'd suggest watching the first few episodes and then deciding if you'd want to continue. I realize that this is what most people will suggest when watching ANY anime, but for many shows the first couple episodes might not give you enough. You might end up dropping a show that could have become your favorite. A personal example for me would be Shinsekai Yori. Honestly, I found the first couple episodes kinda boring, and forgot to watch the next couple. It was only when I picked it back up on a whim a few weeks later did I realize that this was something more than what I had thought it was. Shinsekai Yori is now one of my favorite anime, but if I were to have done the ""3 episode trial"" with it, I probably never would have finished it. With SAO, this is not the case. The first 3 episodes are a wonderful example of what is to come in the rest of the series, as there is never really anything more than those three episodes, but nothing much less either.
SAO is split up into two overriding arcs, each taking place in two different video games. Sword Art Online, and Alfheim Online respectively. Many people bicker about which arc was better, so I'll share my thoughts on this as well. I thought the first arc, SAO, was much better than the second arc. It wasn't really as much about what the first arc did right, but more what the second arc did wrong. The plot for the second arc seemed to be mainly be a feeble excuse to get them back in some different game. While the plot for the first arc seemed to be relevant and remained interesting throughout, the second arc seemed to be mostly a rehash, where everything that made the first arc work taken out. Without the plot points that made SAO work, they had to create new ones. And so a much more superficial plot was created, complete with some good ol' cousinly incest. For the most part, the second arc just bugged me. It however, through some miraculous force of will, remained entertaining.
The last thing I want to leave you with is the thought that when it all boils down, all you're doing is watching a 16 year old kid play video games. Honestly, you can do that on youtube so much more easily, and instead of 25 episodes there are tens of thousands. I personally don't enjoy watching people play video games, so my enjoyment of the show was cut a bit as a result. If I were rating this on a bell curve (Which I normally don't, but for the sake of this review, I will), I'd give SAO a 5/10. Not a particularly great story, feeble characters, relatively nice art, and one of Kajiura's poorer works. Yet all together, somehow creates something of an enjoyable experience.
tl;dr SAO was okay, and people need to learn to calm their tits. 5/10",5

                Spoilers will happen in every review and I'm not gonna bother to reign my use of them. 
Ever wondered what's the best comedy anime of all time? Look no further; Sword Art Online is here!
Sword Art Online's entire existence itself is a joke to begin with. Most animes in the comedy genre follow a fixed set of jokes (or slight variations of them) and instead of appearing funny they just end up being flat these days. Sword Art Online, however, is an undeniable diamond in the rough and you will have a BLAST with the stunning cringe humor this stellar anime provides; only rivalled by
                  gundam seed destiny
Let's start with the story. The story itself takes place in a MMORPG setting where the most hyped title of the NotOculusRift console, ""Sword art online"" is released. Players then enter the world and on the first day, are horrified that they're trapped inside. The story then follows protagonist Kirigaya Kazuto (IGN: Xx_KiritoMLG_xX) oin his goal to be accepted by FaZe clan and be the best swordscoper in an effort to clear the game and thus unshackle everybody who got trapped in this digital realm. The fact that people think this is original provides enough laughs for everybody to indulge in, but the true punch is when they start grand and promising and just fall flat after Illfang the kobold lord. Everything from there destroys characters and kisses any form of promise goodbye and the resulting catastrophe is nothing but priceless.
If you think that's amazing, the second half delivers EVEN BETTER. A new villain is introduced and is portrayed as a huge pervert (Gotta make that guy my best friend, man.), followed by a useless conflict that shoots giggles at you and lastly a love triangle that is not like the others, and that just isn't the same.
The characters are a whole new realm of comedy. The protagonist, Kirito is in a league of his own. He's set to unreasonably be the best in everything and even charm all the girls despite being labelled as antisocial as what the first episode seems to portray and the huge character discrepancy is nothing short of lulzy. Even in re-watches (realtalk why) I never fail to burst into laughter with his antics. The supporting cast of girls and shoved-aside guys are also vital to the show's humor value. Powerful gag engines such as Asuna, Silica and Lisbeth will have you rolling in your grave as they start strong and independent only to fall victim and play damsel in distress in a series of bad cliches. Of course, the amazing Suguha also brings harsh competition into the playing field of SAO's championed humor game with her forced one-sided incestual love that she justifies with ""We're only cousins!"". Timeless joke, guys.
The Art is unparalleled in fight scenes and never lose steam; especially in the ALO arc where everything grew fucking wings and never fails to hit your laughboxes. (Realtalk again the artstyle is kinda bland but that LOLs too mirite) (no but yeah the fightscenes make up for it but even then the ALO ones suck)
The sound starts with a powerful cast of one by LiSA; ""crossing field"" and Yume sekai by Tomatsu haruka. While nothing to laugh about these two songs are really pleasing to the ears. (forreal). But then we transition Sword art online's second OP and ED which I will not name because I don't deserve to be graced with such an opportunity when it comes to a hilariously bad transition of opening and ending. The overall music quality stays rather enjoyable and is a nice touch while you're busy LMFAOing.
This whole show is a joke and you have no reason not to enjoy it; easy 10/10.
To all my audience; what are you waiting for?! Explore this gem hated by one too many and be enthralled by the laughs it graces you with!",10
"
                I enjoyed SAO But it is far from perfect. 
As someone who pays a lot of games i found it quite easy to relate to, comparing elements of SAO to other games, but the show has a lot of inconsistencies and sometimes breaks its own rules
The story is alright, the world created is very interesting but i don't thin it was explored enough, I would have thought higher of the series had it end on episode 15 rather than adding the alfhiem arc.
The music isn't all too memorable but does its job well.
As far as the characters go most of them are likable but short
                  lived, Kirito is unrealistically powerful, even if he is a ""beater,"" However i overlooked this through most of the series. Some of the characters should have been explored further, Lisabeth especially.
Some of the shorter stories told within the years that passed during the anime come across short, it was difficult to empathize at parts as the characters were only introduced the episode prior. Their deaths may have been impact to Kirito but to me as a viewer I'd barely seen them.
This is My first review! i hope to write more, in future they will hopefully be more positive",7
"
                This is just one of those animes I have to split up into separate reviews in one because it is the only way I can address what I liked and disliked about it.
The first half of SAO Episodes 1 - 14
Although a friend recommended this anime to me I still kept putting it off for a bit because I didn't know if I would like the concept of the whole ""virtual world made real"" but after watching some episodes of Log Horizon and liking it i decided to give SAO a chance. Afterall, SAO is said to be the more ""hardcore"" anime compared to Log
                  Horizon. The first episode really got me hooked. I liked how every reacted to the news that they would be trapped inside the game with a real death penalty. The main villain was set up quite nicely and I loved how the main character, Kirito, wasn't the cookie cutter ""save everybody!"" type. Of course this changed as the story progressed after Kirito watches his entire guild die on him. But even so I still think the characters stood on their own. I love that a weak player like Klein didn't just up and die simply because he wasn't under the uber umbrella of protection from Kirito.
I like how strong Asuna was, how she stood on equal ground with Kirito and even saved him, a far cry from most anime girls who are just there to show boobs, cry for the main character, fawn over him, and sit around needing to be saved. I also liked the development of the romance between her and Kirito and I'm glad they didn't pull the whole asexual romance thing. Like the characters like each other but never breathe a word of it ....EVER! In this anime they actually love each other and they both know it.
My only major issue with the first half is that they wrapped it up too fast. I suppose you can say that the story was always on a time limit because they were people trapped in a virtual world with their real bodies wasting away. But I sort of felt like the main fight with Kayaba was over too soon. 
Second half Episodes 15- 25
Now this is where things get convoluted and stupid for this anime. First Kirito and Asuna do not die despite getting killed yet everyone else dies and stays dead. I felt that it was a leap of ""anime logic"" that keeps them alive. Then they try to explain it away with villain #2 who wins the creep awards but he isn't half as interesting as Kayaba. The story tries to come up with a reason for what he's doing (keeping Asuna prisoner along with 300 other players) but the explanations males no sense at all. Like he says he's changing human emotions and this will somehow make him the God of the real world and...basically, I can't even explain it cause it was just too stupid to understand and it makes no sense how downloading these 300 brains and making them go through emotions were going to somehow make him a God. 
So anyway, Kirito must now plug himself back into a new virtual game to save Asuna from the clutches of the boring evil pervert villain. And this is where you now get to sit back and watch the creators unzip their pants and proceed to urinate a hot stinking stream all over their own project. :D
Now Kirito is in the world of fairies! Now he can fly! And instead of having any real problems or handicaps he gets to keep all of his old SAO levels for no reason! And although all his items have been removed he still has his virtual daughter's heart and she just so happens to have access to the systems that now recognizes her programming although the game is being tampered with in the same manner Kayaba did.  Kirito basically becomes the uber ""save everybody!"" character as he is super OP compared to every freaking player in the game. I know he was good in the first half but after a while you get sick of just watching the main character win everything. Which is why I liked the surprise of him losing to the Blood Oath leader (I will not spoil more for you). This second half was just ridiculous with the Kirito destroys everyone and is the God player of the world.
Asuna, what can I say about her expect express my total disappointment that everything that made her awesome in the first half was stripped from her...literally and she became nothing more than a damsel in a tower that needed to be rescued. All she does is sit around getting felt up by the perv with a fairy fetish crying for Kirito to save her. Sure they give us a token escape plan from her that ends with her in a lab getting felt up by tentacle slug monsters...which btw, why on earth were the scientists inside the VR inspecting the brains as tentacle slugs???  Naturally they want do some raping but unfortunately they have to put her back in her gilded cage.
Then we see more of Kirito's sister-cousin who...just so happens to be in love with Kirito. *eye roll* btw, what is up with all these animes and sister-cousins falling in love with their brother-cousins? Geez! Anyway, she just so happens to be playing the Elf game and runs into Kirito but doesn't know it's him even though he looks very similar to his IRL self. Anyway, all she's good for is giving us random cleavage shots and crying over Kirito. I wanted to just shout ""Get the heck over it already!"" And don't expect her to grow as a character. Even at the end she's sitting around pining over him and trying to interfere in his relationship with Asuna.
This half of the story receives the same wrap it up box treatment as OP Kirito defies all odds with the help of like two clans just to get him up to the impossible to get to castle and save Asuna from getting raped. Just when the chips are down and we're treated to a Berserk like ending Deus ex Machina aka Kayaba enters and gives Kirito super OP administer privileges to take down the boring, evil pervert villain. 
I do like that some of the conflict spills out into the real world but overall SAO turned out to be pretty disappointing as the creators really took a good premise and railroaded it into the ground. I heard they are having a season 3. Not looking forward to the adventures of OP Kirito, his virtual system access to everything daughter, and his two wives (one of them his sister-cousin).",6

                I decided to write this review to showcase my 2nd take on SAO, as I just finished binge-re-watching it to refresh my memory for the second season.  And from the 2nd viewing, my outlook has done somewhat of a 180.  I'll start off by saying the hype of this series is beyond belief.  Every time I turn around, someone at work is talking about it, or someone on the anime forums is praising it.  But I'm not entirely sure why.  Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a bad series whatsoever.  I just don't feel it's as complex and
                  epic as everyone makes it out to be.  Let me break it down a little bit.
The concept of SAO has been reused a little bit (e.g. Log Horizon, .Hack etc.), so going into it I kind of knew what to expect.  Thousands of MMORPG players are mysteriously trapped inside the host game, and have to fight their way to survive.  If they die in the game, they die in real life.  Ok, so where does SAO differentiate itself?  I feel like this series is bigger budgeted, and it started off quite well for me.  The main protagonist, Kirito is an absolute badass.  They wrote him to be like a billion times stronger than everyone else, in part due to being a beta tester of Sword Art Online.  Chaos ensues as players are told they can only get out of SAO by playing through 100 floors filled with bosses, with each floor getting more challenging.  Some players rush in blind and effectively commit suicide, while others grind until they are more prepared to fight these bosses.  I REALLY like the idea they were going for here.  That was, until the romance kicked in.
I am normally an advocate for a good love story in animes.  But the one between Kirito and Asuna sometimes doesn't even make sense.  He meets her on the first boss raid, and of course the two of them almost single-handedly beat the floor boss.  This sparks a small romance that escalates quickly about a third of the way through.  It was cheesy, unbelievable (even from an anime standpoint) and it just irked me the rest of the series.  They even have an incredibly awkward sort of ""offspring"" which I won't elaborate on for obvious spoiler reasons.  Damn it, I feel like they had an opportunity to be so gritty and dark in this show.  It almost felt like it derailed about half way through until they remembered that eventually they would like to get out of this MMO... ""Oh yeah, we were so busy acting like a cheesy married couple that we gave up and just wanted to have sex for the rest of time""  Ok, end of rant.     
The atmosphere and vibe for the first half of the story was good though, and I enjoyed ""most"" of the battle sequences Kirito and his band of players went through.  Some of the dialogue was lame at times like ""I'm gonna get you!"" or something like that... but keep in mind that these words are coming from someone who is supposedly in early high school.  I wanted to see how far they would get through the boss floors and how the battles would transpire, and I enjoyed the skill system and player interface for SAO in general.
Then came the second half.  It felt as though the story was abruptly ended, and I was kind of wondering where it would go from there.  And it made me SO SAD.  It's so hard not to disclose spoilers about what happens, so I'll say this: most of the second half wasn't even necessary.  The environment was lame, and the relations between Kirito and a certain someone he was very close to were creepy as hell.  -Sigh-, of course I understand there was fan service to be had... but again, completely unnecessary.  The second villain I felt was way better than the first though, and I loved the justice and vengeance at the end of the show.
The story of SAO was very hit and miss for me, especially the second time around.  I can understand the hype, even with the love affair between Kirito and Asuna... but it just wasn't for everyone I guess.
It's funny to think that this was the most outstanding portion of the anime for me.  As I previously stated, SAO was a big budget show, so it's only natural that the best animators and sound directors came with it.  The character designs are great, and the landscapes of the MMO were all vivid and imaginative.  The special effects were also done well, and I loved the way they made the bosses look visceral and ferocious.  Well done.  
The first opening was great, and initially got me pumped up to watch the series.  It certainly made the show look pretty darn badass.  The second one, well... I was sad.  I don't like when spoilers are shown in openings, and I felt like SAO's second opening did just that.  I also didn't like the song nearly as much.  Oh well, maybe that's in part because I didn't like the second half as much :)
Initially, I really liked Kirito.  A kind of introverted badass that really shines on the battlefield of Sword Art Online.  But I felt he was a little too awesome.  I've played video games all my life, but there's no way anyone could be as good as Kirito was... ALL THE TIME.  It was a little annoying how he always found a way to win under any circumstance.  Because of this, I was never awarded the opportunity to feel suspense or nervous for the characters, I just knew Kirito would pull it out in the end.  
Asuna is just as bad.  Coincidentally, she is also a super badass warrior despite devoting most of here time in-game to taking up domestic hobbies such as cooking :)  She's a bit dull in personality, and not complex emotionally.  Her astounding love for Kirito is a little odd, considering it only took a few episodes for them to hook up.  She does look pretty hot as an elf though... Suguha is straight up annoying when not in game.  I mean come on, could we get any more fan-servicey around here!?  As Kirito's step sister, I liked her during the first half of the show... but not so much in the second half for obvious reasons.
I wish more time was spent on Klein and Kirito's relationship.  It would've been cool to see him have a sidekick, but he was being a little too emo, and wanted to do everything as a ""solo"" player.  Not cool Kirito! The rest of the ensemble was bland at best.  Nobody had any depth, and they introduced a couple of female characters near the beginning that seemed relevant, and were never really revisited.  Including one, who of course, fell in love with Kirito.  
The first villain's motive seemed a little bit unfounded, and was very one-dimensional.  There seemed to be a deeper side to them, but it was never really explored.  The second villain was a small redemption, a super creeper.  Their cause also seemed a bit odd, but judging from their personality, the actions didn't surprise me.
I really, really wanted to like SAO.  I'm not saying i didn't, because there definitely were some bright spots of the anime.  I just feel that so much more could of been done, while so much else was unneeded.  I would still recommend the series to fans of action or virtual reality animes, but if you're looking for something in depth intellectually, you might want to look elsewhere.  I did like it enough to start powering through the second season, and I will post my review when I finish it.",4
"
                Yes, I understand that the series isn't quite over yet, but I can tell from watching the first 10 episodes this is going to be an amazing anime. This show already has a place in my personal top 10 so I cant wait to finish the series. This show has a very good story with great characters. In most shows you will either hate or love a character without swaying that emotion. That's not the case in SAO. One minute you'll love a character and hate them the next, one minute you will have great suspense and the next will make you want to cry.
                  The Art is really good its one of the best I've seen so far. All in all this show is an emotional roller coaster of action, romance, and comedy. I would personally recommend this series to anyone because it can catch the interest of a wide range of people.
Thank you to all of those who took the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful.

                This review will contain select spoilers. Do not read if you don't like spoilers. Or go ahead. I'm a reviewer, not a cop.
I'd like to start off with, I have read the light novels up to volume 5, before the anime was created. So no comments about ""The light novel is better.""
I swear this anime is one of the most controversially discussed in the last few years, each side has their own valid points, and this review will have mine. You don't have to agree, this is just my speculation on the anime itself.
Story: (3/10) Although the story was a bit intriguing in the light
                  novels, I couldn't help but notice it was quite similar to //Hack.Sign. Being stuck in a virtual world, can't get out, and in Alfheim, you can die. Anyway, this story seems to be filled with wish-fulfillment for teenage boys. Prince on a white horse riding in and saving the day etc. all that stuff. There are contradictions everywhere, and Kirito didn't really have anything besides being either; Emo, or Badass. (Not the good kind of badass). Also the pacing was all over the place. First it takes an episode to beat one boss on the first level, and the next episode it completely skips to the 50+ floor. As well as the end of the first arc, you are finally reminded that this is a game and they don't know each other's real name, after several months.
Art: (6/10) The art style is good, though there were few moments in the anime where the animation was a little off, however it was not a big deal.
Sound: (9/10) Oh the sound was amazing, Openings, Endings, BGM, the sounding they used for the emotional and battle music (Although not that very emotional) were correctly used and I personally believe the music is too good for the anime. Seiyuus did a good job portraying emotion, but I think the thing that got annoying over time is the whole ""Kirito-kun!"" ""Onii-chan""
Charactes: (2/10) Okay now this is where shit went wrong. I'll describe each character one by one.
Kirito - His character development was almost at a standstill. The only things he is known for is being an emofag, or badass. His 'badassness' was brought in at episode 2 I believe where he acts like being a beta-tester was such a big deal, and knowing more information about the game makes you not even close to a cheater, just well informed. Out of 1000 Beta testers not one posted about the gameplay? It was the first boss, they'd most likely want to type a lot about their first boss fight. Furthermore, the term Beater is just horrible. He also seemed to be written in a way which says ""All the b**ches I meet want my d*ck"" You can't name a single female character that talked personally to him and wasn't already in-love with another character that didn't fall for him. Also his ability to somehow come back to life after having his life bar turned to nothing seems a tad bit convenient. In the beginning of the second arc, after Kirito had found out that Asuna was supposedly getting married to the most generic psychotic bastard out he went completely emo. He never once thought to himself in his depression ""Why can't I just catch him off guard and record everything he says"". But instead ran crying to his little imouto who has tits big enough to cover his head. Lastly, although there are many, MANY character faults I can find with him I will point out the one that I found most hilarious. Once his friend sent him the photo that seemed like Asuna from Alfheim, he rushed over, only to say shortly after discussing the possibility of finally meeting his 'wife' again. ""Hey, how's the gameplay?"" ....
Asuna: Okay, Asuna's character was fine in the first arc, however once the second arc rolled in she went from; decent heroine, to damsel in distress. Now that in normal cases would be fine, if you didn't consider the fact that Kirito got his data from SAO sent over to Alfheim, and somehow Asuna didn't? Also, if she is inside the game, and let's supposedly say that Generic Bad Guy reduced all her stats to 0, that would technically mean she wouldn't be able to move at all. Therefore in conclusion she would have her data left over, and DID still have her stats with massed agility. Next comes the chance she gets to escape. Escaping the 'cage' was smart on her part, except for the part where she finds the log out center and just looks around. And when she does finally find the log out button she hovers over it for seconds like she was screaming ""OH I WANT SOMETHING TO COME OUT AND STOP ME!"" Which she was then interrupted by tentacle monsters which is fan-service not at its finest. Also she mentioned in either the light novel or the anime that she did not mean to play the game, apparently it was a family members' and they were supposed to play it but had an unexpected situation change which got her to play it, which in the middle of the series she had the nerve to say ""I knew that putting on the NerveGear would lead me to Kirito.""
Suguha: Her character had to be the most pathetic in the whole anime. The only thing we knew her for was ""I LOVE ONII-CHAN"" and throughout the whole god damn series it was never answered. WHY THE F!@K DO YOU LOVE ONII-CHAN?"". And then comes the incest problem; OH HE'S NOT MY BROTHER! HE'S MY COUSIN SO IT'S OKAY TO LOVE HIM. No... No.. it's not okay to love him; IT'S STILL INCEST.
Kayaba: Although he was portrayed as a genius, I think the whole ""I'll end this game if you beat me here."" thing was something only a complete idiot would do. And of course he reinforces the fact that Kirito is badass, telling everyone that dual-wielding is only given to the person with the highest reaction time. At the end of the first arc, he is asked ""Why did you do it?"" To which he responded ""I don't know..."" how do you not know... I'm serious.. how do you not know your reason for trapping 10,000 people inside a virtual world, and essentially killing thousands of them; either emotionally or literally. And at the end of the second arc. He somehow finds his way through Alfheim giving Kirito GM powers, and apparently the reason he was able to do this was that he hacked himself into the internet. Even though apparently the statistics of it being successful were something like one to one million.
Sugou: Most generic bad guy personality. Showing a kind normal face to the people he uses and turns into a complete douche in front of his enemies and even revealing his 'master plan'. This guy has to have one of the biggest inferiority complexes against Kayaba it's not funny.
Side Characters: God damn Loli inferiority complex-filled annoying side characters.
Enjoyment: (2/10) I can see that this anime is completely portrayed to the teenage male demographic as to all the; wish fulfillment, unnecessary panty shots, giant and small tits, and who could forget the reinforcing of hope that you can find someone like Asuna.
Overall: (4/10) This anime gave me quite a few laughs, and it actually had a lot of potential and with correct writing could have been amazing, yet we are given... this... fanservice and wish-fulfillment filled anime.
And I'd like to end on a note that I find hilarious.
Glopping noise.",4

                It isn't uncommon in anime or otherwise, for the focal character to be whisked off into another plane, another place other than the world that the character is from. Sword Art Online is no exception to this, as it brings its audience, along with the main character, Kirito, into the world of a Virtual MMO called Sword Art Online, where the first arc of the story takes place.
As a series, I have a lot of mixed feeling about it.
In the first arc, I was disappointed that the anime so heavily revolved around the male lead and explored the surrounding characters with minimal depth. For me,
                  I felt this impeded on the character development. I did however feel that the quality of the first arc made up for this flaw. You are still introduced to some interesting and likeable characters throughout the entire series (all three arcs)
As a production you will not be disappointed with the quality of the graphics or fight sequences, which are creative and well executed. In terms of viewing interest, it was for lack of better words, a page turner. I found that I watched this anime at a rather fast pace. It did not bore me, but rather kept me interested. I thought this was an encouraging sign of things to come from this anime. 
I began to get a little disheartened with the second arc, which takes place in Alfheim Online, another VMMO.  The graphics and fight sequences remained solid, the creativity presented through Alfheim Online is also very pleasing. 
However, Alfheim Online focused around a love story rather than it being a story of survival. This dynamic also changed how I felt about the anime. The core qualities that I valued in the characters, especially the main male and female lead, were beginning to dilute. In the female lead, I enjoyed her as a strong female character, who was a leader and a fighter within the first arc. I feel that this sense of character is completely stripped from the roles she embodied in the second arc, which is best described as a helpless damsel in distress who no longer has much use in the series other than as a quest item for the male lead. The male lead, who had otherwise been a character that has fought for self-improvement and had to fight for his survival. This element is also vacant in the second arc. The antagonist in this arc was so stereotypical that it was painful. I watched it, with the hope that a series I once came to truly enjoy would redeem itself; why is it that so often, sequels are so disappointing?
I left Sword Art Online feeling like I had been treated unfairly. So much so, I feel like the second arc ruined the anime for me. I hadn't watched anime in such a long time prior to watching Sword Art Online. I owe the first arc to renewing my love of anime, but the second arc of the first season was nothing more than a disappointment. 
In conclusion. I would recommend watching the first 14 episodes of SAO. 
I would not recommend watching anything past that- including the second season.",6

                A Defense of Sword Art Online
Preface:
Sword Art Online:
Our basic premise is that 10,000 players from around the world have ventured into this new Virtual Reality MMO, called SAO. In this fantastical world, everything seems like a dream come true with the new ""full dive"" system that allows players to feel through their character, due to the headgear they wear that interfaces with their nervous system called NerveGear. That is, until it's revealed to them that the game is nothing more than a sick experiment by the twisted game creator, who warns that if the players die in the game, then they die in real life,
                  due to the electromagnetically powered NerveGear frying their brains. Any tampering with or attempt at removal of the NerveGear, and zap. The way out? Clear all 100 levels of Sword Art, defeat the final boss, and don't die.
Overview: 
ATTENTION: MINOR SPOILERS marked with *
All right. It's been said a million and a half times, everyone has a different and _very_ polarized opinion on this show. This review is *mine*. As stated on my profile, I believe that there is enjoyment to be gleaned from anything you choose to watch, and anyone who watched all 25 episodes of this and took it to the dump or praise it like the Helix Fossil (whether they believe they got something out of it or not), watched it for a reason. 
Starting with the pros:
Art: 10
Absolutely phenomenal artwork. I was routinely (and not to say complacent in) blown away by the background art. The animation is top notch as well. the intermediate animation (key frames) were very fleshed out, sharp, and fluid. Very consistent character design, and the dynamic lighting, shadows, and particle effects look amazing. Hair animation, which is a common irritant of mine, was animated very well. Boss battles were, of course, a standout moment, but even idle animation and pans were great... really good looking show- the budget was definitely used here.
Sound: 10
Openings and Endings had me jamming/singing along, background music fit very well. Sad moments, intense moments, victorious moments.. they all were accented by the BGM. Well done on this front.
Characters: 5
Here's where most people start to disagree on this show- I read several reviews before I started writing this, and most people bring up the Gary Stu/ Mary Sue (perfect in every way characters) and how they're undeveloped, and then you have these throwaway tack-on characters.
These are valid, but I see no reason why they have to detract from the experience. This isn't some high-thinking, extended philosophical metaphor filled mind stretching experience in the vein of Ergo Proxy or Ghost in the Shell, and YOU CAN'T FAIRLY JUDGE IT BASED ON SOMETHING IT'S NOT. 
This problem explains the huge disparity between scores on here. There's thousands of 1s, 2s, 3s, with no explanation given, just like there are 84853 perfect 10 ratings (at the time of this writing). Some people claim SAO is a bridge anime, one that gets people into it, and that's great- I'm all for that. Anime is a whole new world.  Others say it's just pretty looking overrated schlock, that's fine too. What _I_ see is: a lot of reactionary ratings to something that's undeniably popular, even if it's not the best thing out there. If it's about being a hipster and hating it because it's ""sew mainstreaum"", find some obscure 80s OVAs to watch and go harp on them (I recommend Violence Jack).
Character discussion:
Due to the nature of the show covering two distinct arcs, I'll try to differentiate the characters therein.
Kirito
Our MC. He's the VRMMO master, and it shows. He's able to tackle the challenges presented to him, usually with a show of equal parts heart and brute strength. As far as his traits, he has the drive to achieve his goals, no matter the personal cost to him, typical of the shonen hero. After a tragic incident early on, he also has this personal quest to never allow a friend or party member to die, because the death of his party members resonates with him so strongly. Once his love interest is introduced, his focus on survival shifts to her, and she becomes the only thing that matters in the death game.
Asuna
Our female protagonist, Asuna shows a surprising amount of depth in the first season (episodes 1-14) as a badass, take no crap, handles herself, heroine. Refreshing for the typical testosterone/angsty shonen series. She starts off a very insecure, fearful girl who is just trying to not die, and really develops into a star, becoming a famous player who's top tier on her own right. She isn't relegated to the sidelines until the second season (episodes 15-25), where she turns into a sort of Princess Peach type character in need of saving (here we go back into the shonen again). A jarring shift, for sure, but it didn't break the show for me.
Suguha
Kirito's sister. In the first half of the show, she is a minor side character, but comes into her own in the second arc. She is essentially the replacement of Asuna, but differentiated with the subplot of her complicated relationship with real life brother, and his avatar in the game. She provides some fanservice, but as a character, misguided as she may be, you feel for her, unless you're a troll with a stone heart.
There are other supporting characters, but nothing worth mentioning here.
****MINOR SPOILERS****
 Story: 4 (3.5 Arc 1+ 5 Arc 2)/2= 4.25 
Two arcs, I'll get into each separately and give a combined rating.
Arc 1: Episodes 1-14
Enter the death game, we follow Kirito through his trials and tribulations in the quest to beat SAO. Kirito is a solo player, and advances through the game on his own most of the time, until he is made an ""Offer He Can't Refuse"" and is forced to join a clan. Time continues on, circumstances arise, and Kirito leaves, and is faced with a battle that decides life and death for more than just himself.
There are several episodes which are just little one off adventures with a player in need of Kirito's help, which we call filler. Not much to report here.
The episodes people seem to find most egregious are 11-13, which basically boil down to playing house. While I found this really, really hokey, I reminded myself that this is an escapist story, filler as it may be. 
The pacing in this arc is rough. There are multiple timeskips, some of them numbering in months of time elapsed, and while it speeds up what might have been a monotonous repetition of ""clear the floor, kill the boss, next"", so there's that to be thankful for. What it does do, however, is turn this serious life-and-death drama into a bit of Slice-Of-Life. While the fact that the players could die at any time is never forgotten, it's pushed aside for several episodes in favor of the mundane.
There are a few tugging-at-heartstrings moments, but the two that come to mind weren't sold very well, as we didn't have enough time with the character in question to really be affected by their death that much.
At the end, we see a bit of the deus ex machina we've come to expect from shonen (think Yugioh's Heart of the Cards), but I never thought it took it too far into the disbelief breaking realm.
Score: 3.5
Arc 2: Episodes 15-25
Improvement on the pacing front. Kirito has just over a week to complete his mission, and I found myself asking, ""how many days are there left??"". This arc is the aforementioned ""Princess in Another Castle"" type. Without going into too much detail, Kirito and his sister Suguha unwittingly team up to save a friend, but all is not as it seems.
Much less filler this time around, and really no room for it.
This arc has a bit of a different subtext, and introduces some subplots, including that of a real life one. It's revealed to the viewer that Suguha has feelings for her brother, but that they're unrequited. These come into play later, when they figure out who each other are, and have to deal with the repercussions of the real life relationship they had before, and what it becomes afterward. 
The plot never gets into any stupid incest, and actually handles a very awkward situation well. It wasn't left unresolved, or unaddressed- it had a definite conclusion, and it was satisfying. This arc's plot is more emotionally charged, and I think it strengthened the show.
The second subplot I feel led to comment on is that of the villain. His appearance in the story seems a little forced, and his motives are laughable. He's relegated to being a cartoon evil-for-evil villain, only out to increase his own over-inflated ego and wallet. His resolution is satisfying though.
Score: 5
EDIT: One thing I think was a misstep was not exploring the mental state of Kirito and the other SAO players after essentially being dead for two years. I wanted to see how he adjusted to real life again, and how his relationships with his family and friends would have been affected after those long months amiss. The allusion to rehab, and the school for players of SAO were nice touches, but I can't imagine the trauma that must have caused some, and I think it would have added a personal touch.
****END MINOR SPOILERS****
Enjoyment: 8
I've beat the ultra defined, crisp, and fluidly animated animated horse to death a couple miles of text ago, but once more- the art. I've never seen anything as polished and expertly animated as this. During battle scenes, and even in stillframe with idle animation pans, I see dollars (or more accurately, yen) floating down in front of my eyes. It cost a chunk to make this look as good as it does, and it was worth every penny. 
I felt feels for the characters when appropriate, I laughed a few times at some things that were just stupid, and I cried foul at the hokey bits, but it was all part of the experience. I knocked a point for some unnecessary fanservice and the hokey-ness, but easy to enjoy.
Overall: 7 
Sword Art is perfectly enjoyable when viewing it for what it is, and in truth, it's a shonen; it falls into the typical shonen traps, but that doesn't mean it's poor on its own merit. It's gorgeous, a pleasure to actually watch move across the screen. It has its flaws, which I covered, but again, I sat back, engaged my suspension of disbelief, and I had a good time. Don't go looking for the meaning of life in this one, but if you're looking for a crisply animated tale of souls and swords, give it a spin.",7

                Its been a long time since I last made a review but anyways. Sword Art Online is interesting. That's one word to describe it, though I have only seen one episode I look forward to the next episodes and what will happen. This anime can be closely related to Accel Word which aired just last season and is still ongoing today. Both of these anime made me want to look for more and it doesn't bore you out. 
Story: 9/10 
Its basically a story where you fight for your life. This makes each episode anticipating. I can also relate this to Mirai Nikki, cause their
                  also playing a game in which they would have to win in order to live. It shows issues in society wherein gaming can highly influence an individual though I'm not quite sure if this would be seen in the next episodes but its the ""aura"" I got from watching it.
Art and Character: 10/10
Art was amazingly good. Its not old styled, not to much action detailed, but its your typical character with typical characteristics but each of the Characters have their own traits which would influence how they work throughout the anime
Sound: 9/10
I don't really pay attention to the Openings and endings since I usually skip it if I don't have time. but its sound effects are genuinely good making you look to the screen intently without distraction (thats the situation for me :D )
Enjoyment: 10/10
As much as I am enjoying Accel World right now, having Sword Art Online air is Great since It has a mixture of Accel World and Mirai Nikki wherein futuristic setting and death co-exist :)) 
Overall: 10/10
As of now, I look forward to the next episodes and I'm hoping that its aspects and flow of story won't change or drop down instead it would just raise higher.",10

                -semi-spoilers for first 15 episodes-
Honestly, its a fun show but this has to be the biggest escapism BS I have ever seen. If I was the author of this LN I would be hanging my head in shame that something so bad became so popular. The biggest problem with that is that this garbage is something I can see myself writing. 
Sure I would love to make up a world where I am a unapologetic gamer who gets stuck in this own element, because well... the real world is kind of boring. In a world where being amazing at gaming makes every girl you meet
                  fall hopelessly in love with you. And well... since you're amazing at leveling up skills you end up being able to date and eventually marry the most popular girl in high sch-- oh I mean in the gaming world. Plus the tall handsome guy who hangs out by her and even 'near' her house ends up being a murderous psychopath who you kill for the popular girl. Dont forget! if someone is stronger than you... well he must be cheating! 
Gosh... there is so much ridiculousness is in this series. I can totally see  why the reviews on this show is so divided. I watch anime because pretty much because it's a nice little escape. The problem here is that its not hidden enough, I can see clearly through the intentions of even the most banal plot point. I am kind of old but I sincerely hope a younger version of me would never like this... because well if he did I could never live with myself.",4
"
                I'm not sure why this show seems to be getting so much hate, but before reading my review let me say that I didn't read the novels or anything. 
First off, I agree with what most people say here, that the premise of SAO is very interesting and that the concept wasn't executed as well as it could have been, but it still did a satisfying enough job to keep me hooked. I watched the first 10 episodes in one day and still wanted to keep watching. I did feel somewhat cheated out of a lot of potential episodes though because they kept showing seemingly
                  random interactions/side plots with other characters in the world of SAO instead of actually showing the battles and the progression through the floors.
Once the second arc started [with the fairies], though, I sort of lost interest in it. The reason I was watching in the first place was for the game of SAO and the principles of that game.
As for the characters, I really liked them and even though the relationship between Kirito and Asuna was kind of rushed, I still found myself thoroughly enjoying their screen time together. The supporting characters are also likeable and added to the humor.
Overall, I'm going to keep watching SAO all the way through because I'm invested in the characters, but I hope that the story improves in the upcoming episodes.",8
"
                Sword art online has a lot of problems, and i mean a lot.
The story itself isnt to bad (besides being ripped straight out of spy kids 3d), personally I liked the idea of it all but this is not where SOA's faults lie.
First lets start off with the art. I think fight scenes are very well choreographed and SOA doesnt skimp much on quality either, very rarely will you find just a black screen with white slashes all over the place to indicate a fight. The art wasnt anything special though.
Sound wasnt very notable at all
Here we go, the characters... You got your yandere, your
                  tsundere, your lolis,  and your bland overpowered protagonist, its hard to find a stereotype not in this anime. I wouldnt have a problem if one of these is just part of  a characters personality but all the characters in SOA are incredibly 1 dimensional and play their parts out exactly to order. 
Kirito is obviously the bland protagonist who is for whatever reason extremely overpowered. Its almost as if he has no free will of his own because i always know what hes going to say next, whether its ""i wont let you die"" or ""stay with me forever"" or something along those lines. And how the hell did he get so strong? he solos the boss by himself when an entire team who should have been around his level cant do shit? yeah definitely.
 Next we have Asuna or as i like to call her ""tsundere bitch"". First off lets make it very clear i hate tsundere. to me its the most overused female protagonist character model ever. It seems like an excuse for people not wanting to develop your characters, because since they are tsundere a punch or a kick takes care of what 5 minutes of dialogue would have done. Its really sad because asuna could have been an actual character. But oh well. 
Next we have the lolis, oh god the lolis. First is that one dragon bitch who lost her virtual dog or something and then made kirito go and get it. This ark of the story was probably the worst because she kept complaining about her whory cloathing and didnt just change. She was also super slutty towards kirito even though she was clearly 5-6 years younger than he, and another reason this was the worst ark was one scene in the garden when this girl gets kidnapped by a giant tentacle plant and her first move of defense is pulling down her skirt.....  cant tell if all the tentacles were supposed to be a joke or if they were serious, sigh oh well.
Next loli on the list is Yui or Yue I forget. Scratch what i said before about dog bitch having the worst ark this was by far the worst. The only thing i hate more then Tsundere girls is arks that try and make you care about characters only to kill them. The first problem i had with this ark is that Yui/Yue is a stereoypical one dimensional loli. Which is a problem we encounter a lot in this anime. When 3-4 one dimensional characters are having a conversation it doesnt feel like a conversation, more like a script thats being read to me.
 'let me guess she wants to keep the kid'
 ""ILL BE YOUR MOMMY""
 'and let me guess, loli girl loves the idea of random strangers being her parents'
 ""OKAY MOMMY I LOVE YOU"" *proceeds to hug stranger*
If you think hard enough you can predict every single scene in SOA. but anyway the next problem with Yui/Yue is that they gave away her death at the very beggining. at first it wasnt obvious, a little character develepmont (though theres hardly anything to develop). But when animes go into character development overdrive and everything else in the story halts you know that character is a goner. So I knew when i saw all chat consisted of ""mommy i love you"" She was dead. a pathetic attempt at the kill a loli formula.
Overall if found sword art online to be an awful anime besides obvious plot WTF's like kirito getting out of bed from a 2 year coma in about 20 seconds. Or the couple not actually saying where they live in the real world. SOA has some serious character problems. From tsundere to loli and everything in between, the only plus i could think of were the fight scenes which were admittedly badass. I cant bring myself to give this anime a 1. So if your looking for a nice fighting anime, i would recommend soul eater which says screw you to plot development and just focuses on fighting. I literaly cant think of a reason to recommend SOA over another anime. If your looking for an emotional anime with swords i would say claymore. If your looking for just an emotional anime in general i would recommend anohana.
So i guess what i am saying is that SOA tries hard at what it tries, and it succeeds in some aspects, but there are so many other anime that do all these things so much better its hard to recommend",4

                Review/opinion on Sword Art Online. 
I guess it is fair to say that SAO is the most prominent, or at least hyped, anime of the past 2012 year. And I can see why. It starts with a blast. The first three episodes made me think that i'm watching a masterpiece that will definitely be one of the best shows I've ever seen. Only later to disappoint.
I'll start with what I really liked:
The concept of this anime: showing a life in a virtual reality. We've seen it before in Matrix, but here the virtual reality is a game and the world was an Avatar (the movie
                  from 2009)-like eye-candy (as you may suspect from VLMMORPG universe). SAO shows implications of a large group of people trapped together in virtual reality for a long period of time and sometimes poses deep questions (for example whether they should face death trying to break from this world if they are so happy inside SAO, in my opinion the fact that i paused the show for a moment to think what i'd do, proves the quality of this part of SAO). If you are a gamer you’re going to love the parts when they talk about common issues with online RPG, such as beta-testers advantage. Also the fights and actions sequences: it’s a shounen where heroes live in RPG so one has to expect epic boss battles. I was afraid that they will add too much of them but fortunately all the battles were very relevant to the main plot.
What went wrong.
The whole romance thingy. The bond between Kirito and Asuna felt cheesy and pushy. But that’s nothing compared with other semi-romantic relationships with almost every met girl including his own sister (yes,  yes I know she isn’t really his real sister just a cousin but they lived together as siblings, btw. What’s with siscon is anime?). Every girl falls for him instantly. Some reviewer called it ‘episodic harem’ and I really like such a term, because to my dismal, in one episode I felt like I’m watching a harem ecchi. Let’s add unnecessary fan-service (including almost a tentacle rape) and top with [SPOILER] his sister falling for him in RL and then again in VR in game.
Inconsistent plot. Among many issues I have: the main characters are too strong. Kirino admits that SAO world is fair and logical but he is way too strong compared to others especially for a solo-player that doesn’t always fight at the front-lines (=highest levels achievable) and makes lots of detours. It really felt like the author had a great concept to start a show but run out of ideas and decided to throw generic anime settings and deus ex machinas (ass-pulls) to fill the gaps and created an adolescent fairy tale. 
Two cents about the main characters:
I don't have many issues with Kirito. He is supposed to be a lone hero, an outsider who perfectly fits into an MMO virtual world and as such he does the job. He is the hero that i guess many players would like to be or at least experienced his journey. His portrayal went too far with his allure towards the feminine part of population, basically he was a chick magnet for no apparent reason. 
Asuna is a lost character. At first she is strong-willed, determined, gorgeous (Asuna is very pretty even by anime standards) girl who could become an anime Katniss Everdeen (heroine from Hunger Games). But later in the story she became a winner of Kirito's harem (i exaggerate but i think one can get the point), his girlfriend and wife with super improved cooking skills and nothing more... and she could be so much more.
And villains: Disney-like bad guys with no depth whatsoever (especially the villain from the second arc).
Overall
I've read somewhere that Sword Art Online is the most overrated and underrated anime of 2012. Overrated by zealous fans who claim that this is the best anime 'evaaah' and underrated by community critics who bash obvious shortcomings (btw. The same goes for Naruto – just a thought about the most popular and the gateway anime). And it’s true: the faults are clearly visible for anyone who’s not totally new to the genre but it’s really not that bad. I was captivated by the main part of the story and I did enjoyed it. Overall I can give it a generous 7, which represents what Sword Art Online really is – a slightly disappointing, but good nevertheless anime.",7
"
                The future of the video game industry is here, and it’s gone far beyond the motion capture and voice commands that we raved about in the past.  MMORPGs...  Or Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games...  Have evolved beyond what was previously thought possible, thanks to an innovation called The Full Dive...  A Virtual Reality system that syncs directly with your brain to transfer your very consciousness into an expansive, lifelike gaming universe where people from all over the world can interact and compete for hours on end while they’re bodies remain nice and safe in their beds.  How can a gaming
                  experience such as this possibly go wrong?
One of these new games, Sword Art Online, has taken the market by storm, becoming a fast fan favorite due to it’s simple mechanics and universal accessibility.  But then one day, a curious flaw appears in the system...  The log out button mysteriously disappears, leaving over ten thousand players stranded.  And instead of an update or a patch to fix this issue, game creator Kayaba Akihiko gives them the most horrible news they could have possibly imagined...  There is no way out.  This world is now their world, and thanks to a booby trap hidden in their headsets, to die in the game...  Or to have your headset removed by an outside party...  Will mean their immediate real life death.  The only way to leave is to clear all 100 floors of the game, a task that winds up in the hands of the best and strongest players in the game...  Including Kirito, a former beta tester.  Can the thousands of forsaken souls trapped in their former escapist paradise ever see the real world again, or is all hope lost?
Whether you love or hate this series...  And there are a lot of people claiming both extremes...  There’s one thing everyone seems to agree on;  The animation in SAO is phenomenal.  Studio AI, which was founded by a former Sunshine producer, has a very impressive resume behind them, having worked on several popular and visually spectacular titles like Fairy Tail, Black Butler, and Magi(none of which I’m personally fond of).  Their flair for expensive, all out, balls-to-the-wall action and movement is on full display here, with special attention being given to the expansive backgrounds, smoothly integrated CGI and the infinitely expressive countenances of it’s many cast members.  Unfortunately, the negative aspects of A1’s animation technique has also been carried over, as the cost cutting and corner cutting are everywhere, and it’s never subtle about it.  
For all the graceful animation we get with our main cast, you get crowds of people in the background just frozen like they’re part of the background rather than people living in it.  For all the fast-paced, intense battle scenes, there are just as many where the aesthetic become cheaper and looser in order to compensate for the constant movement...  And as I’ve mentioned in previous reviews, that kind of technique can make a show look really awkward when paused.  Because of this, I don’t think I can get behind all of the other reviewers who call this one of the best looking shows they’ve ever seen, but I understand why it looks the way it does, and I do generally think it does it’s job fine.  After all, there aren’t a lot of studios who have Kyoto Animation-level budgets behind them, so the lack of consistency can be largely forgiven...  I just wish it’d been managed a bit better.
The musical score, on the other hand, is nothing short of breathtaking.  Yuki Kajiura is one of the most respected composers in the industry for a damn good reason, and while she’s not quite as prolific as Yoko Kanno, the difference in style more than makes up for it.  Almost all of the more memorable and emotionally stimulating moments in the series might have fallen flat if not for the expertly crafted and highly versatile tunes that she made to accompany them.  Whether the tone of the series needs to be tense, frightening, somber, uplifting or full on heart-rending, Kajiura’s nearly celtic-sounding score always has the right tunes at the right time.  For the best example of this, the low-pitched track ‘despaired’ is the saddest part of the already tragic episode 3.  Her music has a very manipulative quality to it, and yes, I mean that in a good way.
I wish I could go on to say that this series is a master of sound, but while the music excellent, the english dub is a bit...  Well, mediocre.  It was done by Bang Zoom, who were surprisingly able to pick up a few funimation actors for the job.  I’ve never really been a huge fan of Bryce Papenbrook...  Although he was decent in Blood Ladd...  And as Kirito, he sounds distractingly like Vic Mignogna going through puberty.  Cherami Leigh as Asuna didn’t impress me very much either.  When I saw her name attached to the character, I thought...  Why?  Don’t get me wrong, she’s a great actor, but she doesn’t have a lot of experience playing tough or intimidating women.  Her voice is too high pitched and airy for it, and the part should have gone to someone with a deeper voice like Michelle Ruff.  I won’t say either one of them did a bad acting job, they did fine, I just don’t find the casting believable in either case.
The rest of the cast, for the most part, is full of Bang Zoom regulars, with only a few sour notes in what is otherwise an okay dub overall.  Cassandra Lee was very impressive as Leafa, especially when you consider the kind of character she’s been saddled with.  Christine Marie Cabanos better than usual as Silica, but she’s still way below her Toradora performance.  Marianne Miller, as Recon, is somebody I want to never, ever hear in a dub again.  The only real standout performance is from Todd Haberkorn, who takes full advantage of his role as the narcissistic sociopath Sugo Noboyuki to be as sleazy and unlikeable as he possibly can, and boy is it glorious.  It’s a fine, listenable dub, but you’d do a lot better to just watch it in Japanese with subtitles.  
Then again, you can’t really blame the actors for being mediocre when the characters they’re playing are so terribly, terribly written.  Starting with Kirito, there’s very little depth to his character.  He has trouble working with other people, he feels some serious guilt in his life, and these issues do give him some potential for development...  But that’s it.  Beyond that, he’s just a self insert male empowerment fantasy, which becomes even more blatant when you start to notice just how much of his story was inspired by Guts from Berserk.  He’s an overpowered loner who travels the world being a better fighter than everyone else, and he’s even nicknamed The Black Swordsman.  And if that’s not enough, the circumstances surrounding his membership in Asuna’s guild are very reminiscent of Guts’ joining and leaving of The Band of the Hawk.
But then again, Guts never took it a step too far by becoming a harem lead...  Okay, maybe at ONE party.  There number of female characters in this series who don’t develop feelings for him could easily be counted on one hand, with a finger or two to spare.  Out of the ones who do, he’s generally the one helping them through their problems while they get strung along helplessly, regardless of their levels(Except for Suguha, but we’ll get to that).  This even includes Asuna, who follows him through a murder mystery story arc while HE solves every clue, and even though she holds the final piece of the puzzle the whole damn time, he’s the one who solves it after she mentions a key SAO marriage detail out loud.
And Asuna?  That’s another issue entirely.  Up until my recent rewatch of SAO, I thought she was the best thing about the series...  But it didn’t take me long to realize that there’s even less to her character than there is to Kirito’s character.  She’s a strong fighter, but she’s not a very strong character.  In fact, if you took the romance out of her relationship with Kirito, IE their marriage and what-not, she could have easily been replaced with a fighting dog, especially when their meet-cute happened because he earned her trust with food.  
Her transformation into a damsel in distress in the second story arc is something I used to fervently defend...  I used to say that as bad-ass as she was prior, the new circumstances were understandable, because her unkillable captor took away all of her in game abilities and molded her into his ideal version of her...  Meek, helpless, and at his mercy.  I used to say that this scenario was an allegory for the damsel in distress trope, and that it said more negative things about men from Oberon’s control of him than it did for women with her submission to him.  Hell, I even claimed it was a metaphor for the sexist bondage of Japanese marriages.  But having read the light novels, and realizing just how immature and ignorant the original author’s world views are, I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’d been pulling this analysis directly out of my anus.  These circumstances are really meant to be taken at face value, and the fact that Asuna doesn’t manage to escape when given a chance just brings the entire situation right down into the doldrums for me.
And then you have Kirito’s other love interests, and dear god, are there a lot of them.  Two characters are introduced in the early episodes who enlist him for help, fall madly in love with him, and are then dropped for most of the remaining series, only to be brought back at the end to reveal that they still haven’t given up on him.  Because yeah, I really care about that.  Two characters from the second arc start pressing their boobs against his arms because he defended them from an ambush, and then...  There’s his sister.  Yes, Suguha, his little sister, is in love with him.  I’ll grant you that they’re actually cousins, but for reasons that I stated in my Oreimo review, that doesn’t make it any better.  This is popularly labelled the worst part of the series, and...  Yeah, but it didn’t have to be.  I wouldn’t have minded her falling in love with kirito in the game, due to not knowing who he is, but the fact that she’s already fallen for him in real life just kills it.
And then you have the villains.  Each story arc contains one true villain, set aside as the final boss of their respective worlds, and a smaller villain who causes some events to occur, goes nowhere afterwards, and then is completely forgotten about in the story.  There are a lot of potential for these two MAIN villains, but the way they’re perceived by both the fans and the story is truly baffling.  People tend to hate the second villain, Sugu, because he imprisoned one woman and tried to take over the IRL world.  What they seem to forget is that the first villain is directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of probably innocent people.  And that wouldn’t be the show’s problem if it wasn’t for the fact that SAO actually seems to share this bizarre thought.  Spoiler alert...  The first villain gets redeemed at the end because he opposes the second one, and it was a genuinely good thing to do, but it still feels like watching hitler receive a metal of honor for stopping a rapist.  Yeah, that guy was a rapist, and you did a great thing...  But you’re still Hitler.  It just makes for a weird and icky ending.
So if this series has an inconsistent dub, poorly written characters, and some unsettlingly deep levels of sexism, why is it so popular?  Why is it such a huge hit, as well as a major financial success?  I said earlier that the strongest element of SAO is it’s musical score, but it’s most successful element is the execution of it’s story.  SAO bets all of it’s chips on suspense, tempting the audience to keep coming back because they can’t keep the ongoing conflicts and how they’ll be resolved out of their heads.  And it works.  The news of entrapment and possible death in the SAO universe hits the heart hard, bringing some serious stakes to the table, and they play with this concept in all the right ways and at all the right moments...  Right up until it’s resolution, in one of the most perfectly timed and logically stupid plot twists I’ve ever seen.  It made more sense in Berserk.
For the most part, the other looming conflicts are just as powerful.  Even if you don’t like the characters, you want to know whether or not Kirito and Asuna will end up together.  you want to know what’ll happen when Suguha’s true identity is revealed to him.  You want to know if Kirito will be able to rescue Asuna before the ticking clock of the second story arc runs out.  You want to know just how many people will die before their trials in SAO are finally safely over.  It’s easy to get invested in these conflicts, which is probably the main reason so many people get hooked during their initial viewing...  But with that tactic, SAO suffers a very significant trade-off in the form of some absolutely miserable rewatch value.  Upon a second viewing, any viewer will already know exactly where the story is heading, and how each conflict will be resolved, which takes the suspense right out of the series...  Forcing you to admit just how weak and sexist the characterizations are, and how badly written a lot of the side stories are.  And how superior Log Horizon is.
Sword Art Online is available from Aniplex.  The officially released Region 1 DVDs were split into quarters, with each disk holding about 6-7 episodes...  For more than fifty dollars each.  Yeah, in order to actually own a tangible copy of this entire twenty-five episode series with the english dub intact, you will have to shell out over two hundred dollars.  Even if you’re a fan of the series, it’s not worth even half of that price.  Luckily, there are other options available, and I’m not just talking about the much more affordable Malaysian bootlegs on Ebay. You can find SAO on Crunchyroll, and at least for now, you can also find it for free on Netflix.  The original light novels are currently being released in English alongside a translated manga adaptation, but I’ve read the first volume of each, and they’re completely awful.  Do not waste your time and money on them.  There’s a second season too, but I haven’t seen it yet.
I’ve been told by a great many people that Sword Art Online does not accurately portray the MMO gaming experience, but speaking as someone who has never played an MMO in his life, I really don’t care.  I came into this series looking for a good story, exciting action and memorable characters, and to it’s very minimal credit, SAO almost has those qualities.  It has a definite cool factor in it’s concept and design, and it does as good a job as possible covering up it’s lackluster content with outstanding production values and musical direction.  I want to give it credit for presenting an emotionally gripping storyline, and while that storyline doesn’t really hold up under repeated viewings, there are a handful of moments that are just as powerful no matter how many times you see them.  It’s a mixed bag to be sure, but I don’t think it’s as terrible as it’s most fervent haters claim, nor is it the worst way to pass the time.  I give Sword Art Online a 5/10.",5
"
                Overall, I didn't think SAO was anything special, despite all the hype I've seen.
I didn't find the art anything special; it's very on-par with what is expected these days. I enjoyed the score very much, good to see Yuki Kajiura's compositions.
I found that the story timeline  moved at an odd pace - they would suddenly jump forward a few months (following a somewhat filler-feeling episode). The first arc I found to be more enjoyable than the second arc, as I felt the second was just slapped on to make the series longer. It didn't really seem to fit in (they could have ended the
                  season after the first arc and everything still would have been okay, no major loose ends that could have contributed toward needing another arc). 
The story had too many moments that were seemingly out of the blue, too many deus ex machina moments that went unexplained (both times in desperate situations the main character just magically manages to override the system with no explanation?). Characters were generic, in my opinion; every girl that he met that was approximately his age would fall for him for no reason...
I've heard much hype about SAO, but also heard a lot of negative reviews about it. I'll continue watching the second season, and the extras just for the sake of completely watching the series, but I don't expect much from them.",6
"
                Sword Art Online is a wildly popular light novel that skyrocketed in popularity, and has spawned its own anime series. The anime series has suffered from what almost every popular anime tends to suffer from: People either hating it and bashing it in to the ground or overrating it. To be totally honest, SAO is no where near ""the best anime evuurrrr!!11"" and yet its still a pretty decent show that's far from the worst. What was actually a pretty interesting concept and story was marred by its poor execution and sloppy characterization. 
[ Story 5/10 ]
The story takes place in two ""arcs."" The first
                  is the Sword Art Online arc and takes place during the first 12 episodes. The second arc is the Alfheim Online arc, which is during the last 12 episodes. The light novel actually continues past these arcs, but the anime only covers these two arcs. The first arc suffers from poor execution and an unnecessary focus on useless, one time only side characters. Luckily it gets better during the second arc.
The first episode establishes the conflict of SAO. The creator of the game, Akihiko Kayaba, has made it so the players can not log out of the virtual MMO. In order to be freed from the game, they must work together to clear all 100 floors of the game's tower. Death in the game means death in real life. Forcibly taking off the Nerve Gear headset from the outside world also means certain death. There is no way around this ""game"" Akihiko has laid out. Panic ensues. 
The second episode consists of the main character Kirito and a group of other players attempting to clear the boss of the first floor. These first two episodes are great at displaying the panic and desperation of the situation. In terms of drawing in the viewer, they definitely do their job well. But then whatever excitement you had might quickly whittle away by the next few episodes. 
The next few episodes focus on a bunch of side characters that Kirito will help out of their jam. And then you won't see most of them again for several episodes. Many you will never see again until a brief scene in the ending. You won't remember their names and you won't care. After their episode they will go about their business and you won't hear another peep from them. One episode even shows several side characters dying. But it hardly even stirs up any emotion in you. After all, how can you be sad when they were just introduced this episode and you didn't even get time to get attached to them, much less learn their names?
And this could have been used as an opportunity to develop Kirito a little. But Kirito hardly changes throughout the anime. Oh wait, he gets more and more overpowered. But more on that in the character section. Which brings me to another point: The romance. Kirito and Asuna's romance feels a little forced, like it just sprung out of nowhere. They're friends one episode, then the next, they get married and love each other so much that they'd die for each other. This is probably due to the anime skipping around so much. You'll probably notice this when you see Kirito's level spike throughout the anime when we hardly ever see him train. 
Now on to the second arc. The second arc is much better in almost every way. Almost. The story really picks up. There is less of a focus on useless side characters. The main villain is much better and has way more of a presence than Kayaba. You'll actually cheer when Kirito defeats this scum. The execution and pacing of the second arc isn't perfect but its much better than the first arc. It's a shame that the first arc couldn't work out like the second one could. 
All in all, the story is just average. It redeems itself and drags itself out of trainwreckville once the second arc starts. But its kind of hard to forgive the boring episodes that followed such an epic start. 
[ Characters 5/10 ]
Like the story, most of the characters are also just average. First, we have the main character Kirito. He can do anything, no questions asked. Even when it seems he's going to lose, he always comes out on top. We never really see him train either, as the anime just jumps around a lot in the first arc and his level randomly spikes.  We never really see Kirito's struggle to get stronger, he just is. He's automatically awesome and the hero with little faults. In that sense, he's a bit of a Gary Stu. But he's not a bad character. He's still likeable. But he's not a particularly well written character either. 
There is also Asuna, the main heroine. In the first few episodes, she's parades on the scene as this little cloaked badass. At first it seemed like she was gonna be a pretty strong heroine. But then later she turns into your usual run of the mill tsundere. Not only that, but she turns into the damsel in distress in the second arc and is pretty much out of action for most of it. Like Kirito, she's not a straight up bad character. She's still tolerable and very much likeable, but there isn't anything particularly special about her. 
There is also Kirito's sister Suguha and the virtual AI Yui that later becomes Kirito and Asuna's ""daughter."" The relationship between Yui, Asuna, and Kirito is very cute. Actuallya lot  cuter than Kirito and Asuna's romance. The scenes between the three just make you wanna go Aww. 
Now for the villians. The main villain in the first arc is Kayaba Akihiko. And he fails at being an interesting villain. He mostly sits back and watches the players scurry around frantically trying to clear the game. He gets little screen time and has almost no personality to speak of. The villain in the second arc is much more interesting. Noboyuki Sugo, also known as King Oberon is a complete bastard of a villain who you will hate with a passion. He's sick, ruthless, and cunning. He also has way more of a presence than Kayaba did, always taunting Kirito and getting in the way of his reunion with Asuna. He's a great villain and after his actions in episode 24, you'll be screaming for him to go down. 
Then there are a myriad of side characters that will either appear once or from time to time. They don't really serve any purpose other than to help Kirito out occasionally. The characters in SAO are tolerable and most are pretty likeable. But the main characters don't go through any significant character development. And most of the side characters are pretty forgettable. 
[ Art and Sound 8/10 ]
The music is composed by the one and only Yuki Kajiura. Having composed a number of epic tracks for video games and anime, there's a lot to expect from SAO's soundtrack. SAO's soundtrack is a cut above your average everyday anime soundtrack but its far from Kajiura's best work. 
The character designs are very soft and cute. The characters have round faces, big eyes, and hair colors that could be likened to an assortment of skittles. There are a few more rugged character designs for a few male characters and more mature looking designs for about two or three female characters. Overall, the character designs are pretty good. 
The animation is good for the most part. Though some of the fight scenes look a bit sloppy and off. 
[ Enjoyment 7/10 ]
I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this anime at all. As you can tell, I didn't particularly enjoy the first part of the series. I stopped watching this anime during the first part several times to go watch something else. But by about episode 17, the anime really started to pick up for me and I was eager for the weeks to pass so I could see what happened next. Despite my harsh criticism, I enjoyed the series overall. It was far from the worst anime I've seen.
[ Overall 6/10]
Overall, SAO is a decent anime. I've seen this anime get terrible reviews that peg it with 2s, 3s, and 4s, citing it as the ""worst thing ever."" And then there are people handing out 10s and 9s like hotcakes. I respectfully disagree with both of these people. And in turn, I've got some advice for anyone who's thinking of getting in to this show: please take the middle ground. Don't write off the anime as the worst thing in existence that needs to be killed with fire. This show honestly is not that bad. Yet, don't go in expecting ""OMG THE BEST ANEEMAY EVARR!!11"" because I guarantee you that you will be sorely disappointed. 
The good and the bad:
+ Fairly enjoyable
+ A lot of great action
+ Good music
+ Nice character designs and animation
+ Second arc is pretty good
- Weak story 
- So so characters that get little to no development
- First arc is poorly executed with too big a focus on one time only side characters",6
"
                So. I'm going to be honest. I loathe this anime. Unfortunately, I had a good friend recommend this to me (sorry, but there's almost nothing but criticism ahead), so I went in with high expectations and fell far to end up with such a low opinion on Sword Art Online. However, I will explain myself and break down point by point why I hate this anime. Prepare for a long ass review.
First, let's get the very small amount of ""good"" out of the way:
_____
ART/ANIMATION: 8/10
Hey, you can't go wrong with A-1. Their standards of animation are high, and it's no different with Sword Art Online.
                  The scenery, art design, and everything is pretty and nice looking. The only reason why this category gets 8 instead of a 10 is because the character designs for the protag and all of the female characters are bland looking and fall under ""generic cuteness"".
SOUND: 6/10
Well.... the soundtrack is okay. It doesn't stand out or anything, but it's decent enough. It fit the anime itself and that's that, and the two theme songs are pretty catchy. Basically what it comes down to is that I don't have an issue with it, and that's one of the best opinions I can have for SAO.
VOICE ACTING: 7/10
This is not a category by itself, but I don't like stuffing both the acting and the soundtrack/music under one category. The voice acting is all around good. Though there were only two or three standout voice actors (and for minor characters, too). None of the voice actors for the main characters were good enough to actually improve their characters, but they did what they could.
_____
Now, the bad (oh, there is so much of it):
_____
STORY: 3/10 (first story arc) + 1/10 (second story arc) = 2/10 overall
This is arguably the part of SAO I feel saddest about. Not mad, like how I feel about the characters. Because honestly, the first story arc (Aincrad) had a lot of potential. It could've been amazing. But no. It was thrown away in favor of silly filler episodes with one-shot characters who do nothing and contribute nothing and have no presence or personality.
And let's not even get started on the second story arc (Alfheim). It makes the Aincrad arc look like solid gold, it's seriously that bad. It's awful and cliché, like many things in this anime. The story that the first arc had to offer was more than enough for 25 episodes, so the second story arc was never even necessary.
There were a lot of pacing issues with both arcs, but especially the first arc (plot twist, this is one thing the second arc did better) because it felt like there were large chunks of story and development missing between each episode.
In conclusion: First story had potential, but threw it away with awful execution. Second story arc was awful in all respects and never should have been made in the first place.
----
CHARACTERS: 1/10
Like many reviewers before me have said, THIS is the part of SAO that is, by far, the weakest. I'm going to cover the main characters individually and then cover the other characters in groups. Sorry, this section is going to be a little long.  Some minor spoilers ahead.
A) Kirito (male protagonist cause this is shounen, and they're always male). 
Long story short, he's a Gary Stu. He has no flaws. He has no weaknesses. He never falters, never makes a mistake, is never unkind or selfish (except for in maybe the first two episodes). He's boring and is one of the least compelling protagonists I have ever seen. He gets little-to-no character development and it's just so hard to get invested in him. Unless, of course, you put in yourself in his place as a self-insert. Sorry, but that sort of thing is only acceptable in real video games. And when you think about it, it really puts you at a disadvantage if you're a female and straight. Anyway, enough about Kirito. Though he's the most boring protagonist I've ever watched, I don't actively dislike him. He's just dull.
B) Asuna (female lead/love interest)
She's also a Mary Sue. Except tsundere. Initially, she's... kind of decent. She's badass, at least, but it's also so typical that it doesn't mean anything. She still lacks any sort of individuality or identity. Unfortunately, it gets a worse when she becomes friends with Kirito.
But you know what, I didn't actively dislike her character until the second story arc. You know why? The writers thought it would just be a fantastic idea if she was further stripped of her identity and agency and turned into some helpless damsel in distress who's there just for Kirito to rescue her. How insulting. I can't go into detail, but what they did to her was pretty disgusting to me. Way to turn an already weak female character into something utterly useless and use detestable tropes to make the audience feel more sympathetic for her. I can't tell you how much I hated the Alfheim arc because of this. This accounts for half of my anger, actually. The other half lies with the next character: 
C) Suguha (talk about incest subtext)
My main question is: Why was she even needed? 
My second is: Why does she need to be in love with Kirito?
Look, let me make things clear, when it comes to incest, I have almost no opposition to it in fictional works. But here, it makes no sense and only serves to make a useless love triangle. Considering how she was raised to think that she was Kirito's sister for 10 years, this shouldn't even happen (look up the Westermarck effect). But apparently the writers couldn't let one major recurring female character not be in love with Kirito, so. If she was just a sister character and they developed her relationship with Kirito without her being in love with him, she might've been decent. Maybe. But probably not because as you know, good female characters are just impossible to write. 
D) Yui (the odd surrogate daughter)
Okay, so I'm just going to briefly touch on her character and say that it's stupid to me how she's the surrogate daughter of Kirito and Asuna. One of her purposes is to be cute. The other is to be an exposition fairy, and she is quite literally that in the Alfheim arc. I suppose one should be grateful that she's not in love with Kirito, but she's still another useless female character and her entire role tastes like diabetes. It's just that saccharine and syrupy sweet.
E) Other Supporting Female Characters
It's really annoying how almost every single major (as in, gets a decent amount of screen time) female character falls in love with Kirito for next to no reason. It's one thing to have a crush on him because he's cute, but every female (bar Yui) is almost instantly in love with him. What's even worse is that they usually need him to save them, so they're mostly damsels. Unfortunately, because this show is shounen, female characters suffer that much more. They're all generically cute and in love with Kirito, and none of them actually do anything except serve to boost Kirito as a ladies' man. They don't really have much personality either. Well, at least they have more than Kirito does, but they have so little presence that it doesn't matter.
F) Supporting Male Characters
Well, there's Klein. Whom I personally dub as ""the only SAO character who matters"". Because, yes, he's the only one I actually care about. It's amazing, he's only on screen for about 15 minutes total, but he still brings so much life and personality. The other male characters are pretty cool too. Agil, Heathcliff, Recon in the Alfheim arc (though he gets very little screentime), etc. Even though they're there even less than the female characters, they're at least memorable and unique and in Klein's case, downright loveable. But, as expected, they frequently get tossed aside in favor of some female character or another to fawn all over Kirito. But I enjoy them when they're there, so it's nice that they at least exist.
G) Villains
The villain of the first story arc is actually pretty decent. He's the only other character I find interesting besides Klein, but he's there for such a short amount of time that it was impossible to attach myself to him. Oh, but like the plot, he had potential. He was good when he was on screen. I'm always wishing he got more development and screen time.
The second villain though... I can't tell you how bad he is. He's a cartoony (albeit, more risque), cardboard cut-out villain who has no depth at all. He's awful as both a person and a villainous character, so you can't even enjoy him as an over-the-top villain because they made him just that unlikeable.
H) Character Relationships (not a character, but needs to be addressed)
The second biggest problem with the characters aside from the fact that they're all so poorly written. No one relationship gets development. No, the writing pretends that it gets development, but there's almost none. For example, there's a lot of time spent with Kirito and Asuna, but their ""romance"" is as forced and cliche as can be. Actually, almost every relationship feels forced and cliche. Basically, if you were expecting development, don't expect to actually get it except in the most superficial way possible.
____
Whew. That was long. Alright, I'm done. I don't want to talk about the characters anymore.
ENJOYMENT: 3/10
I have mixed feelings because I feel differently for each story arc. The first one, I would probably give a solid 5/10, but the second one is more like a 1/10 because it offended me so much. 
I guess that averages out to a 3/10, so I'll stick with it.
_____
OVERALL: 3/10
If I average all my scores together, it's actually a 4, but I'm lowering it one more point because I hated the Alfheim arc so much. If it was just the Aincrad arc, I would ease up and give the show a 5/10, but the second arc just utterly destroyed that, didn't it? 
Sorry, but no dice SAO. Congrats on being the worst anime I've seen all the way through, though.
In conclusion:
- One point for Klein
- One point for the animation
- One point for the voice acting
PS- I'm really sorry if you read my unedited, ranty, angry spoilery review.
_____
BONUS SECTION: HOW SWORD ART ONLINE COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD
A) Cut out the Alfheim arc out all together, instead have all 25 episodes be about Aincrad.
B) Have a protagonist who isn't a Gary Stu. Have interesting, nuanced characters whose relationships are well developed instead of just skimmed over.
C) Take time to develop the plot. In fact, have a complex, progressive plot instead of random episodic filler.
D) Have good female characters who aren't written in a sexist and insulting way.
and
E) Klein is either the main character instead or has a lot more screen time.",3

                So yeah, it's a shonen genre that is MONOGAMOUS.  The world is ending.
That aside, watching this series after years away from shonen anime has made me realize that the genre, or should I say the shonen subgenre of the anime genre, is undergoing a serious change.
By the way, be advised, that after writing the whole thing and reviewing  it, I realize that it has turned into more of an essay and in-depth discussion on the anime genre, rather than a simple review, so only read if that interests you.
I'm giving this anime a pretty mediocre score, and I believe that many others have
                  also given it less-than-excellent scores, ranging from mediocre to abysmal.  At the core of the issue, I think, is the PACING.  There is no way to sugarcoat the fact that this show had terrible, terrible pacing.  Years ago, when I was into huge, drawn-out behemoths  of shows like Bleach and Naruto, I thought those had pacing issues.  But no, Sword Arts Online has pacing  issues.
My first thought after I had seen a couple of episodes and gotten a general grasp of the show's premise, its world, it's characters, and its tone, the first thing I  thought was ""there are only 20-something episodes?"" 
You see, SAO was meant  to  be, and should be, a painfully milked-out, overdrawn, over-dramatized grindfest stretching for hundreds of episodes, in the spirit of the Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach franchises.  Now, you can probably discern from my choice of words that I don't exactly hold such franchises in the loftiest artistic esteem, but at least they are what they are.   Sure, single story arc, nay a single fight, can stretch into painful dozens of episodes of ""my sword is bigger and cooler than yours,"" but at least we get to be intimately acquainted with every minute aspect of the show, ranging from the over-large cast of characters enough to populate a small town, each of the special abilities, all the different locations, etc. etc.  Getting immersed in a vibrant new world is the joy of watching shonen series, right?
I haven't watched an episode of Naruto and Bleach  in, I  don't  know, 4-5 years? And I still remember KAGE BUNSHIN NO JUTSU!!!! and GETSUGA TENSOUUUU in the exact  voice and intonation they were respectively invoked in.  I watched ALL of SAO overnight last night, and the only names I remember from the show are: Kirito,  Asuna, Suguha, and that's it.
I mean, it's a show about MMORPG, for god's sake, it was MEANT to be milked out.  The thing about MMO's is that there is a lot, I mean A LOT, of content.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of enemies, equipment, items, and skills in each game, and the thing is, a player somehow ends up knowing every single one of those by the time his character starts wearing more than hardened leather for armor.  That is the magic of grinding.  With the premise of SAO, us watchers should have rejoiced with Kirito every time he took 30 episodes to complete a single quest to gain a shiny new sword, and the fan forums should've been abuzz for weeks about  how awesome that new sword is, how it compares to that one other cool sword in the series, etc.  We  should've gone all fanboy, when Asuna finally mastered a flashy new technique after episodes and episodes of training, interspersed with being all depressed about how she was too weak to protect Kirito, etc (actually, the last bit's sarcasm;  we can probably do without all the tearful WATASHIWA MAMORU scenes Amen).
That, i think, is the essence of the changes that are taking place in the Japanese shonen scene.  Perhaps it's indicative of the hard times the Japanese economy is going through, but it seems that the investors and developers are wary of diving headlong into these big, decade-spanning, moneycow  franchises that resulted in DBZ, One Piece, etc.  I can't think of very many of those springing up in the last few years, other than the ones that were already ongoing.  FMA Brotherhood, maybe? No, the manga series was already done, so it had no more coming.  I seem to remember  Ao no Exorcist starting to become something of a flagship franchise, until the developers VERY CONSPICUOUSLY decided to walk out on in right in the middle of the show.  It's like, if a few years ago, they saw a popular and promising manga, they were like ""how can we turn this into the biggest, most culturally-pervasive franchise we possibly can and milk as much cash from it as logically possible,"" these days they're like ""Oh, this manga/light novel is quite popular these days.  You think we can do a  modest, 24-episode quickie on it and come out with a reasonable, well-calculated profit?""  
As always, I'm in the danger of over-extrapolating and delving into the realm of international economics, where I definitely do not belong.  But I lament that SAO really had the potential to become the Naruto, Bleach, One Piece of few years and hundreds of episodes later.  It's very premise of an MMORPG gives it free reign for virtually limitless milking-out.  Each boss of every 100 floors of just the first world could have been written into its own story arc going longer than the entire SAO season itself.  Hell, if they suffered the quintessential problem of the anime catching up with the original light novels, they could just sneak in a filler season or two as some side quest, and no one would even notice.  It would definitely start to feel drawn-out, but fans would no doubt continue to watch, as  long as they gave us a sweet new piece of equipment or flashy new skill every now and then; that is the tested-and-proven formula of, not only shonen anime, but MMORPG itself.  And to be honest, I thought the characters themselves were quite likeable and had every bit of potential to grow into a solid shonen cast, just as much as the cast of Bleach or Fairy Tail,  given the right development.  It personally offends me that they could whip up a decent, enjoyable 100-episode show out of something like D.Gray-Man (like, years back), yet wasted this goldmine of a shonen series on a 25-episode mini show (yeah yeah, they're making a second season, whatever, whatever, DID YOU NOT READ ANYTHING I JUST WROTE?).  
Perhaps part of the problem is that those developers and investors are out of touch and do not trust power of the fanbase.  Just give the fans something to rave about, and they will carry the show more than any author's penmanship possibly can.  I mean, no offense, but since when were shows like Bleach watched and adored because of avant-garde writing style and quality of animation that constantly struggled to stay abreast of the constantly-evolving standards of anime?  No, just give us a cool new  world like SAO and ALfheim to play in, throw in some reasonably charming characters (which, the cast of  SAO certainly can be), and, in no time, fanbase will be built, the flames of ship wars will be fanned (doesn't matter if  KiritoXAsuna is so monogamously canon,  KiritoXSuzuha and dozens of other ship camps WILL rise up), fan fics and fan art will pour out, and memes will be created to immortalize the show on the internet boards.
On an ending note, I would probably not be its biggest fan, if SAO were to evolve into a Naruto-esque megafranchise, as the shonen genre just doesn't do it for me anymore, but, if this trend continues, I would sure feel sorry that the next generation of shonen-watchers wouldn't have something nice and easy and generic to grow up on before finding their more specific tastes.  I mean, I know, that if I didn't have shows like DBZ and Bleach to get me hooked to anime, I probably wouldn't have ended up enjoying the deeper, existentially-satisfying experiences like NGE and Bakemonogatari.",6

                Sword Art Online is an anime that I really wanted to like, and if you’re like me, and its premise sounded intriguing to you, then you probably wanted to like it, too. It takes a special kind of talent to take something with such potential and just utterly waste it. Going into it, I heard some pretty nasty things about it, and I kept asking myself “This can’t be THAT bad…… can it?” 
Unfortunately, my worst fears came true, and all I was met with was massive disappointment. 
-Story & Characters-
Taking place in the year of 2022, a hit new virtual-reality MMO is released: Sword
                  Art Online. By putting on a special helmet called a Nerve Gear, your subconscious goes into the game’s world, as if you yourself are in the game. On what seems like a typical day of grinding and fetch-questing, all goes wrong when the game’s creator, Akihiko Kaeba, announces that he removed the ability to log out, and will only allow them to leave when they complete a 100-floor dungeon, and also confirms that if the players’ HP reaches zero, the Nerve Gear will shock their brain and end up killing them. 
……Never explained why. 
This already sounds so awesome, right? It’s like Dot Hack, but even better…… at first. After the first four episodes, the story will plummet into a mishmash of nonsense, attempting to wrap up two years of time within the first fourteen episodes. Time skips seem to happen at every corner, making the story incredibly disjointed. One minute, the main character is level 40, the next episode, he’s level 70. What happened? Did anything of significance happen within that window of time? According to Sword Art Online, no, nothing did. This terrible pacing also affects another highly disappointing aspect of this anime: The characters. 
Our main character, Kirito, is your average teenage boy who likes to play videogames, just like the rest of us. Kirito isn’t a terrible character, per se, but he’s really just a copy-and-paste shounnen. He has no flaws, everyone loves him, and even develops his own harem (More on that later). Kirito is even able to break the MMO’s system through Deus Ex Machinas, simply because the writers couldn’t think of a logical way for Kirito to make it out of a predicament alive. One second, he’s fighting a losing battle, the next, he comes out on top and doesn’t even break a sweat, despite the MMO’s limitations. There was literally a scene where Kirito’s HP reached zero when he was fighting an epic duel. However, instead of dying, he comes back as an apparition and wins. It’s Kirito: Deal with it. 
During episode 2, he meets Asuna, our heroine and (blatantly forced) love interest. For a little bit less than halfway through the show, Asuna is portrayed as a strong, honorable, and (dare I say) total badass. However, after she and Kirito finally confess their feelings for each other in the sappiest, most melodramatic fashion possible, she becomes little more than a chirpy tsundere, and, during the show’s second half, she becomes Princess Peach, and Kirito’s goal is to save her from the clutches of the evil, horrible, bad man. 
The rest of the cast is hardly worth talking about, as they only come and go as the show demands. What could have worked as a dark story about what dying really is, we’re just thrown into various situations that lack any type of context. On more than one occasion, there will be dramatic death scenes of characters, where Kirito explains in a monologue why this person’s death is so tragic, yet, we know next to nothing about said character, aside from maybe their name. We’re merely told, not shown, which is a big no-no in storytelling. 
Speaking of which, the second half of the show is probably the biggest offender of this entire anime. Not only was everything completely resolved after episode 14, it ended on a relatively satisfactory note. I was confused as to why the show kept going, as the way that the show presented itself in episode 14’s conclusion implied its end. Had the show ended right then and there, I would have scored this anime slightly higher, but…… it continued. Kirito and the rest of the SAO players that managed to survive this ordeal finally wake up from their two year sleep and go on with their daily lives. Here, we see Kirito back at home, living his life as a normal, young teenager. However, Asuna, who just so happens to live around Kirito’s area and is just a train ride away, still hasn’t awoken from her slumber, and Kirito periodically visits her in the hospital. He eventually learns that a man with close connections to Asuna’s family plans to marry her, and demands that Kirito stay away from her. We later learn that he manipulated Asuna’s Nerve Gear so that her subconscious transfers her into another MMO, Alfheim Online. Kirito naturally won’t stand for this, so he borrows the game’s software from a friend, makes an account, and proceeds to save Princess Pea-, I mean, Asuna. What confused me was that this half of the show made me feel like I was watching something entirely different. In fact, it makes me wonder why the entire anime was titled “Sword Art Online”, as it only applied to the first 14 episodes. A more appropriate title for it would be something like “Getting Stuck in Two Virtual Reality MMO’s”. Not only that, in Alfheim Online, since the players can log out, the tension of the first half is gone entirely, making it lose its impact and making it hard to care. To the second half’s credit, there are no time skips, and it has a much better pace, which was what hurt the first half, and the secondary love interest, Suguha (Who is also Kirito’s cousin), was cute and likeable. Joy! We found a decent character in this pool of blandness! 
As mentioned before, during the second half of the show, Kirito all of a sudden develops his own harem. Girls all around Alfheim Online will meet and fall in love with him for literally no reason. What’s so special about him, anyway? It makes no sense at all. 
But wait! The flaws with the story don’t end there. As mentioned before, there are Deus Ex Machinas up the hizzy, but to add to the pile of “win”, why not throw in some plot holes, too? Akihiko Kaeba’s reason for trapping the players in the game is never explained. Except, oh wait, it IS explained: He can’t remember why he did it. Uh, right. But the most unintentionally hilarious Deus Ex Machina is when Kirito is cornered by a bunch of PK’s in Alfheim Online. Oh, no! What are you going to do, Kirito!? The logical thing to do, of course: Transform into a massive demon dragon, kill all of the PK’s, revert back to normal, and never mention it again! 
This
actually
happened. 
In conclusion, the entire story of this anime was just bad. Both halves of the show felt completely unrelated to each other, the second half was silly, and the characters were weak. Just a very poor story. 
-Visuals & Sound-
However, not all is bad in the world of Sword Art (Alfheim) Online. The show’s athletics are easily its highlight. The visuals and art style are absolutely phenomenal. The character models are brilliantly drawn, and have very solid animations. The backgrounds and environments look gorgeous, as well. 
Another highlight of the visuals are the fight scenes, which are breathtaking. Every sword clash, every magic spell, every item used: It all looks wonderful. The fight scenes are also incredibly well-directed, with the way that the camera cinematically swoops around the action and zooms up when the characters get closer and closer as they run up to each other. A-1 Pictures should be proud of themselves. 
The audio is equally strong. I watched the show dubbed (I prefer to watch anime that way), and I was not disappointed. Bryce Papenbrook does a stellar job as Kirito, and gives him more personality than he actually has, and the rest of the cast is equally well-acted. Going over how brilliantly well-acted everyone is will take me all day. 
As for the music, well…… It’s Yuki Kajiura: Do I even have to say anything? Being the mastermind behind the soundtracks of Kara no Kyoukai, Madoka Magica, and Fate/Zero, Yuki Kajiura delivers her strongest soundtrack yet. Ranging from emotional piano pieces, to epic scores, to beautifully orchestrated tracks, this is one soundtrack that I whole-heartedly recommend buying, even at full price: You must listen to this soundtrack, and if you don’t, you’re doing yourself a disservice. 
-Conclusion-
Despite its top-notch visuals, epic fight scenes, great voice acting, and amazing soundtrack, these aesthetics can’t save this anime. The laughably bad story, terrible pacing, and highly underdeveloped characters are this show’s biggest downfall, and the entire anime is terrible because of it. If you don’t care about the awful story, and the aesthetics are enough to hold your attention, then maybe you can have some fun with it, but that’s all they are: Aesthetics. I need more. 
Do yourself a favor: Listen to the soundtrack and give this one a pass. 
+Stellar production values
+Epic fight scenes
+Top-notch dub
+ Yuki Kajiura: ‘Nuff said
-Horrible story
-Terrible pacing during the show’s first half
-Plot holes and Deus Ex Machinas galore 
-Second half is silly and feels like it has nothing to do with the first half
-Annoying, whiney villain in the second half
-Asuna starts off as a great heroine, but devolves into a typical anime tsundere 
-Forced romance
-Underdeveloped, bland cast
-Wasted potential

                **May Contain Spoilers up to Episode 10**
One of my friends recommended Sword Art Online to me and I have to say I was not disappointed. SAO is definitely up there in what I believe to be top anime, deserved to be at least given a try by everyone who watches anime.
I'm just going to say now that I have not read either the Light Novels or Manga in advance, so this review is strictly from a newcomer to the series point of view. I've also only seen up to episode 10 so far, so this may change in the future.
--Introduction--
Having looked at many of the
                  reviews on both this website and others, I have to say, there is a massive discrepancy between low scored and high scored reviews. I'm talking many reviews between the 1-3 range and 8-10 range. There seems to be no middle ground, which suggests that SAO is an anime that you either love or hate, kind of like Fight Club if anyone has seen that film. To a sense, this is kind of correct as many of the nostalgic gaming references that are hidden within the show can't be seen by just anyone. To fully enjoy this show, you should of at least played one MMORPG, before you can understand this show clearly.
--Story--
The plot revolves around the near future, around about 10 to 12 years where technology that allows people to immerse themselves with their senses into a video game has been developed. To accompany this, a new game not too surprisingly called ""Sword Art Online"" was released to 10000 players after being alpha and beta tested. Main protagonist Kirito is one of the players and also one of the 1000 beta testers and logs in on the release day, only to find that the creator has locked all players in the game with no way to log out. Any attempt to disconnect the nerve gear as the series calls it will result in the player's real body's brain being fried. The only way to escape is to clear all 100 floors of the game, which serves as the fundamentals for the primary plot  of the show.
One of the problems I had with the series when I began watching was the pacing. The first 7 or so episodes take place within a time span of two years, which feels far too quick. Before being told that these were just side stories, I thought Kirito and the other protagonist Asuna were going to remain in this game for a LONG LONG time. I'm talking around 5 to 10 years. 
The sidestories themselves are actually decent, they introduce us to the characters we will be seeing throughout the show. They also develop and show us who they all are and what their personalities are. Although the characters will develop even further, especially the main ones, Kirito and Asuna.
However, now that the main plot has finally begun, it's quite frankly excellent, even within the first two ""main"" episodes. Time will only tell if it gets better. The only problem I had with this was the pacing, which still remained far too quick. It feels as if almost the producers were trying to cram 100 pages of writing into a 20 minute episode. It probably would of been best to slow down the story and spread out the plot, but I'm guessing this is due to budget problems. 
It's hardly a spoiler that there is a romance brewing between the two main protagonists, Kirito and Asuna. This romance however is well done and brings tears to the emotional ones and even wrenches a bit of heart from the stone cold viewers. Some people may say the romance is clearly aimed towards girls, but I disagree. In a plot like this, where death can grapple onto you at any time, the characters need some sort of humanity in them, something to keep fighting for. The actions that both these players take is completely understandable, even if it breaks moral code, you feel sympathetic towards them. I found myself asking myself what I would do if I was in Kirito's situation, knowing that I could die any day, but just to experience the warmth of another person, can mean so much to the characters in their tragic circumstances.
Score: 9
--Art--
The art direction of the show is very good. The characters have a realistic shape compared to the extremely slim and tall properties of Code Geass characters. Not all male characters are portrayed as muscly and strong and the females actually have realistic bodies. It's relieving to see that they don't all consist of big breasts. The environment that surrounds Aincrad is excellent, I feel as if i was actually in an MMORPG.
My only problem is some of the animation within this series. Most notably during the fight scenes, it isn't smooth at all, not like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which has some of the greatest fighting I've seen, up there with Samurai Champloo. It's a shame as an anime that must have fighting as one of it's main points falls in this department.
Score: 8
Sound/Music
The music in SAO is a masterpiece. At appropriate times, it sets the mood perfectly, whether it be tension and action music during fights (which is arguably some of the best battle music I've heard in a LONG time), or emotional  music during scenes with conflict and tragedy. Usually the openings of anime are skipped, but I found myself watching the opening over and over again, even after I finished the episode. It's so damn addictive and can get glued to your head easily.
Score: 10
--Characters--
Definitely one of the strong points in this series. The characters are some of the best I've seen since Fullmetal Alchemist, and their unique in their way too. The cliche male protagonist being weak and whiny thankfully isn't here. Many of us gamer who watch this show can relate ourselves to the characters in this show. Kirito for example is shown at the very start to be a socially awkward person who excels at video games, something some of us can definitely relate to. 
Asuna, the other protagonist is awesome in a way that cannot be described, but only shown. She's a cute and pretty girl playing an MMORPG, which is especially rare in real life. Girls who play MMORPG's are almost virtually non existence as they tend to hide their gender for danger of being flamed or accused of being a guy. It is because of this that Asuna is a symbol of the female gamers out there who deserve to be treated as human as others.
Although they have not been given a lot of screen time yet, the side characters are surprisingly well done, despite their lack of development so far. We know who they are and we have a good idea of what role they play in the journey that Kirito and Asuna take.
Score: 10
--Summary--
Sword Art Online is one of the best anime series' I've seen since Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The fact that I'm a hardcore gamer only strengthens my love for this show. The highs and lows that these characters will experience carry the themes and story of the show. The plot is beginning to reveal it's true self and the characters are that amazing that they alone is enough to watch this show. That being said, the show is not for everyone, there are many things in here that either you will love or hate, as there is no middle ground. It's almost close to being a masterpiece, but isn't quite there yet.
Give it a go, I'm sure you'll like it.

                Story: 6
What starts off to be a promising starting point in terms of how we are introduced to the overall story but this soon goes downhill and things get a bit cliche. The initial impression is that players of a vrmmorpg are unable to log out and are forced to go through 100 floors to beat the game and escape, catch is when someone dies in-game they die for real and never come back. I enjoyed this problem that the players were faced with, because with this it would allow the watcher to become more immersed and allow for a deeper understanding on the value
                  of life and death which they were faced with. However one of the early problems that appeared was the time-skips that happened in the anime, which seemed to be to sudden and became evident later on that they did this because they were rushing things and never really told the audience what exactly happened or what was going to happen. Another problem was lack of tension or challenges faced, which affected the whole ""death"" factor, as Kirito and company just seemed to somehow come on top in the end, sure there was that one moment were he faced struggles while with that guild he temporarily joined but besides that they make it seem like he's struggling but in the end comes on top and really becomes a predictable outcome most of the time. Another Issue I had was the second arc, which was the alfeim arc, this whole arc seemed kinda pointless, yes they were saving asuna (aka princess peach) but they again rarely faced struggles and for some reason tried to have the whole incest crap going on, like Saguha was basically just another cardboard cutout and was your generic tsundere character. Overall the story had potential, yet failed to execute at crucial times and became predictable and lacked some tension. 
Art: 8
This is one of the areas were the anime excelled, the animation was truly stunning at times, whether it was watching the environment and background  or seeing how good it was during the fights which made the anime more appealing to the eyes. Not the best animation I've seen but it is definitely one of the anime's strong points.
Sound: 8
Another strong point to the anime. The first opening's and ending were very enjoyable and definitely made watching the 90 seconds of it worth it, the second opening and ending were alright but not memorable like the first ones were. The Japanese and English actors were also very good, in both versions the voice actors did an exceptional job even though the Japanese version was the better one, the English was definitely enjoyable however. Overall a very enjoyable opening and ending with some good soundtracks to suit the situation and the voice acting was also a strong point.
Characters: 3 
This was definitely one of the most disappointing areas of the anime. The characters overall lacked diversity and were very generic in most cases. The Protagonist Kirito was your classic ""lone wolf"" who people seemed to look up to and acted too much like a ""knight in shining armor"" and for some reason he was hailed a prestigious figure just because he was a beta player, like seriously, someone trying to solo dungeons never works and you usually go in parties most of the time and being a beta player doesn't make you somehow better than other players. Your main Heroine Asuna started off promisingly and seemed to be more than just a damsel in distress and was able to cope by herself, but it all went downhill fast when her relationship with kirito started, she started to rely on her boyfriend (aka ""Knight in shining armor"") all the time, she also spent majority of the second arc stuck in a cage, which affected her character development a lot. Most of the other characters were cardboard cutouts and mostly had 1-2 episodes before the were quickly forgotten and cast to the side. The two antagonist's in the story also lacked a bit of creativity, the first who seemed like a mystery man and we had very little information on, besides the fact he was the creator and was the one who trapped them in the game, without any real motive. The second was Sogou, a man that was elected to marry Asuna and one of the prestigious players in Alfeim Online, he was fairly one-dimensional. your classic bad guy who has an obsession with the main heroine and seemed to be power hungry. Overall the characters were fairly One-Dimensional and lacked creativity, which was very disappointing considering I had high hopes while watching it.
Enjoyment: 5
Overall:6
The anime is fairly average and considering how popular it is, some would say it is overrated, which is a fair point considering the amount of quality anime that don't get the credit they deserve. The anime has great sound and art but lacks in the important areas of the story and especially the characters. So giving it a 6 is probably generous but that doesn't make it not worth watching, however it is far from a masterpiece.",6
"
                Sword Art Online is one of the most discussed animes of all time, with a lot of people being split into two camps, those who defend it and act as if it lacks flaws, and those who will do anything to show that it is one of the worse animes of all time. I know loads of people who cosplay this show and adore this. I feel that Sword Art Online may not be the worst anime of all time, but it has flaws that run extremely deep.
Part 1: Aincrad Arc.
Story: 1/10
I feel as if this whole anime's story was a huge waste of potential.
                   This first arc covers the first 15 episodes of this anime, and about 4 of them have any plot development in them. I think the makers were very confused about what story they actually want to tell here, the first two episodes imply the show is about a video game death game where people have to fight with stories, but really the majority of the show is not about that. Really it is a romance set in a video game world, where the male romantic lead is distracted by other women at the start. There are a number of pointless episodes about side characters that takes the story no where. 
If you were judging the show on the first two episodes, it would seem as if it were going to be extremely good, but it goes off on a tangent, that nothing can really pull it back from. In the last few episodes they pull it back onto the whole defeating the death game thing, but by this point it is really too late.
I find another huge problem with the story is the way that is told, the viewer is not shown thing, but rather told. We are told Kirito saves this certain guild, we do not see it, we are told 2000 players die, we do not see this. Telling the viewer instead of showing is lazy.
I will pull setting into this as well. Most good RPGS have a brilliant world, this one, not quite. It is meant to have 100 different floors which are all unique, the first floor is the only one that gets any real development, and even then, it looks like a bland, stereotypical medieval-fantasy setting. 
Art: 7/10 This anime was made by A-1 pictures, known for their work on Fairy Tail, Ano Hana and other popular animes, their art here is not the best that they have ever done, there is nothing overtly wrong with it, the costume designs are nice, but the direction is bland and most of the characters have very similar looking faces. 
Sound: 6/10 The music is composed by Yuki Kajiura, famous for her work on the soundtracks of the '//Hack series and Madoka Magica. The music is SAO is passable, but nowhere near her best work. Some of the battle themes are pretty good, but a lot of it is extremely bland and forgettable.
I watched the English dub of this show, and it wasn't great, Kirito sounds bland (though I guess it suits the character), Asuna is irritatingly nasal sounding and most of the cast sounds as if they were not really trying.
Character: 1/10. I feel this to be the show's main weakness. As SAO is more of a romance story than an action show, the viewer would expect the main couple to be interesting characters, but they aren't.
Kirito: Gary Stu and a half. Kirito must be one of the worst protagonists ever, he is so bland. His dialogue is uninteresting and uninspired, he is either explaining the mechanics of the game, stating his love for Asuna, or being angry. His morals are bland and white, never doing anything that the viewer would disagree with.
He makes a big deal of being a solo player, when he is usually in a guild or teamed up with someone, so this is just pointless.
He is more powerful than all of the other players and it is never really explained why. All of the female players fall in love with him, despite the fact that there are probably way more male players in the game, and the girls would have the pick of them.
He is never made out to be interesting, he is just over powered and extremely boring.
All the women love him, villains are jealous of him, and all the guys want to be him. He is wish fulfillment garbage.
Asuna: More wasted potential here, initially she seems mysterious and strong, she could have been one of the few strong female characters in modern anime, but the makers screwed her character over and made her a tsundere waifu to Kirito. Her whole purpose is to make Kirito look even stronger and more amazing.
Silica: Token loli, she falls in love with Kirito.
Lisbeth: Falls in love with Kirito.
Klein: He could have been an interesting character, but his is dropped early into the series, and crops up occasionally, never leaving an impact.
Villain 1: I won't spoil who it is, but he has no motivation to speak of, rendering the ending spectacle without the payoff. 
Enjoyment: With plotholes, pointless fanservice in serious scenes, and no pay off at the end. The plot goes all over the place, focusing on a bland guy having a bland romance with a bland girl, meaning that I did not enjoy this show.
Arc 2: This arc gets bashed even by fans of the first arc, but I did not see what was meant to be so much worse about this arc in comparison to the first one.
Story 1/10: I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but the plotting of this arc actually seemed slightly better than the first arc, with Kirito not wandering off and doing as many random side quests as he does in the first one.
Character: Kirito's sister: Again, could have been a semi decent character, instead she is fanservice and falls in love with Kirito.
Side Villain: I have no idea why this guy was in it, so pointless.
Main villain: hilariously bad, the first guy had no motivation, this guy is just a pantomime villain with a hair fetish.
Enjoyment: This arc is more funny-bad, with the first arc being just bad. the second arc also has incest and tentacle rape, if you like that kind of thing.
Overall: 2/10
There is little to enjoy in this show, unless you like fanservice and bland romances. I had someone I know say that he watched it for the sword fights, there are like 4 in the whole show, go watch Rose of Versailles or Chevalier D'eon for sword fights, not this.
This show has no respect for the intelligence of the viewer, Kirito is over powered, and there are so many asspulls. It would be okay to enjoy this show as a guilty pleasure, but never for one minute pretend that it is good.",2

                When I finished SAO not long ago, I was, I must admit, very confused. I'd just seen an anime full of faults and holes and yet I found myself being entertained beyond my expectations. I've been searching for a way to best describe that anime and how the hell is it possible to like something with so many shortcomings so much, when the perfect thought hit me whilst chewing on a burger at some obscure booth near a bus station.
SAO is exactly like a cheap cheeseburger. You know it's nothing special and that most of the ingredients' quality is questionable at best, yet the huge
                  amount of good sauce they add drowns everything else out and, as long as you like the sauce, you find yourself enjoying every bite and licking your fingers clean.
If you haven't stopped reading my review despite of my rather cheesy (heh heh) metaphor, I guess you won't mind me sticking to it while I get to the bottom of things and write a bit about each of the aspects of the anime
1. Story - the meat: 6
SAO's plot makes me think of someone getting a really fine chunk of beef, nice and juicy... and then not really being able to prepare it well. I loved the idea for SAO even before I started watching and some of the plot twists that happened later on I found very involving... but there were just too many shortcomings and a great potential was, for the most part, lost. The pacing was very chaotic, the romance motif was nauseating at times and the introduction of the second arc was incredibly cumbersome and just seemed forced. Thankfully, it got a bit better after the initial ""shock"" and in the end I guess it wasn't a bad arc (I found Sugu's story to be surprisingly touching), but still it could've been executed better. Bottom line is, SAO's story was like an apetizingly looking patty with good taste, but chewy and with plenty undercooked spots.
2. ART - the bun: 10
Just like when eating a cheeseburger, the first thing you sink your teeth into when watching an anime is the art style... and SAO's art style is really, really good - fresh from the bakery. The background scenery is breathtaking, the character designs - interesting and the fight scenes - beautifully animated. This is the only aspect of the anime I honestly have no issues with, which I guess is a good thing but then again, if the best part of your burger is the bun, you might as well just get yourself a peanut-butter-jelly sandwich instead.
3. MUSIC - the cheese: 9
Like delicious cheese that melts and seeps through the rest of the burger, the music in SAO is truly spectacular. It might not be anything extremely ambitious from a musical point of view, but then few anime OSTs can be called true masterpieces. What the soundtrack should do is make uplifting moments more uplifting, touching scenes more touching and epic fights more epic. SAO does a really good job in incorporating the music into the action and it plays a huge part in building the represented world of the game and well, basically, if the main theme didn't have you swinging a non-existent sword while Kirito was kicking ass then, well, you're probably lactose intolerant.
The opening and ending songs were very fitting to the anime as well (I particularly enjoyed the second ED) and the VAs also did a great job, so in terms of music I have little complaints. Even if you don't like SAO, you gouda at least admit it has a good soundtrack.
4. CHARACTER - the veggies: 4
Oh man. I don't want to go into rant mode, so I'll just say that the characters, for the most part, are like a bunch of frozen vegetables with hardly any taste quickly thawed and carelessly slopped into the burger. OK, they're not impossible to like, but all it takes is to chew on them for a little bit longer to analyze them more and they fall apart, mostly being water.
Seriously though, the characters are definitely SAO's weakest point. I didn't read the light novel but I've heard that the anime really waters their personalities down. (Yeah sorry, I'll rant for a bit, please bear with me) The main character, Kirito, is your typical quiet yet OP protagonist who struggles with many personal issues. He's the type of character that's meant to be so likable and relatable that there's hardly any interesting personality in him left. That can be sort of overlooked, I mean in an adventure anime that concentrates mostly on entertaining the viewer, that kind of character usually works, but what really irks me is that nearly every female character in the anime has a thing for him, which is annoying. That brings us to Asuna, the main female character or, as I like to think of her, waifu template. Quiet and badass at first, like Kirito, later on she becomes quite the opposite when she falls for Kirito and turns into a hopelessly love-struck plot-device girlfriend which hardly suits her character (I don't even think that's a spoiler, with both of them being arguably the most popular anime pair. If it's a spoiler, forgive me... but really, it's obvious from the first moment). Also a character that is possible to like... but hard to appreciate.
I could go on about each and every one of the characters, but that would take to long. Basically, the characters have little depth, the second antagonist is evil to the point of being ridiculous (he literally licks up someone's tears at one point, I'm not even kidding), the secondary characters - interesting, begging for some character development and much more likable than the main cast (at least for me. And at least Liz) - appear and disappear at the writers' whim and it may be hard to get attached to them for some viewers. Basically... yeah. The only character that I'd say got a decent amount of development and depth was Suguha in the second story arc. Her and Kirito's relation, though I had doubts at first (you'll see what I mean), turned out to be really touching. Sugu is basically a slice of fresh and juicy tomato among the watery main characters and not-yet-thawed secondary characters.
Bottom line is, the anime would arguably be more entertaining with no characters at all c:
5. ENJOYMENT - the sauce: 9
The secret ingredient, the sauce that the SAO cheeseburger is literally swimming in is what makes it worth checking out... and what made me love it.
Like I said at the beginning... SAO has it's faults. Quite a few of them. But if you like adventure, action, romance and comedy and begin to watch SAO with an open mind and not expecting the best animu evar... you'll find it hard to really hate it.
It's just... incredibly fun to watch. You might roll your eyes or facepalm a few times during the entire series (especially during the fanservice moments), but the story is involving, the fight scenes paired with the music simply epic and the whole anime, that big greasy cheeseburger, incredibly satisfying.
If you've stuck through this entire gastronomical review, you have my respect and thanks. If you're here, please allow me to just add my personal opinion: I don't care if an anime has mediocre pacing, characters lacking depth or cheesiness. I want animes to entertain me, to suck me in, to make me cheer on the main character while they destroy their enemies to save the one they love. SAO did just that. I have my issues with it, but I still love it. And so might you, so disregard everything both good or bad you've heard about it (though if you do, then technically this review is pointless D: ) and just give it a go and see for yourself.",7

____________
Story
This whole anime series feels like it's the fantasy where almost every girl falls head over heels with a boy in such a short time? The romance of this series was just too rushed, I couldn't even see HOW Asuna even liked Kirito in the first place. ""Oh, you saved me, I love you!"", seriously?
Character
Character development was way too rushed or just too simple.
They are way too perfect and or overpowered. Was the author afraid to kill off some major characters? *shrug*
Enjoyment
Out of the 25 episodes, most of them are like filler episodes, completely irrelevant to the story line. Despite so, it's too plain or easily predicted.
Art & Sound
Both are decent, I don't have any particular critique for this.
Overall
Like harem anime? Then SAO is for you! A typical storyline where girls fall in love with one boy, leaving the rest to be forever alone.
-
I would not recommend to anyone, sadly. It's just too plain. I didn't even get attached to any characters.",3

                This review is for people wondering if they should watch the show. I'm not going to summarize the story because you have a synopsis already given to you.
Story:9
The story was great in my opinion. I actually didn't like the summary of the show because it reminded me of .hack, which is a good show, but it does not have a plot that interests me nowadays. Don't let the synopsis scare you away! I would like to add that during the beginning, the episodes are filler-like. Each episode had a different story, but the point of this way of story telling was to show how the
                  life of being trapped in a game would be. At first, I was even finding it hard to believe that this show was going to be about romance.
Art: 8
Not much to talk about in the art style of this show. The art deserved a 9/10 because of the many eye pleasing scenery. However, character design of the later half of the show had some negative feedback, which forces me to drop the score.
Sound: 8
The opening and ending music were good. During the show, I actually enjoyed the background music. Not much to complain about.
Characters: 7
The characters were good, but nothing great. The protagonist is a quiet strong type. Not wanting to have people slow him down, he becomes a solo player and the strongest player of the server. The female protagonist of this show was great, but... maybe too great. She's the typical beauty, who is good at every thing. She's strong, she cooks great, and comes from a wealthy family. Both characters were great and had almost no flaws, which makes them seem like they have no personality at all.
Enjoyment: 9/10
I enjoyed this show very much. I loved it. Every Saturday, I would get off from work happy because I knew a new episode of Sword Art Online was waiting for me. It had a good mix or romance, combat, and story.
Overall: 9/10
This show is great. Why do I see people giving this show 2/10's or 5/10's is beyond me. If I were to put myself in a hater's perspective, I wouldn't even find the strength to give this show any less than a 7. Maybe they didn't enjoy the show because it didn't follow closely to the light novel, I don't know. Maybe it was because this show is a harem in disguise. The only complaint I have for this show was the action. Don't get me wrong, I love the fight scenes, but the show didn't have enough of them! If they added 2-3 more fights in this show, I would've probably given it a perfect 10.",9

                Sword Art online is...weird. Its not a particularly great anime, but I really enjoyed myself throughout the entire journey, even the much-hated Alfheim Online portion that almost everybody I know hates with a passion. I really can't place a finger on what made Sword Art Online so great for me, but I will try to explain why I think it is a valued watch for any fan of anime.
The story itself is overall okay, but the Aincrad portion (first half of the anime) is the highlight. The situation of ""you die in the game, you die in real life"" made the possibility of your favourite
                  character being slain by one of the few (unfortunately) floor bosses faced by Kirito and his crew a very real and painful one. This made the defeat of the main villain something that you really wanted and made me want to route for the good guys. However, the ending falls a little flat and is feels like it was an afterthought, with 'game breaking' things happening that don't really make any sense. The Alfheim Online portion is not nearly as good as Aincrad's. The fairy setting wasn't nearly as appealing to me as the fantasy setting of Aincrad, and because there was not threat of actually dying, all the actions of the characters had little to no weight behind them, the only consequence being that the characters would re spawn a little farther away (oh no? how terrible?). The main villain is well done, however, and you will very quickly be anticipating the moment Kirito gets to enact his revenge. 
I really enjoyed the art style of SAO. It used very little CGI and the backgrounds all felt hand-done. It all lent to the feeling that these 'worlds' were massive digital creations, full of both beautiful and terrifying locations. The character designs were well done; each character in the main party had a distinct way of dressing that made them instantly recognizable. Overall, I have no complaints about the art in this anime. 
There are no memorable tracks in SAO, save the title sequence from the Aincrad story arc. I found that many of the tracks were dull and reused far too often. The sounds effects were acceptable and the voice acting was more that acceptable, but the sound design here is nothing to shout about.
The characters...Hmm...They're kinda bad. They are definitely the worst part of the anime and I think they are one of the reasons that many don't like SAO. While the characters are admittedly memorable, they have NO depth whatsoever, and none of them go through any kind of character development. Kirito is the worst: he is always more powerful than anything else in the anime and he has next to no flaws. It's very upsetting because the extensive list of side characters have a lot of potential with their unique personalities to help Kirito evolve a little bit, however there's nothing to evolve to because he's already the most powerful thing in either SAO or Alfhiem Online. The Romance between Asuna and Kirito also has very little weight behind it, as it basically takes two episodes to evolve from nothing to full fledged marriage. The best character in terms of actual development in Kirito's sister (kinda) Suguha, and I thoroughly enjoyed her evolving relationship with Kirito. I just wish the other characters had anywhere near as much depth as her, and I will freely admit that the Characters are by far the weakest part of SAO.
For some reason, even though my review has been mostly negative, I really liked SAO. I can't really explain why, but I think that it really is worth a watch. I think that the Aincrad story arc alone is worth a watch by any casual anime fan. Whether you watch the rest of the series, however, is up to you. I found that the entire experience was enjoyable, while many others would completely disagree with me. I think it is a personal thing, and to find out you should watch the first episode at least to try it out. Either way, it gets my recommendation with an overall 8.",8

                Sao has two arcs
The first arc is awesome cuz its an episodic Slice of life with action scenes. Think of Mushishi trying to be a shounen with a 10 years old being the main charater. Score:9/10
The second arc  is the clichéd good old story from the 80-90's where the girl gets catched by a pervert old man and our hero has to rescue her. But it has incest, hentai tentacles, and a harem. There are no words to describe it. Score: 10/10
9+10/2=9.5 (10) masterpiece XD

                Sword Art Online had a lot of potential with it's premise, don't get me wrong, but it infuriates me how much of that potential was squandered. The first few episodes of full of promise and excitement and show off a fascinating world full of high stakes and incredible challenges. However, this does not last, as the rest of the first half of SAO simply drags on, with hardly any focus on the original goal in the show.
 The filler-ish episodes, AKA the majority of the first half of the series isn't a complete waste, however. The world SAO takes place in is a pleasant world
                  to explore. I say if you want to watch this show, watch it for its world building along with its art and music, as those three aspects are the best SAO has to offer.
The characters are bland and dull. Kirito is your standard super-cool hero with little substance to him, Asuna's just another tsundere, and the rest of the cast are simply tired archetypes that bring nothing new to the table.
Now, most of what I have been saying until now applied to the first half of the show only. The second half of SAO changes things up in a way that sucks all the stakes and fun from the show. DOn't watch it.
I apologize if I sound too harsh on this show. Sword Art Online's fist half  IS a good anime to watch when you want to see something cool and fun, but by the second half it becomes dull and tedious and a little bit gross. Overall, watch the first half with friends and some popcorn, pretend the second doesn't exist.",6

                I haven't read the light novels, but as past anime have proven, light novel adaptations sometimes have simple plots and bad writing.
In comparison to this stereotype, I think Sword Art Online's plot was pretty good.
Story:
The story was very nice in my opinion. As a gamer, I would like a plot like this (involving video-games that may possibly exist in the future). The starting of the anime was just how it should have been. What I mean by that is that they explore the game, level up, train skills, etc., this is what most gamers do once they  get a new game. What I really
                  like about this story is the way the story was set up. If this was about a virtual world and their adventures, we would think of it that way. For example, if someone dies, we would not care because it is a game after all, they could re-spawn or revive. If someone does a ""heroic"" deed such as block a bullet for them of pushing them out of a way of a boss's attack, we would not be too sympathetic towards the character because it is just a game. When Akihiko Kayaba trapped them all in the game and made their deaths in the game apple to real life, it gave us a more serious way to look at it. When they die, it would mean more to us. My only problem with the anime is that the pacing change kind got me confused. I thought I was on the wrong episode and thought I went far ahead in the anime. Other than that I do not have a problem with it The first arc of the anime was really good. The action was well developed in my opinion. The second arc was not as good as the first arc, however it did add a lot of emotion. The second arc did not have as much action as the first arc but it was still pretty good. The Romance in this anime went a little too fast for me, the just had one kiss then all of a sudden and then things get ""rushed."" Overall, the story, was not bad.
Art:
The animation was great, it really connected to the anime itself, when they get wounded and it shows that grid instead of blood was pretty cool. Not to mention is was really colorful so it connects with the game itself. I honestly think the character design in the second arc could have been done better as well as the bosses in the first arc. Besides  that, it looked pretty awesome
Sound:
The openings and Endings were really good, the soundtracks gave a lot of hype and worked well with he anime and the battle within it. 
Character:
The characters were done nicely, to an extent. 
	Kirito was just an average gamer who likes spending most of his time in the virtual world. He was not too close to the family so he spent most of his time in his room. He had a background of a computer nerd you can say. He is also an amazing gamer with God-like MMO abilities. He is really good at the game itself and help some players out while in there. He is pretty decent when it comes to personality. He is not really a team player, he likes to play alone, calls himself a ""solo player"". The ladies love him. I think they did a good job developing the character as he progresses though the story. I wish they explain more about his past though, I was really curious about that and it would have been nice to watch
	Asuna is the love interest for Kirito. She takes 2nd in command of a powerful clan in the game and assist Kirito. Not a lot of background was said about her, I wish it would show her past, why she got into games or her past with the second villain of the anime. In the first arc she helped Kirito a lot with his quest, she even temporarily left her clan to be with him. In the second arc, she did not really do anything for reason I cannot reveal.
	Yui was an AI that has acquired human feelings. Kirito and Asuna found her in the woods alone. She was really cool since she could help Kirito and Asuna out with their quest. She is like a little Cheat since she can detect players and tell whether something is wrong or not. Some people call Kirito a Cheater when using Yui, he is just simply using his resources. 
	Suguha is Kazuto's (Kirito) little sister. She appears more in the second arc. She helps Kirito with his Quest to help Asuna. She her background was well explained in the anime, it really does catch up to how the story. She has a lot of emotion when it comes to her brother. Although, the way her character played out in the second arc was very well.
	The other character played their roles nicely as well, they added a little comedy or conflict here and there. Even the more important people ones interacted the main character time from time adding more interest.
Enjoyment:
This was a very good anime for me. The thing I enjoyed the most is Yui. She is so Kawaii!!!!! 
The way she call Kirito and Asuna Mommy and Daddy is adorable, yet kind of sad at the same time. The story itself was very emotional. It was really sad when the player died in the Dungeon and them committing suicide. I would like to explain more, However, that requires get into some spoilers. I enjoy very emotional anime myself, whether it is sad, happy, painful, or exciting.
Overall:
I highly recommend watching this, it is really good.
The anime itself was great",9

                SAO is one of the best animes I've seen in a long time. From episode 1 I was addicted to its amazing characters and animation, with the story and interactions improving my opinion after every episode.
Despite what others may think, I don't think anyone should miss out on watching SAO. The show has a diverse variety of genres and plots that build up to an amazing climax and 2nd arc. 
And its animation is amazing. If an anime could be framed and hung in a museum, then this would definitely be the Mona Lisa :P
People's opinions have been polarized so decide for yourself if you
                  like it or not. That's the only way you'll know if you're missing out on something truly amazing or truly trashy. :)",10

                Ah, Sword Art -- I finally finished the legendary anime series that is acclaimed by so many.
And it turned out that this so loved anime is actually kind of terrible; I'm not going to lie -- it may have a lot to do with me going into it with all the great comments my friends gave it and everyone suggesting it, my expectations were too high.
Basically the only relevant characters on the cover picture are Kirito, Egil, Klein, and Asuna. Those other girls? yeah they're all in like 1 episode each really and that's it. 
What bugged me is I went in with the thought
                  that it was just a cool game they've gotta get out of -- wow that's a cool story BUT THEY PUT A FRICKIN HAREM IN IT -- WHY??
It just baffled me -- the lack of equality between genders in the show -- like Asuna appears to be really strong and independent but Kirito ends up fighting all kinda of battles for her like she's some kind of prize meant to be won which annoyed the hell out of me -- if you're going to be an independent female then BE AN INDEPENDENT FEMALE.
The whole second arc is shit. They totally went off subject and I only finished it for the sake of finishing it. It switches goals from trying to get out of SAO to a lame goal of trying to save Asuna from a different game and so many unnecessary characters come into play.
I'm sorry, I can't take 16 year old love seriously. I guess I can understand wanting to save your friend and shit but he went over the top and they acted like their love was the end all love, like no you've still got so much time to discover yourself
My advice is to watch it since it is so central to the anime community BUT go in with low expectations and don't take it seriously at all -- take it with a grain of salt. That's what you get when you come out of watching something deep and meaningful like Evangelion and go into something like SAO with absolutely nothing underneath it.",4
"
                Sword Art Online, Ill be strait forward, it is a really good show and i will tell you why in a little bit. SAO well deserves its high score in the top list. The plot is very unique and is extremely well made. Whats more is all the art, sound, characters, and everything else is just perfect and suits the show perfectly.
Story---
Very unique and to top it off it is executed perfectly. For example, In the first episode it talks about him a little and then he starts to play the game...(and to top that off the art is so amazingly vivid and it really
                  makes it much more enjoyable)
The story is very unique in the sense that there are virtual reality games and that one of them when you start you cannot leave. Also the organization of what goes where is really well done.
              Only complaint is that they could have made this last longer considering the idea or the plot has a lot to offer.
Art---
As i said before the art is incredible. It is vivid and filled with colors with many little details shown. The kind of art that is shown in this is the kind where the characters are more cute and less realistic looking. For example, they don't look like the main characters in Baccano(if that's what you like).
Characters---
Hmm...
In SAO, ill be strait forward and say that there is not much of a variety of the kind of characters. It is more or less of the same personality for most characters, BUT don't get me wrong. Just because there isn't much of a variety in characters doesn't mean they aren't good. It is still very enjoyable(though that all comes down to what you like in anime for the characters to be, so basically it's all opinion :P).
Overall,
Sword Art Online is very enjoyable and every episode leaves me with new found questions, answers, and always leaves me wanting more.",10
"
                So i just saw sword art online and I was quite disappointed. Now I know the world of MMORPG in anime isn't exactly original (look at.hack franchise/Accel world) but this show looked OK with a decent first 2 episodes and I thought I was in for a not amazing but entertaining show but what happened? well lets find out
Plot: This is the hardest to talk about without getting spoilery which I dont really in this review. Lets just say the story is a big meander, it hooks you in with the first 2 episodes but then has infamous time jumps that dont make sense. Like
                  at the episode 2 Kirito says hes going solo but at the start of episode 3 hes just joined a guild and is LEVEL 40 WHAAAATTT??? where did this come from. Writers help? This kinda kills the pacing pretty badly.
The show kills any chance of plot development to make way for harem which sucks. The romance is very forced and very poorly written. They go fishing near the end cos why the fuck not we've got the community tied up in a knot and have a creepy relationship as a mother father daughter unit and then all of a sudden some guy says lets just skip to the end, they fight and thats it over. Really? Well SAO was disappointing but not horrendous. (""uh sir its not over theres still 11 more episodes). OH GOD NO!
Then the fucking alfheim arc and my god its BAD its in my top 5 worst things ive ever seen in my life. Everything bad about it has been said and I agree with it all and I despise it too. 
Characters: By far the biggest flaw. Kirito, our main hero, lacks any kind of development, even the deaths of people hes close to he forgets until its convenient (see episode 14) and he is the same person from episode 1 till the credits roll at episode 25. You would think this traumatic experience of being in that game for 2 years would affect him but no because hes fucking Kirito. 
Asuna is neglected completely and goes from quite a cool character to boring tsundere and damsel in distress for the entire second half of the god awful alfheim arc. 
Loli girl is boring, her actual trope is the tentacle scene from episode 4 and its unbearable. Lisbeth is boring and wasteful. The villains make no sense. ""Yes I created this game where people die because I forget"" COME ON why dont you tell us writers; and the 2nd villain is about as intimidating as a 35 yr old fairy (which is exactly what he is). Leafa and her human self 'ahem' are boring and just there for fanservice.
Art: SAO is surprisingly beautiful too look at with my favourite being in episode 7 with a stunning landscape but is quickly ruined by bad dialogue and stupid writing. I like Asunas costume design. The boss fights are nice too look at but are boring because Kirito is so overpowered any chance of feeling any tension is killed off immediately.
Sound: the soundtrack is not amazing with the only stand out track being the first opening, Crossing Field,  which got me excited for the show and then it actually started (ugh). Its replaced by a crappy 2nd opening however. Quite depressing. Thank you creators of SAO.
Enjoyment: Although it seems like i despise this show (well the 2nd half in particular) the aincrad arc I kept watching as I just wanted to see them get to floor 100 and see what happens but that second arc is unforgivable and even avid SAO fans I talk to admit that its a terrible arc.
Overall: Sword art online is overhyped. To say this is the best anime of 2012 is quite depressing as Psycho-pass came out the same year. The aincrad arc is heavily flawed and boring. The fairy dance arc is an atrocity and should not be viewed by anything on the planet. Music and animation are good.
Now depsite this I give it only a 3/10 (which is still very bad) because even though its not a very good show it at least gave some people a segway into the anime genre and that can only be a good thing, right? I would have preferred something else like Death Note but oh well. I would only watch SAO just to get in on a discussion or something and share your opinion and just to see what you think. But if you are an avid fan of anime I would avoid SAO.",3

                *Insert general this is my first review*
Aaaah, SAO. How many people who have just gotten into anime love you, and oh how many people who are not stupid hate you. In the review below, I warn you, I am going to completely dis this anime, and make you not want to watch it.
Story : 4/10
The idea was really nice! Gamers being stuck in a Gaming/Anime world did inspire some other works like No Game No Life or Log Horizion (though obviously both of them did it better). I was excited for this (imagine this review being written back when the anime was still coming out),
                  I thought it is going to be one of the best things I have ever watched. Boy was I wrong!
*WARNING SPOILERS*
First three episodes were, well, decent I need to say. It had this dramatic feeling to it, good character development, the dramatic drop in episode 3. The anime made you attached to a character that you have seen only like 14 minutes ago. Then the downfall began, it slowly started changing genres, morphing into something between like romance and action, losing the dramatic genre, which is fine, it was still good, just not as perfect. The final fight was not that bad and the ending also.
 But then, the story writers probably started doing some drugs and ruined everything. The 2nd part suddenly started like : ""Oh hi everybody, here's the villain, well he is evil and stuff, raaah, be scared"" and ""Oh hi again, so umm, his sister loves him, heads up to all the siscon :D"". The 2nd part of season 1 just suddenly presented a villain, with no backstory what so ever, his only reason is that he loves Asuna and wants to marry her, and his  sister suddenly, for no reason what so ever now loves him. So hurraah! More fan service! It might seem like that would be just fine, but the way it is presented.. It's the same feeling as being thrown a fish at you and being said ""clean it"".
Art : 8/10
Let's take a break from the rant, the art is actually really good. It sorta looks similar to Fate/Zero. The characters are well designed and the art style is enjoyable.
Sound : 7/10
This mark would be probably higher if all the dubs WERE NOT TERRIBLE. The japanese voice acting is good however, which is, well, expected. The opening is also good, not the best, but good.
Characters : 3/10
Oh god, don't get me started. As I said before, up until episode 3, everything was good. Then there were just cliches, after cliches, so on and so on, just worse and worse each time. 
Probably one of the best presented characters is Kirito, since he is the MC after all. Asuna is just a bland girl with no character design, confusing dere type and no backstory. To be honest, Lis would probably even be a more interesting love interest than Asuna. Then the rest of characters.. well, you have your ""noob"" type of guy, just there for the charisma, no backstory again.  SPOILER [Then there is this bossy guy, (quite literally actually), he does have a backstory, but no reason for it.] There is also Yui. There was a build up with her, but no, she turned out to be as bland as everybody else, maybe generating a bit of feelings in some people. And that is it! 6 or 7 characters who you actually remember who are all bland, have no backstory and no character development (apart from well, Kirito).
Enjoyment : 3/10
I did enjoy a lot the first few episodes and the manga, which if I am not wrong came out after the anime. But I just cringed at the rest. Such as this useless romantic arc that came out of no where. so that's my mark, 3, for the 3 good episodes.
Overall : 3/10
There is no reason for you, person who reads this review, to be watching SAO. There is no way that you will enjoy if you have somewhat a bit of knowledge in anime/manga. If you decide to watch it, it will just make you cringe in it's awfulness. 
For all those who like this anime out there, I do respect opinions, but you should really reconsider.",3
"
                Minor spoilers in case you are one of the few who haven't seen this
Despite a quality soundtrack and impressive visuals, Sword Art Online's sloppy writing, inconsistent story, and bland characters make this much talked about series average at best. 
          Story (3/10): The premise of being stuck in a game is nothing new at all and has been done before (ex: Hack series). But I'll admit, SAO does a fairly decent job on addressing how a society would work in virtual reality as well as some psychological issues players could face in a world where if
                  you die in a game you die in real life. Gaming terms are used which is a nice touch and doesn't get in the way for new viewers as well. The show starts off rather decently with a great feel of the world and a decent exposition on how the game works as well as the main conflict. 
But all that engagement slowly dies down starting with the third episode where the show begins to take an episodic approach. This is where the show loses its momentum. Characters from the first two episodes are forgotten and only return for plot convenience. Basically it can be summed as Kirito (our supposedly socially awkward protaganist) picking up a random girl, showing off his overpowered stats, and saving the day. There's not much too it, the characters introduced are quickly forgotten and time skips make these filler episodes more infuriating and confusing. Overall, it comes across as pointless and even boring at times. The writing is also rather weak with quotes so cheesy it hits you in the spleen (ex: Two characters are skydiving and one of them blurts out ""I think I'm falling in love with you!""). 
After about five episodes of filler, the show finally bounces back to the main plot, but is distracted by a forced romance plot. The show tries to establish Kirito and Asuna as a couple in three episodes but it comes of as rushed, devoid of chemistry, and typical tsundere stuff. After all that, there's only two episodes that bother to focus on the main plot. The plot twist towards the end is clever although its ruined by a lack of any justification. Kirito's overpowered persona is increased to insane heights where the only explanation is the power of love, ugh. 
The second arc is where the show really falls apart. If the ""stuck in a game"" idea isn't original enough, how about a ""save the princess"" type of plot. All the tension from the Aincrad arc is gone and we are left with an extraneous plot and another messy love triangle, this time with incest. Other than the over-exaggerated villain, the story is forgettable and the game world doesn't feel as original or exciting as Aincrad. There are moments where the series takes itself way too seriously too the point its almost laughable. Its attempts at being edgy are countered by the silly saturday morning cartoon type villain. Deus ex machina is present at its worst and drags and already struggling series even farther in the abyss. 
          Characters (2/10): Kirito is a boring protaganist. His development is minimal and some of his actions don't match up with his supposed socially awkward personality (He seems to attract more girls than actual friends). There are also times where he is just unlikable out of nowhere (Tests a blacksmith's most prized sword by breaking it). His status as an overpowered lone wolf leaves no room for improvement with plot armor so high that any tension in fights is significantly decreased. Asuna is worse however. To be fair, she starts off interesting as a mysterious, yet powerful player who still has a lot to learn about the virtual world. This later turns out not to be the case as she's then established as a generic tsundere. It doesn't stop there as she is useless in the second arc and serves as a damsel in distress. Its sad to see a character with potential completely ruined. I can't say too much about Suguha as her only purpose is to be tortured by a doomed love triangle.
The villains are both insulting in their own way. The first villain, Kayaba, has probably the most laughable motive for trapping 10,000 people in a game (Spoilers, he forgot!). He barely shows up in the entire series and his lack of presence makes this ""honorable"" villain underwhelming. The second villain, I forget his name we'll just call him Fairy King, is a joke. The show tries to make him as crazy and disgusting as possible, but bad writing makes him unintentionally hilarious.
As for the rest of the cast, they are merely plot devices who are only there when the plot needs them and then disappear like nothing ever happened. This makes them pretty much forgettable. Sadly, I did not find any characters that stood out and the only reason this isn't a 1 is because of Sachi and her affect of Kirito. 
          Animation (6/10): The environment of Aincrad is gorgeous and filled with detail. MMO players will certainly be pleased. The fairy world is the second arc isn't as intriguing, but is nonetheless still visually impressive. The animation is mostly consistent throughout and especially shines in the fight scenes. The fight scenes are a marvel to look at. However, there are times where there looks like an awesome fight scene will erupt but is instead cut out abruptly. This acts as a major cop-out and could have served as further proof of the shows animation quality. The character designs are very appealing, and the fairy designs are quite suitable for the characters without making them look too different. I'm fine with a little fan-service as long as it doesn't get in the way, but SAO takes this way too far. The camera angles tend to angles themselves towards a female characters arse most of the time and it's very distracting and annoying. 
          Sound (7/10): OP 1 Crossing Fields is a very catchy song and the animation syncs quite well with the song. I would definitely put this OP in my top 10 though its probably because I can't get it out of my head. OP 2 Innocence is also fairly decent although it didn't catch my ear as Crossing Fields did. The endings aren't anything too special either. The soundtrack is a strong highlight for the show as each track syncs well with each scene. To be honest, its not anything to write home about, but it gets the job done. The soundtrack really shines especially in the fight scenes where the epic orchestra combined with the excellent animation makes for an incredible experience. As for Sub or Dub, either is fine. The dub isn't too bad as no one sounded too out of character, but its really nothing special. Also, the sub has its occasional unintentionally funny moments (KAYABA!).  I tend to lean towards the dub occasionally so I can focus on the scene rather than reading a bunch of text on the screen. 
          Enjoyment (6/10): The animation is pure eye candy which is complemented by a good soundtrack which was the show's biggest highlight. My favorite moments were definitely in the fight scenes. The use of building a society and the few times where the show delved into the psychology of gamers were indeed interesting. But the wonky pacing as well as time skips took away some enjoyment and may turn some people off at certain points (especially the second half). The show got boring at times especially in the filler episodes and just could not stay focused. The endless amount of potential love interests made SAO a harem unintentionally as the show was clearly trying to pair Kirito with Asuna. The mediocre writing sucked out some enjoyment for me as well as there were multiple cringe worthy moments. 
         Conclusion: I don't think this is among the worst series ever made, in fact SAO is far from that. But with such lackluster characters and story, it makes me wonder why this show is so popular. Its simple average at best. But I guess due to its popularity and devisive nature, SAO is worth a watch just so you can have an opinion on this ""controversial"" series. Overall, I give Sword Art Online a 5/10.",3
"
                Probably going to get down voted for this but I'll give it a shot nevertheless. For the fans of this anime, try to think a little before becoming angry and down voting me because you think this is a masterpiece.
The main problem with Sword Art Online is that it has no idea what it is trying to be, and when it does attempt to be something, it fails at it.
Sword art online begins with a few episodes displaying a wide world full of amazing lands and buildings. It displays very amusing game play mechanics in this game world that Kirito is thrown into. This is
                  quickly ruined by the developer of the game making the announcement that all players currently logged in are locked inside the game and that death in the game means death in real life. The anime builds a great amount of emphasis on this in the next few episodes, stressing the need for the players to work together to overcome the challenges, and showing just how difficult having someone die can be. It makes you excited for the next episodes to come. You start to wonder what's going to happen next?, will everyone die?, Will Kirito be able to get to the 100th level? How hard will it be?
You start the next episode and a little girl and a bitch are fighting over who gets some shitty item drop and the little girl ends up leaving their party in anger and goes out alone into a party dungeon area. She then encounters a few monsters who kill her pet and are about to move on to kill her when our stupidly strong solo player chick magnet badass comes along and kills the apes like the fucking alpha that he is. The little girl and Kirito proceed to go on a treasure hunt to find a flower that will revive her little lizard.
How do I feel about this? Pretty disappointed. I wanted to see how a population of gamers facing a tragedy work together and win the game or break down and die off. I instead get a filler episode that consists of our hero saving a little girl damsel in distress, and proceed to help the little girl revive her pet.
Filler in a 25 episode anime? I thought maybe that was the only part but I was sadly mistaken. Move forward a few episode and the alpha and his new girlfriend are fighting about how much of a rare meat they get to eat. Move on another episode and our SOLO player single handedly kills an OP as shit boss.
11th episode now, ELEVEN, Asuna and Kirito have had a few fights with bosses together and have hung out/eaten food once or twice and HOLY SHIT THEIR GETTING MARRIED.
*Claps*
As I said before, this anime has no idea what it wants to be and fails horribly at any attempts it gives to try and be something.
Nevertheless, art was spectacular and music was good. It had many fight scenes that looked pretty epic, usually consisting of the solo player completely obliterating the enemy with no help what so ever, but they were entertaining to watch nevertheless.
I give this a 7/10, it's fun to watch but shouldn't think too hard while watching this.",7
"
                Sword Art Online is a fast paced adaption of an author's debut novel, which does some things really great, and others not so well.
Lets start out with saying that I have read the light novels. The anime is nearly a pure adaptation of the novels, although it keeps everything chronological and brings the many side arcs and stories in line to make it more cohesive. Usually I'm a huge fan of keeping strictly to the source material. Not so much here.
The author had a major chance to expand and redevelop his debut novel into a solid anime, but instead he let them copy it directly,
                  with its many many problems with the amount of content between the floors.
Story (7) Lets face it, I went into this series expecting Aincrad's floors to be cleared one by one, drawing things out wherever possible. I was pleasantly surprised to see the first boss cleared by the second episode, and it just went as fast as it could past that. Not really predictable, but my biggest complaint is the disconnect between the side story(Second Light Novel), and the main arc. Asuna was a great character until the end of the side stories and lost her charm, becoming Kirito's foil.
Art (9) abec's visualization of the characters is what makes the the characters work for a lot of people. All of the characters stand out and are really quite well designed. The art and animation is beautiful.
Sound (10) A perfect 10. Lets face it, if not for the music, I probably would never have gotten as absorbed in this series as I have. The main theme, ""Swordland"" is inspiring and just makes the battle scenes that much more intense. The rolling drums fit the theme, and remind me of Chrono Cross' world map music.
Characters (6) The characters are improperly dealt with and don't capture a lot of what was going through the minds of the characters in the Light Novels. You get a glimpse of Kirito as a solo player that regrets being selfish and not playing and helping others, but you never get into his mind, except a few times, such as when he vilifies himself to draw ""aggro"" away from the other beta testers in the second episode. Lets break it down further.
Kirito - The main character of the series. An alleged Gary Stu of the first class. However, he's likable. It's not a harem anime, technically. Sometimes we're not so sure...
Asuna - An amazing rapier user that fights alongside Kirito. As mentioned, she starts off the series as a really awesome character, and lost most of my respect at the 9th episode. A good character, just a too generic.
Liz - Perceptive, smart, and a good friend of Asuna's. Doesn't show up much, but good none the less.
Lyfa - Lets say she has some problems. Remember that harem thing I mentioned earlier? Yeah... Otherwise she's pretty cool.
Klein - The closest thing Kirito has to a friend as a solo player. Maybe the best guy character in the show, too bad we didn't see him too much.
Enjoyment (9) I enjoyed it until the main arc started and Asuna lost a lot of my respect. The combat scenes are great and the world is richly imagined.
The per-episode flow typically keeps to a well established formula, with action and a lower key character development section included in each episode.
Overall (8) It's not the most amazing anime of all time, but it does a lot of things right in the development department. This is one of the times where I would have liked to see the author really work over his material before putting it in the format he did. Things are missing, and it's oddly paced. Plus the ALO arc is tacked on for the second half of the season.
Verdict:
Watch the first 14 episodes. The rest is fanservice and doesn't live up to the spirit of Aincrad.",8

                It's SAO nice that this 25 episode anime has ended, as I check every review made on this anime I've notice that a lot have given it an overall rating of 5 and below and only a few gave it a 6 and above. I guess I can't argue with such rating, since this anime is one part disappointing and one part satisfactory. ""SAO"" how do I rate this anime? For the story, I'm giving it a ""Very Good"" 8, since combining the fantasy, action, sci-fi, cyber punk and romance genre in the form of  "" Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG)""
                  is really quite interesting. Another thing about this anime is that even-though it was titled ""Sword Art On-line"" it was actually 2 sequels in one, so technically speaking ""SAO"" has ended in episode 14, episode 15 to 25 is Alfheim Online or ALO. However, the problem with studio A-1 Pictures, is that has put more emphasis on the quantity of the episodes so much so that some of episodes are useless fillers and sways us audience away from the anime, there are other review which states that the said anime should have just focus on the   Aincrad setting of ""SAO"" that take a huge U-turn to another sequel setting in   Yggdrasil part of "" ALO."" I guess that was the primary reason why a lot of reviews gave it a low overall rating.
Art: Mediocre 5.
I don't have much to say about the art, since I'm not an art critic anyway and besides Asuna's statutory rape scene by her lunatic husband supposed to be,  Nobuyuki Sugō was censored anyway and it's pretty obvious that he didn't get to pump her.
Sound: Fair 6.
Basically I like the opening theme of ""SAO,"" but not ""ALO's"" opening theme, I also like that  Asuna's VA was done by Haruka Tomatsu.
Characters: Decent 4.
Well, I don't how to put my finger in this anime's category, all I can say is that I like the way that Kirito is portray as this bull headed lone wolf, in which his character is way too predictable, Asuna is basically you typical fighting vixen who becomes Kirito's on-line wife....in ""SAO"" that is, but I really hate that from a fighting vixen she was transformed as a helpless damsel in distress in 'ALO."" When Lyfa came into the picture in ""ALO"" suddenly I felt that Kirito should have forgotten Asuna and be with Lyfa . If there is any charcter that gives me the most impact it is Oberon the Fairy King or  Nobuyuki Sugō, ok so he's the 2nd main baddie who appeared in ""ALO"" but he's one baddie where I would like have his head chopped off , so the rating for this category is for him.
Enjoyment and overall: Fair 6.
TBH, there are episode that were enjoyable and there are episodes that are not, the thing her is that the plot of the anime thought it is very good, has been stretch thinly to fill the 25 episode slot. Frankly this anime should have just been limited to just 20 episode and instead of shifting from one setting to another studio A-1 Pictures should have just finish the Aincrad   setting and allocated ""ALO"" as a sequel to be aired on another season. So far the enjoyment is mainly on the action genre of this anime than anything else, in fact the rest of the genre don't played out well, so therefore both the enjoyment and the overall of this anime only deserves a 6.  
HAPPY HOLIDAYS",6

                Let's be honest; SAO is terribly bad . To start off , I was extremely excited to watch the series because of all of the hype and recognition it got. And I admit after reading the storyline, I myself was also hoping for an enjoyable new series to watch . Sadly, SAO turned out to be intensely mediocore and overhyped . Honestly I can't see why most people call it such a spectacular show . To back up my opinion here are a few of my reasons . 
1. Character's Individuality/Personality : Kirito is about the most plain protagonist I have EVER seen . He's
                  your typical nice guy that's strong for almost no reason . He has absolutely no spice, nothing that really makes you like him . What's worse is that the author made him very popular among the female characters ; they all fall in love with him although nothing sets him apart from your average teenage male . 
2. Storyline/Plot : The storyline itself is actually really fascinating ; how it was played out was what made it so bad . Like come on, getting trapped inside an MMORPG game , how can you even make it bad ? Impossible , yet the author managed to do so . For one , there was never an explanation on WHY the creator of the game confined them in that death game , which really bugged me for a while . In addition , SAO's fairy arc was terrible . I didn't see anything special about it worth mentioning and it practically went farther downhill towards there .
3. Romance : The romance factor of the show was also something that really killed it for me . I felt that instead of focusing on Kirito's and Asuna's relationship so much , the author should have focused more on the action and  main problem of the game . Furthermore not only was the romance unnecessary , it wasn't well developed . As plain as Kirito's character was , the plainer the love was . I felt no connection , no chemistry between the two partners . It was more forced than Miley's twerking . They literally were friends one minute ,then became husband/wife, and had sex the next fucking episode . Now I'm not a shoujo expert or anything , but I'm pretty sure that's not how fast relationships should develope .
By now you should understand why SAO is NOT satisfactory. Watch it if you wish , but it's not something that should be so highly spoken of .",3

                For some reason, Sword Art Online attracts a lot of haters, oops, I mean, polarized opinions - we don't want to hurt the sensibility of wannabe Oscar critics too much here now, they are really soft and tender inside despite their haughty exteriors.
You probably have heard it all, Kirito is a Gary Stu, he's a generic shounen fantasy insert, SAO is a fan-fiction (apparently people don't understand the meaning of fanfic), SAO is a harem-in-disguise, the main female character is just a pumpkin, SAO is sexist... yeah, sure, if any of the above is really your criteria for a show, you probably will find SAO
                  to be terrible, so let me save you the time here, don't watch it. You will thank me for saving you the trouble. Heck, feel free to read all the 1-3 point reviews that haters, I mean Roger Eberts, decide that they ""have to voice"" to make sure people can get balanced views about what SAO really is - a shitty piece of anime that should have never been made, or written in the first place. To their minds, the author and the anime studio should light fires and burn themselves to death for the disservice that they did to the humanity.
Want to hear the other side of the story? Want to hear why the critics might not necessarily be right in their mind? I mean, who are they to tell you what you might or might not enjoy anyway? Do they really know your taste?
What is the goal of anime? Is it to be analyzed to death on seeing what and where the story is screwed up so haters can feel like they are really enlightening us retards who don't know any better about what a good anime is? Or is it something that's meant to serve as an entertainment? 
Do you want to be entertained? Are you willing to give something a chance so you can be entertained?
If you want to be entertained and willing to give something a chance, then let me tell you, there is a lot that SAO can offer you. It has a great story, great visual, great music, and great voice acting. You will find the animation to be top-notch, the OST stellar, the actions engaging, and the story moving. 
Actions? Check. Fantasies? Check. Premise? Check. Romance? Check. Strong protagonists? Check. Great heroines? Check. Tough villains? Check. SAO has just about everything you can ask for in a story.
Is it perfect? No. Are there plot holes? Yes. SAO honestly should have been told over two seasons (4 cours). There are a lot that are better treated in the source material than in the anime. It's done in a structure that can be confusing to people unfamiliar with the source material. It wastes quite a bit of its potential (even in the source material). 
But you see, all that does is that it didn't live up to the expectations that people can have on it. What it means is that it's not as good as one hope it would be. 
Somehow that makes people ""hate"" it. Yeah, people ""hate"" an anime that's not the best thing ever. 
If humans can only be loved when they are only the best, that's a pretty sad way to live, isn't it? 
Anyway. Nobody can tell you whether you will like a show - that is up to you to decide. And it's up to you to decide with your heart. After all, like is a feeling, not a score to be analyzed. I am writing this review to simply balance against the haters. Don't let the wannabe critics sway your opinions of what you should or should not like. Watch it yourself. You might not like it, but you wouldn't know until you try.",8

                Weirdly enough, Sword Art Online racked up popularity (from people who hadn't read the light novels)  before it even started. I don't know what the deal is with that. Maybe because gamers can relate to the story, or because this anime doesn't necessarily have a bad start. Maybe it has a certain Naruto-esque charm to it for newcomers in anime. Maybe it's the art. Maybe it's because, despite all the glittery-eyed fangirls and fanboys that get hyper about Sword Art Online, there are a few enjoyable qualities to this anime. Or maybe it's just because people have their own opinions and will always have
                  their own reasons for relating to something.
During the first of the two arcs, the Aincrad Arc, a world with some beautiful moments is created. I can't deny that SAO has a good premise. Aincrad is dark, yet beautiful, and doesn't have a bad feel. That being said, things aren't flawless. 
Aincrad's monsters are anticlimactic, invoking little fear and bringing nothing ""gasp-worthy"" to the table. The world is also not as good as some great MMORPGs out there, but that's to be expected.
The second arc - the Alfheim Arc - has its fair share of flaws. The already faulty seriousness of the story plummets. Some very likable things change, and the main source of tension is taken away. Aincrad was truly over too quickly. If it had been longer, many things such as pacing and character development problems, could have been smoothed out. Ultimately, I feel that the anime was hurt.
SAO does, however, excel animation and art-wise. The style, itself, is fairly basic, but does manage to stray from the norm a bit. The animation is nearly flawless. I like the choice of colors for each of the worlds, and how epic the battle sequences appear. Some flaws, however, include the monsters, which have little detail to them, the fairly plain character design (just not enough detail for someone who plays MMORPGs), and the crazy ""insane faces"" that seem to look a bit wrong to me most of the time.
Out of everything, my favorite aspect of SAO is its music. The music in SAO is very well done. I'm fond of the openings and endings, as well as the OSTs, which come in at just the right time without being overwhelming. I even looked the soundtrack up on Youtube to listen to in my free time. The voice acting in both the dub and the sub are well done.
The characters get the lowest rating for a reason. The characters in SAO often come across, and sometimes just fall, flat. Our main character, Kirito, has serious personality and development issues. He is overpowered, that's a fact, and he's also loved almost unconditionally by most that he meets.
I can tell that the anime aimed to make Kirito a very likable character. But they missed the point. Making a character likable doesn't mean that they have to be flawless. Despite this, they attempted to give him better character development. We can see hints of what they try to do, but it often falls short. In the end, he becomes inconsistent, and at times changes drastically - but we don't see the development that leads up to this, making his character a sluggish and poorly done one.
The main girl in this anime, Asuna, doesn't fare much better. Again, we can see where they wanted to go, but it didn't get there. She started off as a pretty good heroine - strong-willed and feisty, though underdeveloped and flawless. By the second arc, she purely became a damsel in distress, and again, her character changed. All of the character development that could have happened just didn't.
Another problem is the fact that all of the girls have an infatuation with Kirito. They have all seem to have unconditional crushes on him, leaving us with one question - ""Why?""
The characters in SAO are promising. But they aren't handled well. There are some intriguing characters here, and yet, most of them are pushed out of the way before they can even get good. The ones that aren't have pretty good moments, but not enough screen-time or importance is put on them, so they ultimately disappoint.
The romance in this anime is just as undeveloped. We don't see much of that beloved ""buildup"" in it - their relationship is just there. While there are some (sickeningly) sweet moments, the romance is overwhelmingly superficial at times. But I guess that's how all teenage love is.
Despite not being a technically great anime, Sword Art Online has its times of enjoyment for me. The battles, good music, half-hearted suspense, and sometimes sheer ridiculousness of everything made Sword Art Online enjoyable, once I realized that I shouldn't expect too much. If you watch Sword Art Online, I hope that you go into it lightheartedly, because you might just enjoy this anime for what it is - or what you, personally, think it is.",6
"
                This is my second review in MAL.
I write all my thoughts and onion about this anime, there is could be some people who do not agree with me or even find it a bit offensive, but well here we go.
With out doubt SAO is one of the most popular anime in the recent years, I have been heard a lot of it and for some time ago I was looking forward to watch it, people told be that this anime is really good but I just didn't bought that at all.
After a I watched this anime I could say this anime is WAY overrated, average
                  or even bad could be scores for this anime but I'm not going to say any of those because this anime was actually enjoyable, but well here we go!.
Story: the main plot of this series take place in a MMORPG cyber world were all the players were forced to play and complete the game in order to save their life, a really young and lonely hero is our main protagonist who will go forward to complete the game, in that process he will meet a lot of people and also his true love and also will learn a lot of things and secrets, I think this concept it's really good, I 
normally don't find anime with this concept of a MMORPG cyber world, however I think it just was that because after that they did´t develop a truly interested plot, I think everything was normal and very lineal, also we find a lot of filler considering that this anime only have 25 episodes, I said the concept was really predictable, the hero arrive, meet a bunch of friends and people, learn some thing 
and then save the day with her girlfriend, but everything was not bad at all, something that I really  enjoyed was the relationship of Asuna and Kirito, because was very mature considering their age, we 
normally don't see this type of relationships in anime, they were clear about their feelings and after what happened they moved forward in their relationship
7/10
Art: Personally I didn't liked the art at all, was not bad but comparing it with other series of 2011 and today I think was not good and also I can't believe that a so popular anime like this it actually have this art, I'm talking about the design of the characters, however I must says that the clothes, robes and armors were really good and more in the scenario that the game took place, also I really enjoyed the maps and the environment because it's really looked like a big map/stage of a MMORPG, but with that I think that the most important thing is the design of the character because the anime turns around them
7/10
Sound: I must says that the song was the better developed part for the anime however and ironically was the most meaningless, yes they had the correct soundtrack for every stage, but it didn't help the anime at all, I should say that the OP/ED I really enjoyed specially the second opening Characters: For me this was the main issue with the anime, the characters were so poorly development, aside the protagonist/antagonist the other characters only were used as filler they didn't took any important part in the story, I think the most important they do was taught a lesson to Kirito that he only mentioned once and it became meaningless, well were are going to review the main characters
Krito: Personally I dislike him a lot, I don't remember the last time I saw a character that was so overprotected in an anime, I mean, since the beginning he had advantage because he was a beta tester 
so he didn't have any issue beaten anyone, not only that his attitude was the same as a douche, not only was arrogant but cocky as well, also every time he faced an opponent he always looked so strong and good and defeated them easily not only that, the majority of their opponents were a bunch of cans so he never met a really threat, the only time he faced a true threat was in the ending of the first part when he faced the creator of SAO Heathcliff, this guy actually looked serious, in his fight against Kirito for have admin rights obviously he had all the tool to win and so was... until for some strange reason miracle when the HP of kirito arrive to zero he for some reason took strength and guess what? heat beat Headcliff and as well saved the day, his role in the second part then was exactly the same as the first one so I can say anything new here, one of the few difference is that boss, the man that was suppose to be the main boss, was actually a coward/pedophile who controlled the new game and this time Kirito embarrass him even worse than the others characters and not only in the game but in the real world as well, in the end Kirito never met a true threat not even a rival, we never saw any interesting fact about him, the only thing I must say that I really like it about him was her maturity in his relationship with Asuna, but after that I really disliked this character, not only for his attitude, he didn't bring nothing interesting to care about him and was so verrated/overprotected
Asuna: the main female girl in the history, I liked her a bit more than Kirito, but I must say that her design was so good, I think she is the only reason that this anime could be so over and popular, but well, we are going to talk about her attitude, to be honest I can say much about her, like the pretty girl in the history the majority of men fall in lover with her or at least they like her, she was kinda cute and nice but when she gets mad she is really mean, but well, some of the good thing that I like  
her was her maturity as I said before to engage a true relationship with Kirito, at some point I thought 
that she was antipathetic but at the end she was one of the more enjoyable character, at least she 
cooked for Kirito and that was one of the more enjoyable parts of the relationship, in general about 
the relationship I think she an excellent women in every aspect( you're a lucky bastard to find her Kirito-kun xDD) and also the most important thing about her is the fact that she actually took an important role 
in the first part, because like Kirito she was also a warrior and a strong one and helped Kirito a lot in his journey, 
however I think that in the second part they completely destroy Asuna, and you know why? because she was 
captured and then she became the main goal that motivated Kirito to complete the game, and the anime fall in the concept that the hero should save her useless princess, Asuna lost a ton of momentum in the second part and after that she was no as tough as she was in the first part, at the end Kirito saved her and they live happily after that
Suguha: she supposedly was the sister of kirito in real life, however she was instead her cousin, she briefly appear in the first part at the begging, after that she took an important role in the second part as the helper of Kirito, for some reason I don't know why she was booked to fall in love for Kirito, not only in the real life but in the game as well, her feelings for her were so deep, I think that was so sad because not only their were familiar related but also it would be impossible to separate kirito from Asuna that would have been without doubt the biggest mistake in the series, however it didn't happen, after all she relinquished her feelings and agree to help Kirito in her quest to save Asuna, I think she was one of the best character, she had attitude, looking, boobs and also was nicely but after the incident with Kirito she became a full drama queen, at least she helped Kirito and was also weird see her along with Asuna, at the end she was one of the few rescatable characters
5/10
Enjoyment: after all I must say that I enjoyed a bit the anime, was not great as a lot of people state but I 
really enjoyed it, for example: the relationship Kirito/Asuna, the Environment, soundtrack among others, 
if you are a gamer aside an anime fan and/or like the romance I think this anime is for you however I 
don't recommend it at all
6/10
Overall: In my opinion I can say this anime is AVERAGE not so good nor that bad, the people exaggerated a lot about the value of this anime, sure the cyber world was a good concept, but the characters and the development of the plot were bad, the only think I can see about this anime that can be marketable/mainstream it's Asuna, because even the design of the characters was not good at all and the plot was lineal and predictable, I thought after the first part the second one would be the reason of the popularity of this anime but guess what? the second part was even worst than the first one  because not only was the same thing as the first but also the real danger was gone they can go and return to both worlds when they wanted, also Asuna was captured and then Kirito carried the whole story along with Lyfa and it become so predictable, the plot of the hero saving the princess without nothing new, without Lyfa nor Asuna and with that final boss I would say that second would have been a completely joke but it didn't happened, but well after endure a douche like Kirito all the 25 episodes I can say this anime is actually enjoyable, if you want to watch an anime and past your time and also have an popular anime to talk about I think this is a good option, however I don't recommend it at all as I said before
6/10

                I always wondered to myself about the scarcity of shounen x shoujo anime, after watching this series I found out why.
Sword Art Online during it's release impressed everyone with it's original concept and plot, the hype was astounding which kind of coerced me into watching the series. The first couple of episodes proved it's hype for me, the concept was original and explored the grounds of a general shounen anime with hints of romance between the two main characters.
However, with it's grand debut comes the anticipation for the rest of the series. I was excited about it, I genuinely was because the female protagonist proved
                  to be a promising, strong and empowering character but later turned into a disposable female character yelping like a damsel in distress (main reason for the 2nd season). Along with that, the male character later turns into an angst-y, livid-fuelled character with his main motivation supposedly to beat the game but was primarily formed for his love with the female protagonist. His love later turned into stupidity (reasons including why he's in the 2nd season) and her character turns into the anime's Princess Peach.
There were some plausible parts, which I can understand the popularity it attained during it's first few episodes. Badass action, witty dialogue and a sense of belonging - especially those in the game - some themes were well executed such as humanity, power and anarchy. 
If you want a break down: Episodes 1-5 Amazing. 6-11 Tolerable. 12+ Mediocre, highly highly mediocre.
 The story itself was in-check but was ruined by these two angst fuelled, teenage love story. The fusion between romance and action can sometimes be blended nicely but in this case, seemed to only be fused for the sake of a wider audience. There were loose plot-holes and things that were never addressed (if it was addressed in the manga, please forgive me) characters with little development and some characters had potential but later cast aside. It's as if the producers put all they're effort in the first few episodes and then continue to ride off the popularity from then on thus putting little effort with the rest.
The art and sound is fair, nothing atypical about it.
Excellent plot, but definitely poorly executed. If you enjoyed this anime, you may have poor taste or just haven't watched enough good ones.",4
"
                Well hello. I'm partially bias because I read the books first and I loved them. That being said I hope this will be as objective as possible. I will give examples of the episode in particular but if some great development happens I keep quiet.(Sorry if anything is misspelled) 
Story: The introduction to the story was very well done in my opinion. After a while it started to slow down around the middle and it picked up again. The way they introduced the main plot twist was very well done in my opinion but I feel that, even though all the basis were covered by
                  the first episode, it would have been better to make a longer first episode. I believe that there is no problem with the series caching up with the books because in the books there is a time-skip. If the developers take the time to do each floor, and all the side-stories that have been made, than the series will be on at least as long as bleach.
Art: I really enjoyed the art style used because it gives a MMORPG vibe, at least to me. It also makes it very easy to make the beautiful childish world of Aincrad, the name of the virtual game world, into a scary place. I was personally scared during the system announcement but I'm pretty spokish so...
Sound: I personally don't pay much attention to the sound, unless there is an epic piece of music playing, but I felt it really helped with the mood, changing at exactly the right moment.
Characters: I really liked all of the characters. I found them likable and I could understand there dilemmas, at least the one showed at the end of the episode.  I hope that they expand on all the characters because in the books I felt that they where kind of shallow, with the exception of the 2 main characters, but that will be seen in later episodes.
Enjoyment: I was entertained the whole episode but there were some moments that I wished they would pick up the pace. That being said these were few and I am a very impatient person.
I believe this will become a great series, if they pick up the pacing it will be excellent, and I'm really looking forward to later episodes. 
Overall: 8.6 rounded up to 9.",9

                I can hardly talk about any points I had lined up without being dismissed as just another voice in a rising tide of dissent and criticism aimed at Sword Art Online. If you need some constructive take-down of this show, there's always one to be found.
Let me talk about one of the biggest flaws this anime had, and how fixing it could have salvaged this anime.
Sword Art Online, the internal world, takes itself far too seriously. With a premise built around a bunch of people trying to beat a VMMORPG, there needs to be some solid development to the story, the setting, and audience investment
                  in general for this to be overlooked.
Yes, these players can die, I know. But every time I think about it I remember 'they're playing a game'. Putting both together means the audience needs to really feel just how serious this situation is; you hardly get that. Let's list why:
1. Kirito is a walking juggernaut/panty-wetter. At one point he's outmatched at something like 7-1 by other players. he proceeds to walk straight at them as they hack and slash at him repeatedly (remember, he can die boys and girls), only for him to sput off ""I can regen faster than all of you can hurt me"". A protagonist who consistently pulls shit like this breaks any semblance of conflict or danger. Not only that, every bloody player with a vagina is trying to hump him because harem-logic. Fuck.
2. Antagonists have little to no motivation. (MILD SPOILER) When it turns out the creator of this death-trap has jack-all of a reason for setting this in motion, and the players/survivors barely give a shit about this in itself, it bothers me. A real outburst from Kirito over it would have been something at least; An ill-fated gang-up on the creator would have saved faced. Nope. There's no sense of threat from this. It's just... vapid. 
And when another antagonists actions (again, true motivation lacking) are so over-the-top it makes you want to vomit cheese, you break the sense of reality yet again.
I can't even go on. It hurts to think about it. 
What I'm pointing out is that there is no sense of 'Oh shit lives are at risk and these guys mean business and the hero is in serious danger', all the while we are expected to think otherwise when the setting is a Virtual Game.
A Game. If they played this aspect closer to the comical side of the situation, Focused on developing solid characters and really breathing life into just how real this virtual world was supposed to feel, this anime would've stood a chance.
It doesn't. It simply doesn't.
Last note: The romance between Kirito and Asuna, while it hijacks the storyline far more than it should, was the only thing that I really approved (in the first arc at least). It's not overly-complicated, it's simple, it's sweet, and given their age and circumstances, it's mature. I enjoyed it for what it was worth",4

                Let's make this quick and painless, shall we? Sword art online is an anime centered around the game, well, Sword art online. Kirito (Our main bland character) is a beta tester in the vrmmorpg (Virtual reality mmo rpg) Sao (shortened for the sake of whats left of my sanity) gets stuck with all the rest of the players in the just released live game, here's the kicker! if the helmet used to simulate the game (think of it like an Oculus Rift but as a helmet and better and with real pain) is taken off, it will fry your brain. So this makes Kitty toes
                  one of millions of hostages in this microwave death helmet prison, where you have to get to the 100th floor to get out of the game. The first 15 episodes are fine, so it makes this hard to review. The next episodes are un-bearable, /a/ and other reviewers. In short this was a decent anime with it's high points but definitely was a piece of shit after episode 15. In meow's immortal words ""I give it a solid OK, it has that bake instant taste to it, you know what I mean?"".",4
"
                Well, here's a shot at my first review:
This show seemed to have a whirlwind of either positive or negative feelings centered around it last year. I'm joining the latter. 
Story
The concept itself seemed great. Thousands of people are trapped in a virtual MMO by a lunatic game creator, and their only means of escape is to surpass all the game's levels. There's even a fatal catch.
While the first few episodes held promise, it struggled and then fell flat on its face. I could rant on and on about why I didn't particularly care for it. Honestly, I wanted to watch for the gaming aspect-- which
                  is almost non-existent. Besides the bosses and enemies, the most you'll probably see is HP levels and gathering materials. 
Another massive problem **spoiler?** is the romance. I suppose this is supposed to be the show's strongest point. Their relationship should be a reason to keep on fighting to get out in this dire world. They want to save everyone and burst out of that virtual hellhole, right? No. In fact, there's about 3-4 episodes where they're just slacking around. There could be more strategising, but this obstacle just sort of shoves that out of the picture.
And here we get to the root of the problem. The pacing. The series is 25 episodes long. The first arc spans across 15 episodes, and the second across the last 10. We jump forward levels upon levels. The first part is almost completely centered around their non-progressive romance and then we have... um, the rest. I can't even stress this enough. The second part is downright meaningless and disturbing at most points. I'm not entirely sure if it's based directly off the manga, but perhaps it would've been better to trash the second arc and just expand the first.
Art
It did have some colorful and amazing art. Whenever they stumbled into a fighting scene, it ran so smoothly it really blew me away. The hair movement, the weapon clashing... Agh, it just blew me away.
Character
Kirito is probably the strangest character I've ever seen-- not appearance-wise. At first he was a loner, and he several girls falling around him. That all changes, sort of? I felt as if I really couldn't get a read on him. He was just kind of there main character and had some likeabe moments. Then we have Asuna. Everybody knows and loves her in that world. She comes off as tough at first and then dwindles down a bit.
The supporting/side characters are literally just supporting characters (they appear during random battles and whatnot). And some are seen maybe twice and then never again.
In conclusion...
My advice would be to not go diving into this series expecting too much. You might be disappointed.",4
"
                Sword Art Online focus between game and reality. 
The things that we are playing RPG, MMRPG, Strategic games and etc. What if the main characters of that game is us. 
SAO has a good main story that enable us to interact of the game world is the same as the reality world, that you can only live 1 life if you die there will be no second chance of life to return back to the world where you live in. 
The story makes you feel exciting and more enjoyable, and think that you are living in this world to survive and to live long, like
                  in the game you need to survive and to level up high by making your equipment more durable and strong enough to fight foes.",10
"
                I am pretty sure this is one of those animes where you either love it, or hate it with a burning passion. I may be however, one of the few who are in the middle. Don't get me wrong, the show was absolute crap at some points, but at rare times it was a decent show. 
Story: 8/10 
The story itself is decent, being trapped in a video game isn't exactly a common story plot and in fact before I even watched it I was pretty excited. In the beginning things seemed to be moving nicely, but the further the anime progressed the more plot
                  holes emerged. It was moving very fast and there were more than a few questions unanswered. 
Art: 9/10
This is the highest this show will get sadly. The animation in this show has a lot of stunning qualities, and it is easy to get distracted by the amount of detail that goes into the virtual world. 
I rather enjoyed the differences in each characters appearance, the item designs and character clothing was also very awesome. 
Sound: 6/10
The music did well with making you feel like a video game, when the standard in town music played I felt like I was actually there. But it felt like they used the same music tracks over and over again, I felt like it lost its meaning to the different scenes that specific track was being played in. The 'sad' moments especially,  you'll see what I mean if you watch it. 
Character: 5/10 
At first, the characters seemed alright. We've got basic badass protag Kirito who enjoys going solo and refuses to join parties or guilds. I don't mind his chill attitude per say, but what DOES annoy me is that almost every single girl he comes in contact with gains some sort of romantic feelings for him. It's kinda frustrating to see someone fall in love with another while just getting ore for a sword >.>
 Then there's Asuna, I liked her in the beginning, her sharp tongued and strong willed attitude was great. But what some people would call ""Character Development"" I would call ""Character Butcherment"" (Yes I made that word up). Asuna goes from this talented badass swordswomen to a helpless girl who cries, a lot. It was kinda sad to see a potentially awesome character go to waste. 
There's also the fact of unnecessary fanservice towards a younger female character who seemed like young child, she just wanted her pet back. It was pretty ridiculous. 
Enjoyment: 7/10
I enjoyed the series to an extent if I ignore most of it's flaws, the plot was interesting to me and I really did enjoy all the action. 
Overall: 7/10 
Would I recommend this anime to lots of people? No. Would I recommend it at all? Yes. I'd like to think it's one of those animes you can use as a test to see if you are past that whole ""ALL ANIME IS PERFECT"" phase which pretty much everyone goes through. The story and characters aren't the best, but at least it looks pretty. 
About the dub, I've seen a lot of crappy dubs, this was wasn't TOO bad. If you are only into sub, just stick with the subbed. All in all, give it a try, just don't expect many people to take your side if you think it's a fantastic anime.",7
"
                Warning: The review contains spoilers
Let's start with the plot: the anime takes place in 2022, when humanity has invented a machine, the Nervegear, which gives the possibility of entering into a completely virtual reality, and it is in this virtual reality that will take place the adventures of our characters.
""Sword Art Online"" is an anime that has a plot already fantastic. The anime is the perfectly and adds elements that reinforce even more what is the anime itself and the plot accordingly.
Little analysis of the characters
- Kirito: the protagonist, needless to say it is the best character I've ever found in an anime. Hit me
                  right away and I am sure I'm not the first and will not be the last either, because of its dark, strong, bold, brave; hides a fragile side that nevertheless helps to increase the strength of this character ... needless to comment on his spectacular gifts from swordsman.
- Asuna: great character, future girlfriend Kirito, has a mysterious power over him, he manages to bring out the fragile side of Kirito and keep it safe leaving the swordsman what stronger can use in battle, but its importance is not end here. In fact it is a skilled swordsman and has a strong character and determination, which then molt, but this is another side very nice of her. These two together are the nicest couple I've ever seen in an anime.
- Yui: a little girl that her daughter will be so to speak of Kirito and Asuna (so to speak because it is the product of a virtual environment and not really their daughter)
- Klein: Friend of Kirito, its function is a bit 'to shoulder moral in some cases and the bearer of humor (I have no better word to describe it at the time), much good character too. It 'a samurai, uses a katana and it is interesting as a character.
- Agil: does not appear much, but his presence, when there is, there is great ... a strong man temperamentally without disturbances and is probably what ties him to Kirito.
- Liz: girl in charge of forging weapons: forging, good character, best friend Asuna, ace in the use of poker, funny and frank; it is these two things to give her a charm all its own.
- Silica: what after all is less important, but good character, pretty and fragile ... how can you not adore it ?! A mascot.
- Sugu / Leafa: sister Kirito, reflects some parts of his character. It really is not just the sister of Kirito, because it is his cousin, and it will end up loving Kirito, but very soon clash with the presence of Asuna, who Kirito is a mainstay, and therefore will understand that he had hopes. Skilled swordsman in ALO and very interesting as a character.
Let us now consider some sull'anime: the anime has many twists and a very interesting plot, which increasingly takes the viewer as they pass the episodes, and that keeps you glued to the screen. The fights are very beautiful and make their mark; not easily forget the feelings that they leave and not even the fighting style of the characters, not to mention the ability to Kirito, that will impress more and more and that will even want to practice the art of the sword, which is not for everyone, of course.
The characters of the characters are all different and therefore everyone can find one that reflects it and identify with it; scenes ""epic"" and leave as there are for fighting the sign, just think of the episode 9 when Kirito fights with Gleam Eyes; romantic scenes hit straight to the heart and leave a sense of sweetness out of the ordinary, that sometimes even the romantic souls real can give (you have to remember that ""Sword Art Online"" romantic souls it is only in part, because it is an anime fighting, action, fantasy, adventure, and, despite being a romantic souls who puts in place a non-primary, still leaves the feelings expressed above, which is very rewarding and satisfying).
The design of the characters, the swords, the environments are well made and leave stucco, just think all'Elucidator or Dark repulsar, just think of the arena boss of seventy-fifth floor; soundtracks are magnificent and remain impressed, the opening is magnificent and the choice of the use of different background music is always well targeted, and increases even more the factor of epic battles.
The anime has two arches both really cool and you do cherish and remember, remain in the mind and not disappear, just think that I remember what happened in every single episode of ""Sword Art Online"".
Conclusion: the anime stra-is recommended for all, to see absolutely not to miss work from enormous value, not to miss work to a level rarely found both the graphics and the weft that for characters. The anime deserves a nice 10, then the final score: 10.",10
"
                The first few episodes are amazing, then it falls into a painful routine of one of the biggest wastes of amazing art and music in anime history.
Meet Dorito-kun.  A nerd-slash-MMORPG-pimp who ignores his only friend Klein because he's the kind of guy who only wants to game with one girl at a time, one who's younger and weaker than he is to impress her.  
Dorkito-kun leads on a bunch of different girls, including his sister at one point.  And even though he spends all of his time going on e-dates and romantic walks through majestically illustrated forests, he is the greatest player
                  of all time.  
Herein lies my biggest complaint about the protag - he doesn't have to spar, practice, or TRY to be the best in the world.  He just spends his time hangin' and bangin' with his hoes, spends the second half of the story trying to save his bottom bitch from being raped by a creepy elf, yet has stupid strong and  overpowered skills.  A main character needs vulnerability to make me care about what happens, otherwise the chase becomes predictable - case in point.  Granted, this is what every nerd fantasizes about, so the show probably provides adequate escapism for said target audience.
On most episodes the best part is when the intro and outro music plays. 
The whack-ass plot is wrapped in impressive, top-level production value.  The music is memorable, thematic, and adventurous.  One of the best overall scores for an anime that I've ever heard.  The scenery, settings, and character designs are awesome too.  
It just feels unfortunate when amazing artists and composers are given such mediocre, cliche stories to frame.  This time, they made a mountain out of a molehill of a plot and kept me along for the ride.  
I will probably listen to the soundtrack on YouTube for years to come and never watch the show again.

                Sword Art Online was one of the most hyped anime that came out in July, everyone was talking about it and you can basically see it anywhere, at first I ignored it and didn't bother trying it because I thought it was one of those bad overly-hyped anime but then I gave it a shot and it surprised me, it actually was a pretty good anime, but as they say ""every good thing comes to an end"" but in this case it goes way beyond the end.
-Story- The story takes place in the year 2022, the virtual reality MMO game (Sword Art Online) is released,
                  not like any other MMO this one uses a device called the Nerve Gear, it allows gamers to experience the game just as if its real life, sounds pretty neat huh? well yeah but not really...
Sword Art Online starts pretty damn good, with a crazy person (Kayaba Akihiko the creator of SAO) that traps the players in the game unable to log out and if they die there they will die in real life, that thought alone made me really excited and encouraged me to watch the anime. Now the only way to leave SAO and log out is to climb the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. And from there the anime starts moving really neatly with some powerful side stories and lovable side characters, some parts that will make you happy and excited and other that will make you cry like a baby, now everything goes well and smooth until episode 15, I don't want to spoil anything but I can say this, the world of SAO is gone and a new world/MMO called Alfheim Online (ALO)  comes along, now I myself would have been really happy with this series ending at episode 14 they could have made some changes to the end and it would have been perfect, like a sad ending or an open ending or whatever, but unfortunately the series continues from SAO to ALO and from there everything goes down the hill, too much plot holes and not enough new characters, and if there were new characters they are just plain annoying, they don't even have stories just some random side characters that appear for only 1 episode or 2, now without spoiling stuff about ALO I can just say that things don't go as smooth as in SAO.
-Art- There isn't much to say here, the art of Sword Art Online is ok, its casual not really impressive yet not bad, you can see some really nice places and visuals but not overly good, the animation is ok as well. Now the characters design is normal and not really significant, now what I am saying here is about the (SAO) world, things are kinda different in (ALO), first off the character design is really poor. I don't know if this effected anyone else but me, but  I really think that giving the characters wings and long ears ruined a big part of the anime you can't look at the characters seriously, even the main boss looks plain silly with butterfly wings you can't just look at him and take him seriously even at the most critical moments of the anime. Other than that the background and places you see in (ALO) are much less creative and appealing from the ones you have seen in the previous season.
-Sound- Sword Art Online doesn't have the best music soundtrack, but its not bad its ok for an action anime, it kind gives you the MMO/RPG vibe from it so its just good enough and kinda fits. Other than that it has good voice acting and ok sound effects.
-Characters- Like I said before the characters are normal, nothing special about them just like any other plain anime characters.
Now here is where it gets tricky. First we have the main character (Kirigaya Kazuto) or as his game name (Kirito). Now what I really didn't like about this character is that he started strong from the start, so until the end he didn't really improve, actually he didn't improve at all he was the same character from the start, I don't recall seeing him ever level up, and that also goes for the other main Character (Yuuki Asuna) they both start strong somehow we don't know what they did, if they trained, or cheated, they just BAM throw the characters at us like that, which kinda ruins the fun .. so yeah.
Now another point to say here is the major difference between the characters of (SAO) and (ALO) not just the character design and the way they look, but also their behavior and importance. Now in (SAO) you will meet a lot of side characters and weirdly enough you will fall in love with them even though they too are kind of limited, you don't see them a lot just in a couple of episodes but you can't help but like them, and those characters do have some side stories and importance to the main character Kirito. Other than that they look alright, not annoying, and quiet enjoyable. And after (SAO) you will not see those characters again maybe for a minute in episode 25 but that's it, which is really sad because these character were actually good. As for the characters of (ALO) ... Well you don't really see much of them. You have (Kirigaya Suguha) also known as (Lyfa) she is his sister/cousin/doctor.../daughter... I really don't know what to think anymore, anyway jokes aside. Lyfa is the 2nd main character is (ALO) after Kirito. Now as a character she looks alright I guess, even though they threw some fan service with her mmm.. chest, she isn't really the best main character I see her a little bit weak and over dramatic, giving up everything for a guy is a sign of weakness, other than that she is an ok character I suppose, she is good at fighting and not as annoying as the other characters in (ALO). Now there is a character that does come back from (SAO) without spoiling much, in (ALO) this character is turned into a small fairy which is kinda silly if you ask me. And they turn this character from an emotional and lovable one, into a small annoying fairy. Other than those two you don't really see any important side characters, you have the guy with green hair, annoying, you have the chibi cat girl, really annoying, and just a bunch of random and non-important characters.
-Enjoyment- Well I can Honestly say that I really enjoyed watching the anime when it came out, looking forward for each week to see how the story is going to progress, I was so excited about it that I even recommended it to some of my friends to watch it. But then it just lost its spark and i became less interested by each episode. there were some parts where they shift from (ALO) to the real world, and actually I enjoyed the real world parts more than the ones in the game
-Overall- I myself am the kind of person who would watch an anime knowing that it is good, and just give it a 10 or 9 no matter what happens, but I don't know why Sword Art Online was different. The whole enjoyment was lost after season 1 and I was kind of disappointed.
I did compare (SAO) to (ALO) a lot in this review, but for a very good reason. I felt that the makers were just sloppy and wanted to increase their views with the second season, throwing alot of fan service and increasing the violence. It just seemed useless and really ruined the enjoyment for the anime. But you know this is just my opinion and I actually do recommend the anime, if you see that you wont get annoyed by the bad points I said about the anime in this review then you would probably really enjoy it. But as for me I would have hoped this anime ended sooner after the incident of (SAO) it could have ended there, and it would have been one of my favorite anime.",7
"
                I find the Love It or Hate It debate over this anime hilarious, but I also REALLY get it. On the one hand, this anime is beautiful. The art and sound production is fantastic, especially from a smaller studio. The action is (overall) very well done. They have a really good pace, and they feel frenetic and exciting. It doesn't just excel at action either, there are many genuinely touching moments in this series.
Of course, I can also see the hate. While they do a lot of little design things with the MMO concept, they don't do much in the overall story. The first season
                  is full of time skips that make you go, ""Wait what! All of that intervening time!"" The second season has excessive fanservice, and a change to the game makes it much less dramatic or intense. The show is very mixed, character-wise. On one end there's Suguha, who is easily the most developed character in the show, while still managing to be sympathetic, likable, and engaging. (Even if her subplot does give me the oogies.) Near the middle is Asuna, who starts off interesting, disappears for a while, reappears and is kinda meh, before growing into something better. But then, there are the problem characters. First off is the protagonist, Kirito. He feels REALLY inconsistent. Early on there's his loner thing, there's the people dying complex he develops, and there's his romance. Besides that...his personality seems to completely change depending on the episode, or sometimes scene, he's in. And the season two villain! My friend who got me into this show used to rave to me about how evil he was, and how much I'd hate him. He's half right. Dude's definitely evil, but after a while I gave up hating him. He's a cartoon. He's a silly caricature of what ""evil"" is. His motivations are weak, and he has absolutely no redeeming qualities. In other settings with different styles, that could work, but this show's tone clashes with that. You can only add so many Villain tropes to one character before they stop being empathetic, and once you can't even empathize with a character, your ability to like or dislike them is sorely diminished.
Overall, I liked Sword Ass (I mean Art) Online. I'm glad I saw it. It's pretty flawed, but the emotion and drive it presents combined with the fantastic action makes me enjoy it regardless. To me it feels like Gurren Lagann wearing a really shiny .hack/sign suit. That leads to the problem, however, that Gurren Lagann works as well as it does because it doesn't give a rat's ass about how it looks, or the believability of it's story. SAO lacks that quality to make up for it. What it really needs is to be dubbed and put on Toonami. Put it in with that crowd, and it's going to stick out, and in a good way. If you know you're someone who can't get over logical or character problems in a show, this isn't for you. But if you can dip yourself into this world and enjoy the emotional roller-coaster, it comes recommended.",8
"
                The basic idea is great. There is however multiple problems with the plot. Most of them are not explained yet. But some are just outright ridiculous. For instance, they are not supposed to feel pain, but you see them scream in pain when they get it. It's been 2 years, they shouldn't be any phantom pain left. 
The 2 main characters are Mary and Gary stu. Kirito eventualy a particular skill and the only justification about it is: he have the best reaction time of all the players. They specifically say that hes laid back for a front liner. He also took time to be
                  part of guild way lower level than him. So why is he the strongest? Magic probably, but there is no magic is SAO. So probably something along the line of Deus Ex Machina!
Asuna though makes more sense, she IS on the front line all the time and she actualy didnt lose time.
Now the lovey dovey part. I liked it for the most part. The one part i thought was particulary stupid was when they think they can transport something from the game into the real world. I mean, seriously? Are you THAT naive?
The worst part? The end for sure, it was the most wanna be epic ever. Sure there is one big punch before the end, ill give it to them, it was kinda of impossible to see coming since the hint they gave was very unclear. But still, that part was nice. But then there is the im-a-villain-i-want-to-fight-the-hero-one-on-one. Somehow it made sense. I mean, the guy is a Dongeon Master after all, i guess theatrical fight are part of it. Except it is rushed (in all the way possible). But still that wasnt so bad. But then it hapened, the pokemon part. Something bad is hapening! What can we do? USE THE POWER OF LOVE TO IGNORE EVERY LAWS OF PHYSICS AND LOGIC OF COURSE!
Overall, its not that bad, it just doesnt deserve that good of a rating. The plot is badly exploited (like every other tsundere) the ending was OK and predictabel (refer to my last parentese).
But you know what? Even though i dont like it much, im still going to watch it. Because i still have hopes for this. The ending is somewhat surprising considering half of the episodes aren't out yet, i am really curious about this.",6
"
                Sword Art Online!
Its a story about this awesome amazing character Kirito that is so awesome and overpowered! He meets this awesome guild leader Asuna! They adventure together and then get married! Then for some reason Asuna gets really really bad at fighting and gets captured! Kirito's cousin who has the hots for him team up to save Asuna in fairy land (i love fairies!) Then Kirito saves Asuna and they all are happy! This anime was so tense! At times I didn't think Kirito would make it out alive, but then I remembered Kirito was an amazing tough static character that could win any battle!
                  Hooray! Also there were so many forgettable characters in this show that I --- wait. I forgot what I was going to say.",4
"
                Sword Art Online the anime everyone is talking about. So i reckon I should write a review.
Personally, SAO has a great story plot and I dig the whole virtual reality gaming thing (as I am an avid gamer myself) The thing is the main story.....
Is all about this guy Kirito as we first know who is trapped in the game world and pitted into a death game. Well alot of people has been ranting on and on about the story not following the plotline and stuff. And that the santa claus boss and Silica with a tamagochi is very childish. But take Maple Story or
                  Dragonica (2 examples of rpg games) for example they are kinda childish too. But the main thing is the gameplay, storyline and whatnot.
Ok, I rated a 9 for sound as LiSA is just amazing and have never failed me once when she made a song. The art on the other hand is great too. The character background is ok well not as good. Ive heard many sayings that Kirito is just a mysterious guy and all we know about is he has a sister (well regarding the anime) and that Asuna is just too good to be true. As we the rpg gamers have never met a pretty and nearly perfect girl like Asuna.
But still I recmmend this anime to all the rpg gamers out there. I have rated this anime a 10 for overall enjoyment.",10
"
                I haven't read the manga, nor the novel, so please excuse that in advance. Also, the anime is still coming out, so I may be editing this review.
STORY: 
The plot, the idea of a VRMMORPG is unique in itself, although I will say it's something I have heard before. Of how the plot unravels: depends on how well the creators make it. At first, I was excited - episode one made me think that the protagonist, Kirito, would go on this huge, amazing journey, and we'd be able to see him grow and make heartwarming bonds. Well. I was extremely disappointed. So, moral is, don't
                  watch this anime if you're wanting to watch an anime with the plot I stated above. Go watch Inuyasha, or another adventure anime. Every episode pretty much had an entirely different storyline, almost like little oneshots, but with the same base - in the game, and with Kirito as the main character (of course). Every episode that has been released (12?), apart from the first few, introduced a girl that partied (in game terms) with Kirito, and maybe even fell in love with him. What's the first word that comes to mind? For me, it's 'harem'. Yup. That's what I think this anime is turning towards to. However, I also believe that maybe, these characters were introduced for a reason, and not just for the fun of it all. I'm hoping that in the end, when the main REAL plot is introduced, these side characters will be there.
I give the story a 7/10.
ART:
The art is absolutely amazing. The detail put into the backgrounds of each scene, the character designs, clothing, eyes, hair - just wow. It really creates the atmosphere. That's all I can say to it.
Art is a 10/10.
SOUND:
To be honest, I didn't really notice much of the soundtrack, which I guess, can be a good thing. Sure, the OP and the ED - which is subjective. In my opinion, they weren't amazing, probably mediocre, but they were fitting.
7/10.
CHARACTER:
As stated above, I was hoping to see an adventure where Kirito grew - mentally, and maybe physically too, as in leveling up. I wanted to see him actually get closer to the other characters little by little; and as stated before, I was extremely disappointed. Hopefully though, there will be more moments like that in the later episodes. The episodes currently out however, as well as the characters introduced made me annoyed. Sure, Kirito as the main character isn't the typical protagonist, actually, I like him. Asuna, the main heroine, is alright too. The side characters, as in, the temporary spotlight (usually a girl) of the episode, are the problems for me. Pretty much every girl, EVERY GIRL, Kirito encountered had a crush on him. They partied up for him for one mission/one goal, and after it's done they think they're in love. Certainly, there's no doubt - that this anime is turning into a harem, or most likely,  it already is one. The side characters don't stand out to me, sure they have at least one memorable feature in their appearance that I can name, but their names; their personalities - I have no idea. The characters (maybe the exception of Kirito) are pretty predictable. Even Asuna. I'm not expecting much now - at the end of one particular episode, I was asking myself - should I be touched, or crying my heart out or - at least, feeling something strong?
And so, character gets a 6/10.
ENJOYMENT:
I think, from the above statements, you can guess I'm not a huge fan of this series. I'm really hoping it'll pick up though.
6/10.
OVERALL:
Sword Art Online (SAO) gets a 6.",6
"
                I was compelled to write this review due to what I perceive to be the unfairly large amount of criticism thrown at SAO :). People seem to be criticising it for lazy storywriting and shallow characters, but I feel this is far from the truth. 
First, the story. The ""high level"" plot is not exactly hugely original, sure, and various stereotypical plot devices are employed to advance the story, but below this is, in my opinion, an interesting exploration of very serious themes. It attempts what I think is a quite honest exploration of the psychology and sociology associated with the main premise, that is,
                  large numbers of people being trapped in a virtual world where the risk of death is very real, for very long periods of time. I think the story shows quite a lot of insight into the human mind and is actually very good on this deeper level. So you might say the actual plot is fairly average, but the immersion and realness and exploration of themes is very good. Some of these themes get a bit lost in the latter half of the show, but it had other things going for it by that stage.
Now the characters. I don't know why people think they are shallow. Kirito is again, on the surface, something of a ""glove"" character for teenage boys to wear and fantasise about begin a hero, but below that we see a lot of psychological development. The scars he suffers from the various atrocities he witnesses were very believable to me, and the bonds he develops with the other characters likewise seemed heartfelt. On the top level, yes there is again a level of pandering to teenage boy fantasies to have pretty girls fawning over them, but the girls are not at all shallow empty characters whose sole role is to fawn over Kirito. They are each very likeable and have complex personalities (though yes it would have been nice to see some of their back stories developed further, since some of them aren't given much air time). Asuna of course one of the most developed, and it is a shame when she is reduced to the damsel in distress since she is such a strong character, but I love the rest of the show enough that I can overlook this cheap shot. For comparison, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time remains one of my most beloved games despite that it pulls the same crap on Zelda. The development of Kirito's sister Suguha in the latter half of the show was likewise excellent. She has a rough time and one feels all the feels for her.
Finally, the romance between Kirito and Asuna is one of the aspects the kept me glued to the screen, so that I watched the whole series in basically one sitting, though again I was sad that Asuna semi-disappeared in the latter part of the show, though this did make room for Suguha which was very worthwhile. I thought the addition of Yui was a nice touch and that she was a very likeable character on her own, and her presence was important to add the very serious question of how we would feel about a true artificial intelligence into the mix of themes.
As for other aspects of the show, I thought the art was great, and very evocative so far as really imagining what a virtual world might be like, and the music of Yuki Kajiura was excellent for amplifying the abundant feels of the show (though it is not as listenable for its own sake as her score for Madoka Magika).
This was one of the most enjoyable shows I have watched in quite a while, and so for that fact alone I am happy to give it a 10 overall. It's not the biggest win for feminism in the world like Madoka is, but there is more than enough there to make up for it. If you don't like this show and it doesn't make you cry then you have no soul (jk, sort of…).",10

*Although it hasn't finished airing I still decided to write a review because SAO is just awesome*
The story for SAO starts out with a new gaming system that has a headset you can use that will mentally bring you into the game. This method has brought gaming to a whole new level and its every gamer's dream to experience this, there's a catch though, you can no longer log out. You are now stuck in this game. Your life depends on completing this game, if you die in SAO you will also die in reality. So far SAO had
                  a cool feeling and also survival feeling. 
The art is good and all but I have seen better, which is Angel Beats, and so far no anime has beaten it in graphics wise. I did have one complaint about the art but its nothing serious but its the fact that in the game there was no blood. It does make sense that it has no blood but I personally feel it should've.
The opening theme for SAO is very good in my opinion, I really like the song and I for one isn't really a fan for Japanese music. The voice actors are also great, so I give it a 10.
The characters are very good in this game, they're mostly likable. The two main characters are the most liked of them all, they're personalities aren't generic.
Overall SAO is very good so far and I'm looking forward to the upcoming episodes. I actually recommend this to everyone because so far those who have watched this has really enjoyed it and I haven't seen any complaints so everyone should give SAO a try.",10
"
                I'm going to try and make a spoiler free review here, it does have a FEW spoilers but those are very minor, like characters appearing and so on.
The MC is the typical guy that doesn't talk much, somehow has the power to outperform anyone and do impossible moves at critical times with almost no effort and is surrounded by female characters that all want him.
There's forced drama very early in the anime (the crystal part, that was hilarious). After the first arc it all goes to the shitter, it turns into a forced romance anime with a second MMO world suddenly appearing with no real
                  death and therefore no suspension. But you can fly, sugoi!
Yui is completely out of place to the point where I ask myself why kayaba, the main antagonist, would make an AI have the body of a little girl with the wish to play house with kirito and his girl near the end of the first arc. She has no point existing in the first place. 
The main antagonist's motives were never properly explained. He's just a microwave killer for the sake of a floating dream castle.
There's way more, but that stuff wouldn't be spoiler free. However, the soundtrack was pretty good even though it always used the same tracks at certain scenes.
Overall, pretty badly done anime, would not watch.",3
"
                The infamous Sword Art Online. Many people hate this anime and others would argue it is one of the best anime out there, defending it with their lives.   
Story - 6 
Many expected the story to be one of the strongest points in this show just by reading the synopsis or seeing the first episode, it ultimately falls short. Filled with lots of time skips and what one could call ""filler"" episodes it creates a lot of WTF is happening moments. The death penalty is used early on but on characters that viewers don't even have time to connect to. The penalty becomes
                  even weaker when later in the series (SPOILER) Kirito and Asuna are ""killed"" fighting the last boss, but are okay in the real world. The death aspect gets thrown aside in the second arc.
Art - 9 
The art was wonderful and the animation was very fluid when there were fights. The lighting was also very good but some episodes it just didn't show and made the atmosphere feel inconsistent at times.
Sound - 7
The sound fit well but nothing really stuck out other than the first op.
Character - 4
Due to the importance of the main protagonist Kirito, many of the other more interesting characters were pushed to the side.
Supporting characters such as Klein don't get much screen time, even though he started off seeming like a companion for our protagonist, he gets pushed to the side after the first episode.
Asuna, the heroine, starts off mysterious and antisocial being the only other player without a person to party up during the meeting for the attack on the first boss. She is also quite a good player, in the very same episode she appeared in, she and our main protagonist defeat the first boss. She seems to be shaping up as a badass heroine but later in the series becomes the damsel in distress to show how amazing our protagonist is. Although she seems to be renowned for her lightning fast speed and her skills she doesn't seem very powerful when Kirito is on the screen.
Kirito is our main protagonist and the perfect example of a Gary Stu, being able to crush bosses with little to no help, bosses that would normally take out dozens of players. He starts out well enough being a young, socially awkward teen who gets thrown into a game of death, but later he seem to be able to get all of the girls he meets to fall for him even though he doesn't have any standout qualities other than being super overpowered. 
The relationship of our two main characters is one of ""romance."" It's obvious that they are going to end up together but it happens quite suddenly, with no real development before hand. Many romance anime have it so that the main couple don't really end up together until the end, making it seem unrealistic, but SAO probably would have been better off having Kirito and Asuna as friends until the end of the second arc. Forcing Kirito to realize how much she means to him.
Enjoyment - 7
Although I have problems with the characters and the lack of importance of the death penalty, I enjoyed the show only noticing these flaws when I re-watched it.
Overall - 6
The story is weak, and the characters ""decent"" but if you are looking for an anime that can give you a dark, breathtaking atmosphere with an interesting concept SAO is a good one to try.",6
"
                Story: In terms of plot, Sword Art Online has a decent one that can keep a person on their seat to learn more on what will happen. The side stories make the story drag a little but the side stories do give a lot on character development especially Sachi, who contributes greatly to Kirito's mindset. The general plot does drag on though so it takes a while for the real action to focus back on the real story due to the side stories. 
Art: Art is pretty good considering that I never watch any anime with bad graphic style unless it has an amazing storyline.
                  The characters are well-drawn, the effects and scenery are well defined. The hexagonal cells that make up the Virtual World is an interesting touch especially the death animations.
Sound: Battle music is okay, OP and ED are both pretty good and fit well with the story, and the sound effects of weapons and items are good as well.
Character: Main character is Kirito, a soloist with dark reasons as to why he would be a solo, so the dark past is quite a good touch, though it's quite cliche at the same time. Asuna is the heroine who is quite the standard heroine except for the fact that she wields a rapier and can turn a man into a shish kebab in seconds. She's got flare so it makes good character. Romance is not built well though so I can see why people criticize their relationship. Side characters from the story do have distinct personalities so it makes an interesting bunch.
Enjoyment: It's highly enjoyable if you like action. However, do not look for romance in this anime.
Overall: It's got a plot and a certain fast-paced style in battles and slow style outside battles. It gives morals lessons as well as lessons on humanity so that is a plus. Depending on whether it reaches the Guns Gale Online arc, it might have a chance to develop even further in terms of philosophical lessons on life.",8
"
                I rethought this anime and decided to downgrade it to a 5. I can't rake this higher than Blast of Tempest or Eureka Seven...as flawed as those anime are...
Story 5: I’ll divide this section into two parts: “What it could have been” and “what we actually got”
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN: The premise is awesome; it’s World of Warcraft meets The Matrix. The protagonist is stuck with 10,000 other players in a Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game called “Sword Art Online” where you can’t log out and if you die in the game you die in real life. 
Mission: Clear all 100 levels
                  and everyone who is still alive in the game will be logged out. Solid right?
The first episode did a good job anticipating and then answering many of the questions a rational viewer might have about the premise of an action/romance anime in cyberspace. For example:
Q: What if you die, can’t you just respawn?
A: No, your brain will get fried in real life
Q: Can’t someone in the real world just pull your headgear off?
A: No, see previous answer
Q: Why is all this happening?
A: Mad Scientist…stop asking questions
Q: So they’re all trapped…how on Earth can the protagonist possibly distinguish himself amongst 10k other players?
A: He’s was a beta-tester and most of the other 10k players are complete noobs
Q: Ok…Ok…the protagonist has an edge but let’s say he happens to fall in love with a girl in the game, how do you KNOW for sure that she’s really a hot gamer chick and not a balding sex-offender? 
A: Everyone (for no logical reason) looks like their real selves in the game.
You can see how everything just falls into place to allow an ordinary dude who is good at video games to evolve into a legit badass. Sure the set up was a little cheesy and there were a couple of times I wanted to roll my eyes but it could have been a really cool story. 
They also use the premise to ask a few interesting questions.
-Is in-game love real? Would it last in the real world?
-What happens when you spend years (I’m not joking) in a game? Do you forget what the real world is like?
-Is your online personality a reflection of who you really are?
-Can human willpower fight programming?
Cool huh?
WHAT WE ACTUALLY GOT: My main problem is the poor pacing of the series and the entire second story arc. The first arc moved too fast and disjointedly. We literally jump around 3+ months at a time between episodes. This means that the character development, the “becoming a badass” and the “falling in love” (aka the meat of an action/romance anime) get skipped over in a bad way. It’s like they are trying to show that these things don’t happen overnight (i.e. over the course of years) but they don't realize that by omitting great spans of time they end up not showing us anything at all. They also insist on adding a few filler episodes and “slice of life” moments in the first arc which makes everything else that much more rushed. 
The second arc is really bad. I’m not going to give you any specific spoilers but they pretty much shit on the entire premise of the first arc. It picks up again at the end I guess but the damage has already been done.
 Let me just say this, if they had scrapped the second arc altogether and used those 12 episodes to enrich the first I don’t think I would have any complaints. Story-wise this anime went the way of Gantz: great premise, poor follow-through.
Art 9: I have no complaints, it was beautiful. I thought the landscapes were really cool. The premise gave them a lot of freedom to make crazy environments for the characters. This was the strongest point of the anime.
Sound 9: Music was actually pretty good. The fight music was well done and I thought the intro/ending songs were well above average.
Character 5: The main characters were stale and underdeveloped. Everything keeps coming down to that second arc which changed Kirito from a lone, wandering swordsman to just a role-playing nerd with ADHD. When you get to any of the later episodes (when they start talking about the “Salamanders”) just ask yourself this, “What the fuck is he doing?” 
The character development of the females in this anime is stunted. The best case is Asuna, who started off very promising but quickly fell into the damsel in distress role. There was so much potential to for them to make this relationship about a serious, mutual struggle for survival too. Such a shame. 
Enjoyment 5: Look, Everyone knows that the second half of Death Note was not as good as the first half but the series still rocked. Unfortunately, the second half of SAO killed it for me. If you are looking for a clever series this is not it.
Overall 5: I couldn't get past the wasted opportunities and the fragmented plot. The main character was just too annoying to like or relate to. 
Violence/Gore: Very little blood but many character deaths
Love/Romance: Heartwarming but rushed. It could have been better.
Sex/Nudity: lol, cleavage and a PG tentacle scene. Both of which were silly.",5

                *CONTAINS SPOILERS*
Plot
A bunch of people playing an MMORPG called Sword Art Online are trapped within the game by it's creator, Kayaba, and they have to complete 100 levels if they want to get out and free everyone else. Simple right? How could something so simple turn into such a massive travesty? Well Reki Kawahara found a way. What was supposed to be a show about building up an army to beat this game and to see how the characters grew, turned into the stupidest .//Hack fanfiction i have probably ever seen in my entire life, and i'm not even that big on .//Hack either.
                  This is like a 15 year olds self insert story where all the ladies want him, beats every boss by himself (Do that in an mmo and you get your balls rocked.) Solves all the mysteries, guys want to be him and thinks he's super cool, and all the villains are jealous of him. OH, and he gets all the best stuff, imagine that huh?...what do you mean Reki Kawahara wrote this at 15 and didn't change it at all because he's a lazy ass?
Pacing
There are multiple unnecessary time skips within this show that overall aid in the travesty that is it's plot and there are way too many episodes that literally don't accomplish crap and are just there for the writers wish fulfillment.
Characters
Oh my god....this is literally...the worst part...of this show...Can i just...move on to this already...please? ok...
-Kirito
This smegma biter is the main protagonist of this stain on anime. And voiced by Rice Paperbag (Bryce Papenbrook). This is how you don't write characters 101. He is everything you should avoid when writing how a character is supposed to be. He is depicted to be perfect, when he is just a misogynistic, unfaithful asshole. He also comes back from the dead. I'm not fucking kidding. To point out all his flaws, i'm going to start from the SAO arc, to the end of the ALO arc. Be prepared for A LOT of reading.
SWORD ART ONLINE
First off, Kirito wasn't always perfect. He actually made a mistake once, a very dire one leading to the end of Sachi's and many other peoples lives. This was a set up to something VERY GOOD. But then we get slapped in the face after that. Kirito never makes a mistake after this. NEVER. He is also labeled as a ""beater"" a beta tester/cheater. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. Everyone knows how important beta testers are to a game, and the fact that people are mad at him because he has a lot of knowledge on the game because of this also makes no sense. HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE GAME, GO TO HIM FOR HELP, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? ugh...Anyway. Stupid filler bullcrap happens where he just meets random no name girls that add absolutely nothing to the plot whatsoever. These girls only know him for a day and they fall in love with him. STUPID. I'm going to leave out the stupid romance until I get to Asuna. He doesn't even play his role as a lone wolf right, terrible reasoning or not. He is always with someone in every episode of this show. And the show tries to shove down your throat that he isn't good with people, when that is absolute horse shit. He is misogynistic as all hell. He is in no way loyal to Asuna when he has all these girls on his junk and lets them do it. He treats one Liz like absolute shit, the 2nd waifu we meet in this anime. He comes in, breaks her best sword, tells the bitch to make him a new sword, she agrees, and somehow this turns into her falling in love with him....huh? This is the stupid shit i'm talking about...ugh...Later on we meet Yui, our walking Deus Ex Machina that i will get to later. Kirito and Asuna take in Yui after finding her lying unconscious. Events happen and she is revealed to be an NPC and she sacrificed herself to protect Kirito and Asuna and out of absolutely nowhere, Kirito reveals that he is a hacker and he hacked Yui's data into his nerve gear...*flips table* FUCKING NO. THERE WAS NOTHING ALLUDING TO THIS AT ALL, HE JUST PULLED THIS OUT OF HIS ASS. Oh my god...So after that bullcrap. Kayaba was hiding himself as one of the players known as Heath Cliff, who has aided Kirito and the others throughout this arc. He was pretty cool, till we (me and my friends who watched this travesty at the time) found out he was Kayaba. We also find out the BS reason as to why Kirito is the only person who can duel wield ""Because he has the fastest reflexes in the game"" -Kayaba
of course...So Jesus and Kayaba duel so that we can end this buttmess of a plot and the people trapped can get on with their lives. During this fight, Kayaba makes it so that nobody in the surrounding area can move so they don't interfere with their fight. Kayaba wrecks his shit, and is about to kill him, when Asuna takes the blow for him, IN SOME STUPID ASS WAY SHE CAN MOVE, BUT DOESNT USE HER SWORD TO BLOCK HIS ATTACK. Bad attempt at drama. Conveniently, Asuna's sword stays there on the ground after she disappears and kirito can't get to his. So with barely any strength left, Kirito stabs Kayaba with Asuna's sword killing him instantly...AFTER DYING BUT AGAIN FOR SOME STUPID REASON HE CAME BACK TO LIFE TO KILL HIM. This is one reason why he is called jesus, the 2nd reason will be here shortly. So after pulling his jesus moment, he dies again. But he gets to some after death area with Virgin Mary over here and Kayaba. They say their goodbyes, and Kirito and Asuna come out of this alive...but Kayaba for some stupid reason doesn't. TWIN JESUS.
...oh you thought i was done with Kirito? Honey, that was only one part.
FAIRY POOP ONLINE(Alfheim Online)
You know this is going to be especially bad when the die hard fans of this show even hate this arc...let's just get this stupid shit over with...
So after finding out Virgin Mary is in a coma for no reason, he decides to jump back into another NerveGear online mmo...right after the events of SAO...Stupid. Kawahara shows that he knows nothing about MMO's by transferring all of his Skills from SAO to ALO. Therefore, you already know the outcome of this arc from the very beginning. He meets Lyfa (i think that's how you spell cow udders online name, i just really don't care.) Who happens to be his sister/cousin in real life, which he doesn't know about until way later. Kirito  comes in, saves her ass from grunts, yada yada yada same stupid bullcrap that happened in the last arc NEXT. Lyfa for some reason leaves her guild to join kirito for no reason...SOUND FUCKING FAMILIAR? (Asuna did the same shit.) We meet more Best at X Harem members that don't contribute to the plot that want Kirito's nads for no reason other than he's good at the game. In ALO, your avatar isn't what you look like in real life. These 2 could be fat ass old men for all we know. Yui (oh yeah she comes back, more on that later) helps him throughout the rest of it. This whole arc is basically filler until the end. Asuna was in a coma because Sugou, the villain of this retarded arc, trapped her in ALO somehow (Never goes into detail). When Kirito finds this out, he rushes to save Asuna, but gets his balls rocked by all the guards in the tower. Then he starts touting shit like ""I tried to go past all the limits of the game"" which he did MULTIPLE FUCKING TIMES. After the stupid incestuous subplot ends after that scene, Lyfa/Suguha gives him her sword so he can duel blade, then he pulls out this random ass comet move out of nowhere to blast through the guards. DEUS EX MACHINA, THIS SHOW IS FULL OF IT. Kirito gets to the top of the tower and the stupid boss fight happens. But for some reason, Kirito starts boasting about how much of a great man Kayaba was, and how he was brave and never ran away. That's right Kirito, praise a man who killed thousands of people. Sugou wrecks his shit and starts raping Asuna in front of him (This was incredibly unneeded by the way) Then a vision of Kayaba comes before him and grants him god like powers to which he reduces Sugou's pain absorber to zero, and maliciously attacks him in a disgusting way instead of ending him with one quick slash. Our hero ladies and gentlemen. After that bullcrap. He exits his NervGear and starts TALKING TO SUGUHA FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN TO FORCE THIS STUPID ASS INCESTUOUS LOVE TRIANGLE WHEN SUGOU COULD BE AT THE HOSPITAL BY NOW, KILLING ASUNA. MOST LIKELY BY CAR.
And guess what, minus the murdering, this is what fucking happens. Kirito's skills in SAO also somehow transferred into real life. If your body hasn't done something before, it won't know how to do it. Kawahara can't write what's new?
Kirito lets Sugou go because he's SUCH A GOOD PERSON. He meets up with Asuna, they kiss, stupid 5min scene after that and the show is FINALLY OVER. OH MY GOD. AND NOW I HAVE TO DO THE OTHER DUMBASSES IN THIS SHOW OH MY FUCKING---
Asuna
well aren't you the most inconsistent character in this series?
Asuna goes from quiet reserved girl, to loud-commanding leader of a guild Tsundere, to a lovey-dovey waifu who just sits at home cooking for kirito (i am not being sexist, this is actually what fucking happens). These personality changes are never shown to be sparked by anything thanks to the pointless and stupid time skips in the show. She's supposed to be a front liner and literally the 2nd strongest person in the game, but she is always needing saving by Kirito as the plot progresses. She plays the common house wife/damsel in distress who spouts cliche shounen nonsense to kirito that you would hear in Bleach in any other day of the week. She is in love with Kirito for literally no reason. They paired up once, and that was around the time of him becoming a ""Beater"" (Still the stupidest shit). They meet up again after a year, decide to fuck, and they get...married? wut. wat. FUCKING DUMBASS ROMANCE. Then the show tries to play on this with her character that she is so madly in love with him when she barely even knows anything about him, and the fact that after she gets married to him she starts worrying about what age he is and if Kirito is even his real name (It's not). After just one night of knowing Yui she feels in inseparable bond with her and the day she dies she's all like ""I WILL NEVER SMILE AGAIN IF YOU DIE"". YOU HARDLY EVEN KNOW HER, SHE'S NOT YOUR REAL DAUGHTER, AND SHE'S NOT EVEN A REAL PERSON. Then she goes on to say that she's changed as a person and that everything she's done in the game is because she was with Kirito...i'm going to leave that up to you reader because this is some stupid shit i don't even want to touch up on. How not to write character development 101.
There is nothing for me to write anymore on her. She doesn't do anything in Fairy Poop Online so that's it for her.
Yui (Deus Ex Machina)
Ugh...my god...Ok. NPC with amnesia. Kirito and Asuna found her which was said earlier. She decides to live with them and the day after she gets her memories back out of nowhere, nothing sparked this, and she uses her godlike mod powers to protect Kirito and the others. blablabla Nerve Gear data yeah yeah yeah explained earlier.
Fairy Poop Online is when it gets super stupid with this character.
Kirito just so happens to have her data transferred over into ALO and this turns her from an NPC, to an omniscent Navigation Fairy that is supposed to know how to get to places, but instead she knows almost everything about the game and loses omniscience when the plot calls for it. Dumb Deus Ex Character that has no point being here only to be the loli bait in this show.
Kayaba
This nigga forgot the whole reason he did everything he did. killed thousands and forgot why ""To see some castle or some shit"" basically. (By the way i totally don't look like Rintarou Okabe from Steins;Gate)
Sugou
You have as much depth as a villian as a first generation power rangers villain. As soon as you see him you no damn well he is the villain of Fairy Poop Online. His role is that he's going to marry Asuna, even though she's in a coma, he's going to marry her anyway...you see why the fans hate this arc now right? So he's going to trap people in ALO so he can control their SOULS (Nobody knows what this means and it's never given any detail). He is irredeemable in every way so that the fans will root for Kirito when he inevitably slaughters him. He rapes Asuna in the game, he has really no motivation for anything he does other than being evil for the sake of being evil, and he was only thought of with little to no thought because Reki was thinking ""hurr these retards will pay to see anything"".
Suguha
Nobody likes you. She is also one of the Best at X harem members because she is one of the best people on her Kendo team, and is only here to force a terrible love triangle the show didn't need...
Liz
Best at X Harem Member who does nothing at all to advance the plot. Axe Master and Master Blacksmith Just gives Kirito a new sword because she's SO IN LOVE WITH HIM (Bullshit).
Alicia Rue
Best at X Harem Member who does nothing at all to advance the plot. Leader of a clan. Just comes to aid Kirito near the end but barely does shit during it.
Sakuya
Best at X (DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS? THIS IS GOING TO BE THE REST OF THE CHARACTERS)
I'm done because the rest are just Best at X Harem Members
Story
Pretty much went through it all with the characters. It is shit. Moving on.
Sound
This Soundtrack is too good for this piece of crap. Especially if it's from Fate/Zero's composer.
Visuals
Nice Backgrounds, but the animation can be so fucking lazy.

                I gave the review a 9 at first. After that I watched people's reviews, I read the light novel, and gave some rewatch, I take it down to 7. It's still one of my favorite anime and it's still fun to rewatch, but this is the kind of anime that you watch along with your meal, skip to the action part maybe, and just chill. This is not one that you try to immerse into the story.
Story: 5
Full-dive VR MMORPG turned into a death game of some sort caused by the developer whim(?). The setting is good, with despair portrayed by the breakdown of the
                  player when the developer was explaining the flair of the game. What's not to like? And boom, a lot of ""side quest"" appear which leads the story to strays further from the main plot. It then tried to get back into the main plot, succeed in my opinion, and boom, strays even further. The worst thing that I noticed is there's a little story that is in the light novel but they didn't adapt to the anime, but they mentioned.
Art: 10
This is one of the selling point of SAO. The art is so good. Fantasy world of 100 floors dungeon with cities for the players to live, monster zone for grinding, dungeon to look for the boss and move to next level. All is drawn with absolute beauty that is certain to make anobody (or at least anobody that's a gamer) to think ""I wanna be there!"". The battle scene is so top tier to make anyone watching to drop their jaw. This is the one that got me hook, line, and sinker.
Sound: 10
Imagine Pirate's of Carribean battle scene with that iconic theme song. Or Sephiroth's One Winged Angel. This is what it felt like for me. I always loved classical music or some choir music of some sort that make a battle scene to be twice intense. Then you see a lake at the country side with trees and blue sky, paired with some chill harp instrument playing that calm your soul. All of that is enveloped by top tier opening and ending songs. This anime really spoil your ears.
Character: 3
Main character is too overpowered. Yes, he got some experience from the beta test (explained from the start), but he started from zero again like everyone else. He tried to be some lone wolf but somehow all girls fell in love to him ""at first sight"". The girls hold little significant to the story and felt like they're there just to make a harem to the MC. Most of the characters are there like only on one episode somehow disappear. 
Enjoyment: 7
This is a bit hard. You will really enjoy this if you just shut your brain and just watch it for the godly battle scenes. But because it really emphasize the story from the beginning, you definitely will seek it, and that's where you'll be dissapointed. If this is a game, this is one of that game you play for its high graphic, cool gameplay, but not the story. If you really want to know the story it's better to read the light novel.
Overall: 7
Despite what other people said, I will still recommend this anime to watch. After all even with all that negative points, it's still fun to watch.",7

                Sword Art Online (SAO) was one of the most anticipated anime of 2012. To be brutally honest with you, I waited so bad for this anime's release. I had even set up my desktop background as a SAO picture before the anime was even aired! In the end, my expectations were severely shattered; Sword Art Online...is not that great. The reason why I thought Sword Art Online was going to be a very good anime, is by looking at the whole concept of the story:
""In the near future, a Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online has been released where
                  players control their avatars with their bodies using a piece of technology called Nerve Gear. One day, players discover they cannot log out, as the game creator is holding them captive unless they reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, if they die in the game, they die in real life. Their struggle for survival starts now...""
I mean, doesn't that sound so interesting? It sounded like no anime I've ever watched before, well thats as far as I can remember it (P.S I've heard of .hack series, but I've never watched it.)
Anyway, I'll just continue to ramble about how ""good"" the anime can get...
The first few episodes wasn't that bad, It was satisfactory. But not superb. It was episodes which I could still expect a lot in the next coming episodes of the series. But then at one point, the fun and joy quickly fades, and boredom starts kicking in. The whole MMO-style action which I thought was a cool and unique idea at first; characters have life-bars, levels, experience and all that Online RPG type stuff, but then in the end, nearly all of the battles are a total bore, uninteresting and dull. At one point, I'd nearly fell asleep watching one of the episodes! 
The more episodes I watch, the more boring the whole series gets. Even my friend who've  continuously told me to continue watching the series promising that it'll be good(He's a total SAO fanboy), didn't help me to continue watching this anime. Even the amount of hot anime girls(There's a lot!) didn't help me to continue watch the anime. Seeing the protagonist, Kirito, defeating his enemies with one-hit moves gets old very quickly. The story also is quite shallow.
The romance part? The relationship between Kirito and Asuna (Sorry if this was considered as a spoiler to you) was quite unrealistic. They met one day, form a ""dungeon party""(its something quite common in Online RPGs, you should google them for your sake if you don't know) to kill a powerful dungeon boss. They were victorious, Kirito's party defeated the dungeon boss. He then left the party and suddenly few years later in the game, Kirito and Asuna met each other again. Suddenly, They fell in love. This is why I've found the whole romance between them to be quite unrealistic.
The two good things I've found in the whole series? Both the opening theme and ending theme songs are very, very good. ""Crossing Field"" sung by Lisa is probably one of the best Opening theme I've listened in 2012. The second good thing is the art and graphics are splendid. The art and coloring of the whole anime is nice. The soft but bright coloring of the art leaves a nice pleasant feel to the eyes.
Final Verdict on Sword Art Online? One Word: Maybe. SAO might work for you but It didn't for me. But do you know the number of Sword art online fans exists today? There's helluva lot! So..in my opinion, you should, at the very least, give SAO a try. I know I stopped watching the whole series at just the 14th episode, but I don't think continuing is going to help, so I'll stop watching the series while I'm still sane.",6
"
                full of plot holes, too many time skips and over hyped.
Sword art online was a great concept at first with the first few episodes being great and making me want more and the amazing 1st opening helped greatly. but unfortunately it seems that the person behind this anime is better at comng up with ideas than creating the entire thing as, the pacing kills it in the end.
Personally I would recommend accel world instead, it was made by the same team, but was far better
              ",4
"
                By now everybody is pretty much aware of what Sword Art Online is and what it brings to the table. So I'm not going to write a review as such, as I've seen many people negatively criticizing it I'm going to write a response as to why I really enjoyed it, I personally thought it was great, despite its shortcomings, and I'll admit SAO had many. 
I really dug the story. Or the premise at least. The whole VMMORPG thing really appealed to me. Not only because I like to consider myself an avid MMORPGer type person. But it also really helped to present the
                  story in a somewhat realistic way. I really got into it. I personally didn't have any qualms during the SAO arc at all. Next to the seemingly dispensable ""heroins"" that kept appearing. That I thought, was an issue. 
I do agree with most of the other reviewers that the ALO arc was a little all over the place. It had lost a little of what I had found appealing in the first arc. That sense of wonderment and awe that I found my self feeling time and again whilst Kirito spent his two years in Sword Art Online. But despite all that I still found myself having a great time watching this anime. 
That's what it really comes down to. I've read what other people have said in regards to SAO and I agree with a lot of the points that have been presented (including the negative ones) But what this anime came down to for me was how much fun I was having watching this. Yes, it is over-rated, Yes, it was over-hyped. But you know what? I lost myself in the world, I lost myself in Sword Art Online. Maybe a little even in Alfheim as well. And to me, that's what matters in the end. How much damn fun I had whilst I got to watch this Anime.",6
"
                I will start my review by sating that I never even heard of SAO until very recently. I had started watching Accel world, when my girlfriend interrupted my viewing of it and forced to watch Sword Art Online, which in her opinion is a better show. I never got the chance to finish Accel world (I promise I'll get to it later) but I was able to enjoy and finish SAO. 
The second thing that I think I should add before I start my review is that I am not a professional critique so if you expect that I will have the semantics to write
                  a professional critique then this is not the review for you to read.
 Why do you watch anime? Do you go crazy after every plot hole that you found? Do you cringe at any clichee that you see?
The reasons that I watch anime is very simple, I watch it as pure entertaiment. Nothing more and nothing less. If I feel like the show moved me in a certain way, then I will give the show the appropriate score. So with that being said, let's break down my opinion on the show.
Characters
I like Kirito as a main character. I do admit that he's generic, but there was a few moments where he suprised me with his action. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will say that though Kirito is a chick magnet, he doesn't seem to be completely clueless about his surroundings. He's a very nice guy who want to help as many people as he can, this is an attractable quality so you have girls rushing and falling in love with him. That part of the show didn't bother me until later, which I'll get to, but overall Kirito handled himself well in my opinion.
Asuna in my opinion is the star of the show... i'm sure I will get heat for that, but the show didn't really get serious until Asuna became a constant in the show.  I will admit, I wasn't too fond of her in the beginning. Her personality was inconsistent in my opinion, but later I began to accept that. Real people don't have consistent personalities, some days are different than others, and I began to view Asuna as the person that she is, it became very easy to like her.
Suguha.....she's the little sister..you don't bang the little sister
Sound
I loved the soundtrack. The background music was eerily similar to tsubasa chronicles, in the way that some of the instrument was used. I probably liked the soundtrack better than anything else.
Story
I've seen enough anime to be able to not really be suprised by any plot twist or plot holes. That being said, in my opinon, the excecution of the show was great, I enjoyed every moment. From the beginning to the end, I was constantly pleasantely suprised. I never expected this show to be a code geass, or a full metal alchemist...so little plot holes don't bother. The story was coherent and I enjoyed it, enough said.
Overall
Definitely a great show, I don't know whether I would accept another season..I mean what can me more menacing and urgent then being stuck in a game where dying means literal death. It doesn't get more urgent than that, so I wonder how they will spice up other seasons. 
But overall I give this show a 10/10, and I do recommend this show to people that are willing to watch romance, and some pretty cool action scenes.",10
"
                Firstly i should mention that i may edit the review as the anime progresses and as I'm not really good at writing reviews please forgive me if my review isn't really good :X
Story: 8
Story is definitely decent, with good storyline and decent plot. The way the story progresses is also fine although it would be better if the side stories were slightly longer although i guess they don't have enough episodes to do it. There's enough excitement and action and although in very small amounts, a certain degree of mystery and suspense. While I would like it if the fights weren't too short, it's still
                  fine.
Art: 7 
Well not really much to say here. Background isn't bad and the way they portrayed the scenery and landscape was pretty good. Character designs were also decent. My complaint here would be that why does Kirito always look like some crazed maniac/lunatic everytime he fights seriously? Well i understand that in a real fight people would make similar expressions but still....
Sound: 9
Nothing to complain here. The BGM suits each situation appropriately and the OP and ED are really great. Although the ED doesn't really fit the anime but well its still nice to listen to. 
Characters: 9
The characters here are pretty great although i would prefer if there were more guys(I'm not saying the characters here are bad i just meant that there should be a few more guys or it just doesn't seem realistic). I especially like the main male and female protagonists as the male protagonist doesn't start out as some useless guy who suddenly becomes invincible in a short period of time and is actually quite capable on his own while at the same time not being completely overpowered. As for the main female protagonist, she is actually helpful and actually does help out the other characters alot unlike some female characters we see in some anime here and there that just comes into a fight and becomes a complete burden.
Enjoyment: 9
Ok I admit. I gave this 2 extra points as I am quite the hardcore gamer (although I'm not really into MMORPGS) and being able to play a game in a completely virtual environment (excluding the part where you die for real if you get killed in the game) is something that I would like to do. Also, while the fight scenes could be alot better, they aren't actually bad.
Overall: 8
Hmm this anime is actually quite overrated and it really gets alot more credit than it actually deserves. However, just because it's overrated doesn't mean it's bad. Although i say it isn't spectacular, it's definitely good and worth watching.",8

                MMORPG is a popular type of game for many online users, since it provides a way for players to interact with one another thus creating an environment that closely resemble reality. To have a form of society, an economy, and leaders that will lead their people to a better future are elements of mmorpg that is presented in Sword Art Online. SAO incorporate these elements and use them to their fullest by giving it players a sense of superiority in a sense that people with a high level and skill can gain the power, which is difficult to grasp, and make the impossible, possible. This
                  anime present a world where it users are trapped within a game and have to reach the one hundredth floor in order to escape. Checked, it has a definite plot and a goal for the protagonists to achieve, but it is more in depth in terms of the way each moment of the anime is presented. SAO present to the viewers only the important moments this the anime only capture the best parts of the SAO experience, and of Kirito's journey. And yes, the anime does skip some scenes that might have benefited characterization, but there are other scenes that are unnecessary to the overall plot thus removing it would have little impact to the flow of the story. The story-line is fast pace; sometimes skipping a few months in between each episode, but doing so seems reasonable since it is not possible to win the game in twenty five days where your life is on the line. 
When considering characterization, the anime has done well; the characters have their own personal features which make them different from one another. Kirito and Asuna might be the two leading characters, but there are other minor characters which expand the cast greatly. With more characters, it would be expect to be difficult to maintain individualism in each character as well as give them equal show-time, yet SAO might have not done the best in this area. Kirito and Asuna have the most show-time thus the camera rarely ever points toward the other characters. They might make an appearance here and there, such as Agil, yet they do not fully participate in the story. This way of using characters have it low and high. The low is the characters are less developed and we know less about each one of them. The high is it is a great way to strengthen the romance between Kirito and Asuan thus giving each a more concrete character and we can't help but to admire them. Romance between two people would not be so great if they are constantly surrounded by other characters. Kirito and Asuna are considered by many to be ""perfect"" beings in a sense that they have no flaw. Most people in the world want to become that perfect being, but can never do such that since we all have flaws that can and cannot be fixed. SAO characters, especially Kirito and Asuna, embody such ideas in a way that makes us admire them. Who said anime have to side with reality?
The art of SAO is one of the best in anime. In the first five minute of the anime, you can see clearly how SAO detach itself from many other anime by presenting art that would leave you speechless. The art is consistent and maintain its great graphic throughout each episode thus strengthening the anime overall. On the other hand, when it comes to sounds it is simply amazing. The OP and ED songs come artists who know how grab your attention. The songs are worth listening to since not only are they have a good beat in them, but also the lyrics embody meaningful messages. The songs connect with the anime thus there is no awkward transition when going from the OP to the story and vice versa with ED. 
Putting everything aside, the entertainment section of the anime is outstanding. The plot gives the anime opportunity to create fight scenes which are very well made and eye catching. When watching this anime, you are not just watching it, but actually in the anime. The world of SAO is a world where people dream become reality and the fact is most people want such a world to exist. With an interesting plot, great graphics, and very likable characters,  SAO fails to lose any point in enjoyment but maintain a steady rating throughout each episode.
The anime goes beyond the boundary and present many issues and messages. One of them being the struggle people face when they are tied down between the world of reality and the virtual world. Which world is technically better? Asuna made an important reference to that question in the anime by wishing she could live in SAO forever and lead a peaceful life. This is one of the many themes that are presented within the anime and astray the anime away from just being a typical anime. 
SAO continues to better itself and leaves an imprint in the anime world; gaining both fans and critics.",10
"
                   I have seen many clashing opinions when it comes to Sword Art Online (SAO). Some proclaim it to be the the greatest show to ever graze the anime community, while others find it to be an absolute abomination to society. I personally disagree with both of these opinions. SAO obviously isn't a perfect anime and it has many flaws, but it is still an enjoyable show none the less, and it definitely was interesting to watch.
Plot: 4/10
With such an intriguing premise and a great first episode, one would think that it could only improve from there. However, the anime goes downhill from
                  that point and honestly gets really confusing. I found myself frequently stopping the episode I was currently watching to make sure I didn't skip an episode, until I realized that the anime went through insane time skips that just didn't make any sense. During one episode, Kirito would be on one floor (the game he's in consists of 100 floors, or levels, that the players must persist through one at a time in order to complete the game.) with a group of allies and then the next episode he'd be like twenty floors higher with an entirely different party, and it really confused me. Also, I thought that it would have been better to simply remove the second arc, ALFheim Online (ALO), an issue I'll discuss later, and replace it with episodes that connected the primary story and added some crucial details that would have made it more understandable. The conclusion of the first arc was decent with the final boss fight and all, but I felt that it could have been better if the developers put more time into the episodes. Next we move on to ALO. I'm probably in the minority, butI actually liked Alfheim better than the SAO arc, but I believe that Sword Art Online as a whole would have been a much more successful show if it cut out the ALO portion, saved the material for the second season, and expanded further on the SAO section of the anime, which would have given ample time to further develop the characters and fill major plot holes. But the developers decided to combine the two arcs, and we were left with an unfulfilling anime that had the potential to be something much more if done properly.
Sound: 7/10
Although it was nothing spectacular, SAO was able to deliver a decent set of opening and ending themes as well as a nice soundtrack by one of my favorites; Yuki Kajura. The best song would have to be Crossing Field, SAO's first opening, which is definitely a catchy and upbeat tune. The song's vocalist, LiSA, has an awesome voice and really makes the song enjoyable. The voice acting was alright, however it was just too bland.
Art: 8/10
The art is probably the best thing that the show offers. Beings that it takes place in a fantasy RPG world, I expected there to be some vibrant colors, exquisite scenery, and well choreographed battles, and SAO, for the most part, delivered. My main issue was that I felt that the characters had rather basic designs, but it didn't take away too much from the art of the show. 
Characters: 4/10
The characters are, to me, what really held back the anime. Most of them were incredibly dull with hardly any real personality, although some did stand above the rest. 
Kirito- He's the hero! He gets all the girls! He gets the coolest equipment! He saves the day! Everybody loves him! This pretty much sums up who Kirito is as a character. Now don't get me wrong, these traits are not necessarily a bad thing. However in Kirito's case, he's ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS, which makes for an incredibly dull character. He's completely overpowered in SAO, and he simply doesn't lose. I honestly prefer a character who has some flaws, which to me makes them more interesting and relatable as characters, thus making the show more unpredictable and intriguing, since viewers can't be absolutely certain on the character's actions. Kirito can still be a badass at times, but his actions are so predictable. Plus every girl that he so much as glances at instantly falls in love with him, which leads to rather dull relationships. To put it simply, Kirito is boring because he's Just. Too. Perfect. 
Asuna- To be completely honest, I really can't stand Asuna. Mainly because she serves no purpose save for being Kirito's primary love interest who is head over heels for him as well as being a damsel in distress for the entire second half of the anime. She started off alright in the first arc. Asuna was shown to be a powerful fighter and a force to be reckoned with. However later on she transformed into a mere housewife cooking for Kirito and lived to please him. Eventually I started getting extremely annoyed with her actions, and her relationship with Kirito got incredibly dull really fast. And to sum up her performance in the ALFheim, let me just say that she sat in a cage doing nothing practically the entire time. That's literally all she does.
Suguha- In my opinion she's the most complex character SAO has to offer, and I found myself liking her the most. Suguha honestly was the saving grace of ALO for me. I liked her development and how she struggled with her relationship with Kirito, knowing that they weren't really siblings (although still cousins) and how she attempted to overcome her attachment to him by developing a romantic relationship with an individual she met in ALFheim who ironically turned out to be Kirito, thus complicating matters for the girl further. If I recall correctly, she eventually overcame her predicament and came to terms with her cousin's relationship with Asuna. Suguha's struggle was definitely interesting, and like I said, it was essentially the only positive point I found in ALO. 
Yui- She is an AI (artificial intelligence) unit and Kirito and Asuna's ""daughter."" They call her this because Yui views them as parental figures since she had lost her memories when the pair first encountered her, and because the couple was there to assist Yui in her time of need, she referres to them as parents. Even after she regains her memories, she continues to act as the daughter of Kirito and Asuna, thus completing their happy little family. I feel that Yui's sole purpose was to bring the two protagonists closer in their relationship and inspire feelings of emotion from viewers towards the characters from heartwarming interactions between Yui and her parents. Did it succeed? To some degree yes. But I can't help but feel that she was primarily used for filler, and she faded out as the story progressed.
Other- Some of these characters, such as Silica and Lisbeth, actually had potential to be good support characters. However their roles were cut significantly short, and they barely received any screen time. They both only got one or two episodes dedicated to them, and then after that they were completely shoved aside and became nothing more then mindless zombies who blindly stumbled through life with nothing but there desire for Kirito in their minds. I did like Klein, but he gradually became completely overshadowed by Kirito. But seriously, who wouldn't? *sigh* So now I don't even remember what I liked about him in the first place. The villains were absolutely horrendous characters. The first didn't even remember why he trapped hundreds of unsuspecting individuals in a video game *cough* lazy writing *cough* which essentially made everything that transpired during the first half of the anime utterly pointless since the primary antagonist didn't remember anything, which, if he did, could have given viewers an understanding of why SAO was created. The second villain was simply a disgusting pedophile who was excruciatingly annoying and was a terrible antagonist in every way. They're both so pathetic. All other support characters just aren't even worth mentioning.
Enjoyment: 6/10
Even with all of it's flaws, I still found SAO to be somewhat enjoyable. Being a huge gamer, I enjoy when a show explores the possibilities of future gaming, and SAO did a decent job at it. The idea was poorly executed, but it was still enjoyable to see all of the different weapons, locations, and character designs, and some of the battles were interesting to watch.
Overall: 5/10
SAO truly had the potential to be one of the greatest anime I've ever seen, but its hollow characters, glitchy transitions between episodes and poor execution drastically hindered SAO's development. I feel like I'm being rather lenient by giving Sword Art Online a five, but what can I say, SAO was still enjoyable to watch even with it's countless flaws. Well, thanks to everyone who actually spent time to read this unnecessarily long review!",5
"
                Attention: This review contains a few but not really plot-important spoilers.
As you can see, I have only watched about the first arc of Sword Art Online since I felt like it was not worth my time to continue watching it. I didn't watch the anime until the end but I learned one important thing from it: Never trust an anime with a score over 8.0 on MAL when the reviews tell you how bad this anime really is. It’s another prove that scores and ratings can manipulate everything but you get those kinds of things every time when an anime got hyped pretty much for
                  a long time. Another reason why I stopped is that I have heard that the second arc made even die-hard fans facepalm. I have already facepalmed like forever during the first arc, so I guess it must be like ten-times more awful and I am obviously not that much masochistic. 
Story: 4/10
Well, Sword Art Online is about a game called ""Sword Art Online"". It's a MMORPG/""Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game"" which is played with a kind of virtual reality helmet (something like 'Oculus Rift') and makes it able for the player to basically live inside of the game and control the in-game characters with their mind. The world of the game, called ""Aincrad"" has the form of a giant flying castle with floors in it. Each floor has a different level.
Inserts plot twist here: Everything seemed normal at first until suddenly more and more players had realized that they weren't able to log out of the game anymore. Soon as they realized it, it got announced that the only way to get out of the game is to reach the 100th floor and beat every floor-boss. (Short note: They simply have to become lvl 100) The cruel part: When the character dies in-game, the player also dies in real life. The story focuses here on the player and main-lead ""Kirito"", who was also one of the lucky 1000 people who were invited into the closed-beta before the game got officially released.
The story had some really huge potential at some points. But sadly after just a few episodes you will start to forget what the anime's plot was actually about. Trust me, even though you might think while reading the plot description - ""Hey 100 floors with 100 boss-fights. There must be a lot of action in this!?"" - Nope, it's nothing like this. You will only get to see about 4-5 fights (amazingly animated fights - to be honest). The rest of the anime is a bunch of harem, shitty romance and fanservice. Just do not expect a lot of action even though it got put into the action-genre. It's a lie. It's a trick to gain attention. 
Everything feels pretty rushed. The first arc is only about 14 episodes long. Those few episodes are packed with a damn lot plot changes, it would have been a lot better if they had made the first arc actually 24 or 25 episodes long. The time-jumps between the episodes are just extremely big, too.  Where the hell did that little girl even come from and was that marriage even necessary? Everything was just random and seemed to be forced since they kind of showed no emotional development between Asuna and Kirito in the show before. They kissed once and like in the next episode they were married.. It's like they had no other choice at all. 
Overall, the story is as deep as the word potato.
Characters: 3/10
I try to keep this paragraph as short as possible.. even if it seems impossible since the characters actually made the anime so disappointing to me.
The creators/producers did the biggest mistake that an anime could even make: Create a perfect and flawless main lead. In my opinion no person is perfect, so why would you create an anime character who is actually supposed to be perfect? No one with even a bit of an IQ above ""idiotic"" would believe anything of this bullshit.. or feel some kind of sympathy. All the characters are plain, illogical and generic as hell. (I can only say something about Kirito and Asuna since the anime was basically only about those two and everyone else were irrelevant...)
When you throw all kind of generic characteristics you know inside a bottle and mix it together you get Kirito aka the super-overpowered-cutie-badass-harem king. The creators want us to think he's the most perfect one on earth so we have to accept the fact that he's allowed and able to do everything even if it's totally ridiculous. He's the one who gets all the girls, he's the one who is able to save everyone but doesn't really care at all, he's able to do things that other players cannot do, he's the one who you are going to hate so much when you even care a bit about anime characters with personality or background - He's the worst of the worst (Almost as worse as the guy from School Days). The side I mostly hated about him was his ignorant personality and the fact he changed his whole attitude all the time. Kirito is able to change from the badass guy to the whiny shota within two minutes.
There is no harem king without his beautiful generic waifu. This part fills Asuna. I actually had hope in her when I started watching the anime but all my hope got more and more drowned in a huge shark tank. She seemed strong, focused at first. However when her tsundere personality became visible, you could already say at some point that she's just another bog-standard character in this anime world.  Due the huge forced romance she turned from the tsundere into the perfect waifu who started to care more about pleasing Kirito's dick (Chapter 16.5 of the Novel) than becoming independent or even an interesting character. 
After all, the cast of characters is the weakest point of the whole show. It's the reason why the setting became so unrealistic and made me feel like I am not watching an anime which got labeled as ""action"". Also a thing that was the really bad scripted reaction of the players when they found out about what will happen if  they die in the game. After like two days everyone was happy and doing their thing. Sorry but what? How are you able to live there happy and peacefully when you know that a wrong movement, a wrong situation can instantly kill you in real life?
You can expect no character development at all except that the characters turn even more and more annoying. Kirito was still the same guy at the end of the first arc like he was in the first episode. And this is actually the same thing with everyone. You cannot talk about a little bit of character development when the story itself is just plot change after plot change. The anime loses also a lot of potential and on the aspect about the ""supporting cast"". Mostly those characters appear like one time or two times which was definitely not enough when you started to hate the main cast. I believe the whole anime would have been bearable to watch if they had bought more characters in with at least a little bit of personality or humor, just something different than only focusing about Kirito being the harem king and the horrible romance between Kirito and Asuna. I truly enjoyed characters like Klein more than everyone else.
Sound and Animation 9/10:
You can literally see that a lot of money was thrown out of the window while producing this overrated piece of plot-junk. The sounds are amazing, they used high-quality voice actors, the openings/ending-themes kind of catchy and well-produced (but forgettable) + the animation is one of the best nowadays. It's truly an eye/ear-candy. Sadly this doesn't cover up the horrible characters and plot at all. Pretty-looking =/= 10/10 score.
What is left to say?
A lot of people who know me were kind of shocked about the fact that I, a gamer, do hate the anime and everything about it. It's really easy to explain why the whole online-game plot didn't work for me at all: It was bad and had nothing to do with the feeling that you get when you are playing an online-game for real. After like five episodes nothing kept me thinking that the story plays in a game. Everything was only about Kirito and his harem...I can say the whole plot also could have worked in a fantasy or high-school-ish setting. But well.. Since online-gaming has grown a lot in the past few years and a lot of anime-fans have a thing for it, it was really obvious why they chose this kind of setting. It was not even an original idea. Animes like .hack or btoom had the same kind of story plot but did a lot better than Sword Art Online in my opinion.
The setting itself was also bothering me. There were a lot of points that I seriously missed in the game which could make me feel like ""Hey if this game was real, I would totally play it"". It has basically no quests, no different landscapes and don't want me get to the ""beat 100 Levels to win""-thing. Also.. in what kind of game does a beta-player have so much advantage compared to normal players and why are people able to hack the game without getting noticed or banned? Guys like Kirito would have been banned for live-time if the game was just a little bit realistic. Have any of the creators of this anime or the dude who wore the novel even played a MMORPG for once?
Overall: 4/10
Sword Art Online is one of those anime which does not deserve the hype and not even the score of 8,0. I didn't enjoy anything about it except the maybe the high-quality animations and sounds. It's an anime where you have to read the reviews first and cannot trust the rating at all. If you are interested in gaming and believe this anime could be perfect for you: Wrong. It has nothing to do with gaming except the setting ""plays somewhere in an online-game"". When you really want to watch this anime, please no not expect too much or any kind of logic and do not set your hopes that high or you will get disappointed in any possible way. AND PLEASE DO NOT READ CHAPTER 16.5 OF THE NOVEL! JUST DO NOT READ IT!",4

                Ah, SAO. The most popular series of Summer 2012. It is renowned as very popular for being good. However, the anime is not that great.
The story is about 10,000 players being stuck in a Virtual Reality MMO (VRMMO). Kirito, a black swordsman, and Asuna, the ""Flash"" goes on a journey to complete the game with other players.
The anime is really rushed compared to the light novel series. The light novel explains the details and the dialogue is not as short. The fighting sequences are one of the good points of the anime. However, the thing is it is quite rushed as well. The episodes are
                  basically three chapters crammed together. As an avid reader, I believe this anime is not that great. The novels, imo, are much better and I would recommend it over the anime.",6
"
                First, I'll try my best not to include spoilers but be aware that I might accidentally add. By the way, if you find some grammar errors, please ignore and just bear with it because English is not my first language and I'm not good at it.
I would say that this was pretty mainstream. But sometimes I think it's overboard. You could say the story was interesting being trapped in game and when you die you'll die for real. You could also say this was kind of similar to .hack(I just read the synopsis and some recommendation and I think they were.) But the adaptation fails
                  a bit. I mean it feels rushed and they just add side stories so I felt the development was not nice.
Even thought the adaptation of the story was not so good that I was expecting, the art and animation was outstanding(So I rated it 10). I mean, look at those visual effects. And the sounds was good, the OP and ED was good(both 1 and 2). I don't have complaints on the seiyuu since they're doing a good job. Character, the development in anime for the character was not that good for me. I feel like that Kirito and Asuna needs more attention on the past episodes. I mean seeing them both because I feel like Asuna just like Kirito pretty fast(Maybe just for me.)
But, ever since the ALo Arc, I enjoy it more than the first because the first was a bit fast but I think I know now why. I enjoy the series and I feel the anger for Sugou. I think the emotion of the viewers was part of the enjoyment(for me, at least)
Overall 8.
I think you can enjoy this anime too. But some of just think that this was overhyped anime but I don't know because I enjoy this kind of stuff. But this review was just my personal opinion and thoughts about this anime. I maybe biased in some points.",8
"
                Throughout my years on MyAnimeList, I've seen constant reviews of Sword Art Online, claiming it ""terrible"" and ""awful,"" but are these accusations true? Of course not. SAO is the epitome of perfection and anyone who disliked it simply watched it wrong. With this being said, let's get to the review! 
Story (10/10): 
The unorthodox story of Sword Art Online is what makes it so special. The first arc of the story (Sword Art Online) was amazing, but it pales in comparison to the second arc (Alfheim Online). Just when you think it can't get any better, they introduce the world of Alfheim. The first arc
                  revolves around passing 100 different floors, done by beating the final bosses on each level. With each level containing a stronger boss, clearing levels quickly becomes a challenge - that is, it would be if Yui wasn't an invulnerable fairy who can kill any monster with the snap of her tiny repulsive fingers. 
Art (10/10):
A-1 Pictures absolutely delivered with the art and animation of Sword Art Online. Some may say it even blows the animation of Attack on Titan out of the water, which is certainly the case. The art and animation of Sword Art Online is years ahead of its time.
Sound (10/10):
The implausible effect that the music has on you is unheard of. The music is faultless, furthering the immersing experience which SAO offers. It is phenomenal. 
Characters (10/10):
All that needs to be said is Asuna Yuuki. My god...  I would smash th- My apologies. In modest terms she is an exemplary character who makes the show exactly what it is - a masterpiece. The other characters are wonderful, themselves. There are absolutely no flaws when it comes to the characters of Sword Art Online.
Overall (10/10):
Taking all into consideration, in the bigger picture, ""Sword Art Online"" remains a phenomenal accomplishment. When it debuted two years ago, who knew that it would take us to so many dark, difficult, dangerous and fantastically entertaining places? We had no idea what the show would end up doing for us and to us.
Thank you for reading my review!

                This is my first review, so it may not be the best. Okay. Sword Art Online.... I finished watching this thing as it was airing, and I honestly want to punch the producers.(its shown as recent on my list as I just added it). Anyway, I went into the series when it started airing, and I was happy. The idea was a pretty awesome one, getting trapped in an VRMMORPG or a Virtual Reality Massive Multilayer Online Role-Playing Game. (what a mouthful.....)
I would actually love that, but that's not the point. I guess my biggest disappointment is that it could have been so much more.
                  There were many places they could have taken this too, and yet the hit the ground shortly after the series started.
Story - 5/10
Story-wise, I hated everything after the first couple of episodes (1-5), and it slowly got worse as the episodes progressed, and if it was only S1, this would have got a 7.5, not 6 on my list. 
Why?
Well for one, there is no sense of time. By episode 3, two years have past....... SO what happened in those two years? Did they wander around like lost sheep playing the game? Did something bad happen. Honestly, tell me, what happened in those 2 years?
Then we have the pacing. This is kinda non-existent. Let's look at one of the things it was ""praised"" for, it's romance. Not that I hate romance, in fact that cold have been one of the series most interesting parts, and I generally enjoy it in ""RomComs"" (Romance & Comedy). So, mind telling me how in 1 or 2 episodes, Asuna literally fell head over heels for this guy named Kirito? Where was the development between the two. There was, sadly to say, little. It happened so fast... that we basally don't know what happened.
Then she wants to marry this guy...... You have gotta be kidding me. It funny, as they say this was one of the best points of SAO. This all happens in one episode.
Step away from the romance, season 1 had decent pacing at most, put they probably should have stopped it right there. They just put pointless things. 
Could we learn about the world? No.
Could we learn about the guilds? No.
Could we learn a bit more about other characters who aren’t our main protagonists? No.
Just watch one guy, running around this fantasy world, hooking up with every girl he meets, and who all for some reason fall in love with him, and then only stay for one episode at most, before disappearing. And then in season 2, it just gets rid of most of them. So, I must ask, what was the point? What addition were they meant to add to the story? They add one interesting male character, but he is quickly swept away, to come back later for another episode, and then he disappears again.
So story wise, don't expect anything but a mediocre generic story, unless that's your thing. I wonder if any body even bothers reviewing the script of each episode. It has so many plot holes, don't even other to count them.
Art : 8/10
A bit more work could have been done on it, but overall, I was fairly happy with it. Fluid animation, good art work. Some of the skill effects were generic, but still looked nice.
Sound : 8/10
Once again, I have no problems with the sound. It was a nice soundtrack, and the opening for season 1 was pretty nice.
Characters : 3/10
Possibly the most disappointing aspect of the whole show. I hate Kirito. There are just so many problems with him, and his character is so badly created.
-He too OP. WOW! He has some special powers that easily take down a boss that's well um.... beating them around for a bit. I mean seriously, every time a challenge comes by, he jumps over it by gaining some mysterious powers. And he takes this boss down with one shot. No body is going to be that lucky.
-SPOILER-
-No character development. He doesn’t really change until he leaves the game at the end of season 1. And then he stays the same for season 2. So there is a little bit of development.
-SPOILER-
Then we have the other ones. Asuna starts off great, and I had high hopes for her. BUT then she meets Kirito, and all this slowly disappears. Another reason why I hate him. His character dragged down everyone else, and she becomes a ""maiden in distress"", not even appearing in the second season where she is imprisoned. They, for the most part shelve her.
Yui is an example of decent character development, I actually liked her character through out the whole series. She slowly develops a felling of happiness as Asuna's and Kirito's adopted child. This was good, and the path to getting to that point was well paced. I wish the same could be said for the rest of them.
And then there is his sister, who is one of the main characters in season 2, when they are in Alfheim Online. While she was a bit annoying, I had no problems with her.
I won't bother naming the rest, as they are truly supporting characters. They appear for an episode or two, and then disappear. But I would be more interested to know what happened to
-Klein
-Heathcliff
-Silica
-Lizibeth
-Sachi(spoiler - she's there for one episode, then she dies)
These people were  there and then shelved. And I liked every one of them better then Kirito, buy seriously, what happened to them?
Final Verdict:
Story : 5/10
Art : 8/10
Sound :8/10
Character : 3/10
Enjoyment : 5/10
Final Score : 5.8/10 (that’s an average based on the above scores.)
Wow, you know they say when your unhappy about something, get it all out by writing it. This certainly helped. Sword Art Online could have been so much better, and yet they dug themselves into the ground. You want to know what I wanted from SAO, then check out Log Horizon. It's everything SAO could have and should have been, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It's got me more interested in 3 episodes about it then SAO did in all its 25 episodes.
So if you have time to waste, or you want to see how an anime in this genre can stuff it self up, the watch it. Other wise, you should cross this off your list.",5

                Sword Art Online runs under the premise almost out of a Saw film: A master programmer of an MMORPG has entrapped everyone in the game and the only way to escape is to fight your way through a series of dungeons in order to fight the final boss. Players in the real world lay in a vegetative state and will be killed instantly should anyone try to remove the virtual reality unit they are tied too. And somehow an incredible amount of time passes and no one has been able to figure out a solution to this. Sword Art Online has all the setting of
                  a potential heart racing thriller but doesn't seem to care about that.
The writing is so mismatched in this series that it almost feels like there are two different camps of writers on working, one writing team that seems more interested in making a series about a regular MMO and regular people that play them and a another camp that wants to make a regular fantasy series with a mix of science-fiction elements. Either one of these would be fine for a show, where it not for the fact that the series had set it self up to be an action thriller with people's lives hanging in the balance. It gets to the point it seems like the staff wants to be doing either one of these shows but got stuck doing an adaptation of existing material by the studio.
Each episode feels as disconnected as the next with little overarching connection to it. What manages to save it from really feeling like there are really two different teams of writers trying to make the show something completely different, is the cast of uninteresting characters. For being in such a stressful and dangerous situations the characters all seem strangely calm about this. There doesn't seem to be anxiety, a desire to race to the finish and get back to reality sooner or even survive. Everyone seems to carry on as normal as if they're just regular Players playing a regular game, when you expect mass races to the finish, team ups or anything more sensible. 
Even the main character seems to not give any kind of care about this. Seeing a bunch of character behave like everything is normal with not even the slightest inclination that all is not well just robs this series of any peril. And and there's no indication that these are troubled people who'd rather live out their world in virtual reality, so there's no justification of the strange amount of calm, nor is it a series told through flashbacks that will eventually return to the set-up. It's the same kind of problem I had with Toyko Magnitude 8.0 which also found a group of characters in a very stressful and life threatening situation but didn't show any signs of it. The series really relies on you suspending your disbelief.
The animation quality is pretty good it's pretty standard animation fare but I hardly think it's as quality as many say it is but it's certainly not bad either.  The art and character designs look quite interesting and pretty usual anime fare.  The art direction is also well crafted with many great matte paintings to make up the virtual world.
I never thought I'd see the day when I actually found a musical score by Yuki Kajiura so boring that I have zero interest in even sampling the soundtrack down the road. This has to be one of Kajiura's least interesting scores since The Garden of Sinners film series but even those had some strong theme songs behind them, this has nothing! For being a more symphonic score outside of Kajiura's usual small musician ensemble she fails so terribly at catching any of her stylistic charm seen with past scores nor any sense of unique flair or adventure that comes with a different direction than what she normally does. It's an even less interesting rendition of her work on Fate/Zero and not a single solitary piece stands out to make it worth mentioning. I've been a fan of Kajiura for many years and I've never been let down so hard before.
This series is one of these most overrated series of the past year with very little that makes it worth a good watch. The series has a lot of action but very little substance to back it up and even the action isn't that fun because there's no thrill or danger to it because the characters simply don't give a shit.",2
"
                After a series of disappointments which nearly drive me to quit watching anime, Sword Art Online succeeded to stop me from doing so. 
The concept is superb, and well thought. However, I have to admit that there are several flaws with the flow of the story. The series itself seems consist of several independent story instead of one, while in the same time shows that the story flow as one. I hardly seen any character developments for Kirito and Asuna until episodes 15 onwards. It would be great if Kirito's character developed as the story goes on. Following this, I rated the story as 8
                  out of 10. 
The art and sound are well made. You cant hope for more after you watched the anime. The art and sound are what made the anime so dreamy-like, which best portrayed the concept of fantasy virtual world. 
Although the series episode 1 - 14 made from several independent stories, it still gives high enjoyment rate, which many anime failed to do. The story may seems cliche, but the way of delivery is done superbly where it can push my boring meter to 0.
In overall, I rate the anime as 9/10. In short, the anime shows great potential and set an example on what anime should be instead of focusing on heavy ecchi/fan service criteria. The only things that disappoint me is the character development, which was weak until episode 15. In conclusion, this anime is definitely worth to be watched.",9
"
                If you've seen the trailer for SAO then you would see how awesome it looks and the virtual reality mmorpg idea just seems amazing and add on the plot of a death game, even better.
I can say for the majority of people that what they expected of SAO, was not what they got.  To clear all 100 floors and free the players trapped in the game, sounds magnificent as you expect that's what it actually is, but it's not.  
SAO's story has so much potential, but it turned out to be a utter let down.  
Why you may ask?
What people want to
                  see is clearing this death game with wonderful boss battles and how players will struggle in a game of life or death to be free.
What people got was one of the worst dramas with a terrible storyline that will make people rethink if they are actually watching SAO.
It's not about how people trapped in a game clearing it to be free and face the hardships of risking their life.  
But one 16 year old boy who scores all the girls because hes so wonderful and strong and kind because of terrible plot.  
Characters : terrible
Story : terrible
Soundtrack : Amazing
I actually read the light novels of SAO as well, and despite how terrible the story was for the anime, it's surprisingly an great light novel, just that it was poorly adapted.",2
"
                When I first saw SAO, I was expecting a good story, but it was very mundane. In fact, the story's main focus was on the characters themselves. This could be good, but:
Kirito: the solemn type who wears black and wields a massive ass sword, he is completely devoid of personality aside from the desire to keep things from raping his girlfriend. Despite spending his days playing video games, he receives dozens of requests from bitches for his D.
Asuna: Kirito's babe, Asuna, started out as a generic tsundere, but her personality faded as the story progressed, living for no apparent reason other than to fuck Kirito.
Klein:
                  With only about ten minutes of screen time throughout the series, he serves only as comic relief.
Kirigaya is Kirito's sister, and she wants to suck his cock. But, hey, who cares?",2
"
                Just as a heads up this is going to be my first review bear with grammar, thank you.
Set in the near future. Virtual reality could very be at its peak because of an Invention called the Nerve Gear, which allows the user to play in a virtual reality as if it’s real life. A MMORGP called Sword Art Online (S.A.O for short) is released as thousands of people rush out to obtain a copy of this limited game, “Kazoto Kirigaya” or “Kirito” is about to log on for the first time sense his experience in beta.  
Story 6
Keeping in mind I haven’t read the
                  novels yet!
The entire story leaves a feeling of being rushed, countless times I felt like I was missing something significant, or that it wasn’t elaborated on enough. You couldn’t walk move more than ten feet without falling into another plot hole. It seemed to focus mostly on the action oriented parts of the story leave a bunch of grey area they could have easily expanded on. It’s doesn’t reach coherent timeline till a good part in about episode eight or ten. Before this it would just jump around to significant events that I could easily bet shaped Kirito’s character in the novels. 
Character 6
The main the protagonist Kirito and his companion Asuna fill cliché character types with Kirito being the unlikely hero and Asuna being the overall sex appeal. Asuna is used mostly for fan service, which can easily stopped any feelings of being a hero. A romance is apparent between this two but a lot of it feels unnatural and fake. The main problem I had was with the side characters, barely any time is spent on them and most of them don't really have a purpose after their first appearance. Even if they do, you can’t remember their names or why their presence is significant.
Animation / Sound 10 
Luckily the artistic and musical aspects of Sword Art Online make for the other aspects. The impacting action scenes did themselves justice. Character design is beautiful in every way possible. The noticeable background in some of the scenes portrays a vivid, limitless sky, which befits the floating island setting. The sound track from the anime is memorable. Although it would've been better to switch around its soundtracks, the synchronization of music with the art worked out efficiently. Both the Openings and Endings are beautifully done by the artist; Yuki Kajiura and the voice acting surprisingly fits the character's traits.
Enjoyment 8
I will admit I enjoyed Sword Art Online a lot despite its flaws. The idea of MMORPG setting has nostalgia. Sword Art Online provides decent amount of entertainment if you watch without expecting a serious story. If you walk in expecting one you'll become too derailed and take everything too literally.
Overall 9
Overall Sword Art Online provides decent amount of entertainment  if you can look past its major flaws. It’s one of my top five.

"
                First of all, I want to say that if you’re an unconditional hater of Sword Art Online, don’t read further please. I noticed that there are an important number of low rating reviews for this anime, so I think having another point of view would be great. Anyway don’t get wrong, I’m not writing this review to make the praise of SAO, I just want to share my feelings. Constructive criticisms are always welcome.
Sword Art Online is surely the anime which divides the most this year. But I think one thing brings people together in agreement, this anime had an amazing potential. Only by
                  seeing the first two episodes you’ll see it. The plot is well introduced and really interesting. Having the consciousness trapped in a perfectly modeled virtual game, and with only one possibility to escape from that: finish the game, is quite captivating.
 Then come the development of the story, when Sword Art Online definitively lost a part of the viewer. Why? To me, because some people didn’t expect what the producers wanted to describe in the show: the feelings. Love, fear of death, friendship, treason…. Yeah this show has a considerable part of describing feelings by scarificing some action scenes. And I don’t think everybody was disappointed by that. Anyway, if you’re going to watch this anime, have that in mind: you won’t watch a show full of action, fighting scenes and hard trainings.
Let’s talk about the action now, in one word: sloppy. Come on, fighting scenes against bosses, apart from episode 2, are like two minutes long, what’s that? We just begin to appreciate the fight and it finish hurriedly. The fight with the suspense the most appreciable exactly takes 1min15, and it has at least 20sec of thiking of the protagonist. This isn’t the strong part of the anime, you’ll understand it. As the fights, the story is a little rushed. Kirito sometimes up 10 levels between two episodes, it personally didn’t disappoint me, but I can understand that it can do, so it’s important to say it.
 Fortunately, the romance catches up the anime in extremis, but not everyone agree with me I think, let’s develop for people that plan to watch it. Yeah it has 5 ‘loving’ story in the 25 episodes (even if for me 2 of them are more a male-girl friendship), but only one is reciprocal. And it isn’t a harem or something like. It seems to be a lot, but it really deserves the anime, and his purpose. Once again, it’s possible that you disagree with me, but I just share what I think. 
So if we’re talking about relationship, let’s have a look at the characters. The protagonist, named Kirito in the game, is firstly a reclusive person, who prefer stand and play alone. What is really great is that we will see how, in facing challenges and risking his life, he will grow up in mind. Firstly thinking that he is overpowered and super-skilled, he will become disillusioned, and will see that he is nothing but somebody fighting for his life, like everybody in the game. The meeting with Asuna will really change him. Asuna is another main character, a girl that wants to escape the faster possible this world. Why she is well made? Surely because she make the dream of any MMO players come true. A girl playing a massive multiplayer game, beautiful, and really skilled. 
I can’t really describe others characters since it will have more spoils than information. Moreover, some characters only appear in one episodes, but it once again deserve the anime, more precisely the setting here. We’re in a game, so it’s quite normal to meet somebody one day, and never see him again.
For the art & sound, it was pretty damn epic. Every battle made me get the chills due to the music. The music matched every scene. It was perfect. Now I'm no music expert, but if an average person like me can get hooked onto music that I usually dont listen to, it must be pretty good.
In summary, Sword Art online is not as bad as a lot of reviewers say. It just follows its own path, surely different from what would be great to do for them. I’m aware that this show has a considerable number of lacks, but what you should ask to yourself is: Am I watching shows for all the work put in it, or just to spend a nice time? To me, the enjoyment is the more important thing to rate a show. Once again, don’t be outraged, it’s just my point of view.

                -Story
The basic premise of Sword Art Online is that players are stuck in an MMORPG game with no way of logging out until someone completes the game by clearing all the levels. The catch is that if you die in the game, you die in real life.
The premise is great, it's very interesting, but the way the story is delivered seems quite strange. The first few episodes can be a bit confusing as there are a lot of time jumps without any type of warning or explanations. The overall goal of trying to survive and escape the death game is interesting. However, the story is
                  derailed by several filler stories that bring little light to the game world and forcibly progress an underdeveloped romance.
Although the first half of the season had an interesting enough driving force as the plot, the second half's story seems much more frivolous. The driving force behind the second story arc seems incredibly weak but one of the problems is that the story takes itself so seriously. It becomes incredibly difficult to relate to the characters and the story when they're acting like they're trying to decide the fate of the world rather than just playing a game.
-Art
There's no complaints on this front as the visuals are beautifully done and especially stand out during the excellent combat sequences. The boss fights feel epic and grand because the art really helps to convey the size and power of these monsters.
-Sound
The soundtrack is solid without a doubt. The orchestra/choir songs work to convey an epic feeling to fights and there are also other pieces during emotional scenes that work well. In my opinion, there really weren't any songs that stood out but the soundtrack complements the show well as a whole.
-Character
This is, in my opinion, easily the weakest part of Sword Art Online. The character development reaches levels far below mediocre and is downright horrible.
Kiritio - This is the main character but there really isn't anything that we really get to know about him except that he's an awesome gamer that attracts every single girl. 
Asuna - The main female protagonist, she starts off with a huge bang and seems to be set to become a very strong character but completely disappears for several episodes before returning to become completely dependent on Kirito. An absolute waste of a potentially great character.
Kirito's Girls - This is probably one of the worst parts in the anime. Throughout the series, Kiritio basically amasses a harem of girls who all inexplicably fall for him. They get almost no character development at all and it's utterly ridiculous how they all fall in love with him immediately. The character development here wasn't just bad, it was so nonsensical that it just pulled me out of the scenes to facepalm.
Yui - Feels like a character just shoehorned in to make emotional scenes. Doesn't really work and seems completely forced.
-Enjoyment
Despite all my complaints, I never was bored during Sword Art Online. The character development and 2nd story arc frustrated and annoyed me. But the visuals and action scenes were excellent and the intriguing premise wasn't completely put to waste. The 2nd half of the season also takes massive dives from the already weak character and story development.
If you can overlook the ridiculous character development, then I think it'll be very easy to enjoy this story, but it becomes a very frustrating aspect. However, the show is still decently enjoyable to watch once.
-Overall
It's by no means horrible, but there are some really glaring flaws that make this show mediocre at best.",5

                Through what I have seen of this anime - what has been released when I post this - it's either the best, or one of the best animes I have seen. The storyline I believe is great, and it deserves to be continued in another season. The ONLY downfall I saw in it was that it was a bit short on either side of the 2 seasons in the one. It's a bit confusing if I put it that way, let's just say, the continuation of the storyline. But the transition into the next storyline was amazing, and I just love this anime. That's just
                  my personal opinion. Try it, and depending on your tastes, I'm sure most people would love it as much as I did.",10

                Alright, I just finished watching the entire series. I know there are a lot of mixed reviews concerning this particular anime. However, I actually enjoyed the series quite of bit. Granted, I too had some issues, so my assessment is not completely bias. 
Story: 7/10
I have never actually watched any anime where the bulk of the story takes place in a virtual world. However, the premise of this particular show was very intriguing. Basically imagine that your trapped in an MMO and the only way out is to beat the game. However, if you die in the game you die in the real world, which
                  definitely raises the stacks considerably. The only way to win is to clear one hundred levels of a giant floating castle. Sounds pretty awesome, right? Well unfortunately, the show doesn't actually go through each level, but instead skips entire levels and sections between episodes. 
Characters: 7/10
Sadly, the show itself had great potential but fell short in proper pace and characterization. The pace of this show is really off, especially the first half. The second half does a considerably better job with the overall pace. However, the first half of the show is undeniably the most interesting, but hops around and skips large amounts of time. While the second half is a forced attempt to keep the show alive with a new virtual environment. As for the characters, most characters excluding the main characters, have almost no additional screen time beyond one episode. These supporting characters are very interesting, but there isn't any time dedicated to fleshing them out or developing them at all. However, the relationship developed between Kirito and Asuna is probably one of the most pleasing aspects of this show. These two characters really and truly develop real feelings for one another. Yet, not everyone is a hopeless romantic, so this could be a hit or a miss depending on who's watching. 
Art and Sound: 9/10
The animation in my opinion is top-notch. The characters flow with smooth fluidity and the timing is excellent, especially during the action sequences. There isn't any cheesy delay between one attack or another, but consist flow of action instead. The soundtrack is pretty good, and blends well with the setting and situation. It seamlessly blends right into the background. The animation and soundtrack are definitely the saving grace of this show. I genuinely enjoyed watching the series for those two things.
As I am writing this, I find it hard to give this anime an awesome review. Sword Art Online made some obvious mistakes that could have made the series amazing. However, I would say it accomplished what it set out to do, and that was to be enjoyable. Overall, Sword Art Online is a good watch and generally enjoyable.",7
"
                Sword Art Online is a great example of an anime that had the potential to be great with a concept that has been done before but with a possible twist, but why Sword Art Online fails is not because of the animation (Obviously) or the overall Story but in the way the show unfolds the story. I'll explain.
Starting with story, it's fairly simple. The main and, side characters are thrust into a game world where they cannot log out and if they die in the game they will die in reality. See Fairly simple concept and nothing is wrong with this concept, what I meant
                  when I said the problem was how to story unfolded was because of the characters and the pacing in which this story was told. The show has many parts where you feel unfulfilled such as when the story introduces us with filler in the first couple episodes I immediately feel as though they are trying to say ""Are you enjoying the show? I hope so because I have a surprise for you...IT'S FILLER."" The only reason the filler was there was to show that the main character Kirito get's his new weapons or meet some useless characters that in no way enhance or add to the plot. Actually you don't see any of the characters from those episodes ever again. Now the filler isn't also the problem. On the note of Kirito the story makes him literally invincible just for the sake of being the character that will always save the day, so there is nothing to relate to and no reason for use to get attached to this character or the story that follows. There is also the issue of pacing. The Pacing is absolutely atrocious. Now that's not to say I didn't kind of enjoy the first half of the series. The problem is how I felt like they rushed the entire first half of the series just to continue to rush the second half. At times they would just slow down and dedicate 2-3 episodes on character development where the characters don't develop. You kind of get the gist of what I'm trying to say here.
Characters are practically bland and there is really nothing good to say about these characters. None of these characters really develop. Let's start with the main character Kirito. Kirito is one of the most cardboard characters I have seen in Anime in a while. From the very start Kirito was overpowered as I said just for the sake of being overpowered so that he can be the one to save the day. He never really develops as a character, when you feel as though he might develop in an episode the very next one he returns to the bland cardboard character he was to begin with. Same thing with Asuna and most of the other characters in the show. 
One thing this show does right though is the art and music. The art is absolutely beautiful and the action scenes look amazing. Combine these beautiful, and well animated action scenes with great music which was the only memorable thing that came from this show made the show worth pushing through. 
Overall I feel like there is too much wrong with this show to actually have enjoyed a lot of it. It was a hassle for me to personally watch through this series. Although you might not agree I feel as though although the music, and the art was great nothing else was executed very well. So if you are just looking for something to just watch in your free time I'm sure you could find something else but if you insist watch this and see for yourself. There isn't much to keep you engrossed in the story or the characters but the show is worth watching for the animating and music.",4
"
                When just a game becomes real life and the only way to escape is victory over the seemingly impossible, what do you do? Panic or fight for your life. This is where the strong thrive and take on the challenge like our main protagonist here Kirito, who I thought was amazing. 
What can I say, this anime is awesome!! From the amazing battles, to the beautiful love between Kirito and Asuna, to the stunning visuals throughout the series and even the first opening…I loved it all. So much so that I found myself rooting for Kirito as he fought like I was in the game
                  with him myself.  His bravery and mastery of skills really make him one of the best heroes in all of anime. I mean no matter what he always came through, sometimes even by himself like when he took down the level 74 boss in one of the episodes, just awe inspiring.
Oh and like I said before, his relationship with Asuna was just beautiful, we see so much character development with these too as besides his sister, they are the only main characters which is I personally prefer in this type of dramatic romance anime. The way they just grew together and lived off each other was so wonderful and it felt genuine even if this is fiction.
Overall I would call this anime a masterpiece and it is deserving of a 10 despite some flaws obviously. The good here outweighs the controversial so much and just off coolness alone this deserves a 10. I am very critical when it comes to grading anime so giving this a 10 is really a big deal. To anyone questioning whether or not to watch Sword Art Online, I’ll just tell you that if you’re a true anime fan then you can possibly pass on this show!",10
"
                After watching the whole series of Sword Art Online. This is the one anime that kept me watching. Most animes I've ever come across, I would get heavily distracted and forget about the series completely. But this one kept me watching and I hated the wait for a new episodes.
Kirito and Asuna were very enjoyable characters. They both went through so many struggles though their struggles is what made them stronger. I fail to see why people call them Mary-sues or Gary-stus, yes while Kirito does always come up with a solution for a plan. He has his flaws too.
He doesn't always have everything his
                  way. And neither does Asuna.
But that's soley my opinion. This anime isn't too bad and most animes would have a lot of fan service that draws away attention from the series. So you gotta give this series an A for this.
Not saying that there isn't fan service or ecchi in this anime. Considering a lot of the girls are in love with Kirito; but hey. What do you expect? Lot of other anime have that and people don't say much on them. The virtual world death game was genius; even though this story does remind me of .hack with the MMORPGS. I've enjoyed SAO more.
The animation was great, the music was awesome, YUKI KAJIURA. Favorite artist to compose music; so that's enough for me.
But yeah, I give SAO an 8, because I do believe they should have played with the SAO arc a little more before going into the FAIRY ARC. My only complaint is I feel they have rushed it to get the series  done.  SAO should have had its own season. Not just be split into two arcs. But the way they ended it was awesome.",10
"
                This may contain very minor spoilers for the romance aspect of the show. 
Oh, dear, where to start. 
Sword Art Online is one of those series that explodes in popularity and if you haven't seen or heard  of it you're living under a rock, so to speak. Going into this series I was excited and apprehensive at the same time. ""What if it really is amazing?"" as the many fanboys like to often remind me. But then I thought ""It's probably most likely overrated and not as terrible as the haters make out to be"".
How wrong I was.
I have many, many problems with this
                  series ,but the major one is the main character. The ever popular Kirito. Kirito has no personality whatsoever, he's a blank slate for the viewer to insert themselves in a perfect example of a Gary Stu. He has no flaws, every female wants him and all the guys hate him or think he's the second coming of Christ. My second problem with the series is one that I thought wouldn't be that big of a plot point considering the synopsis, is that of the romance. 
If I had to describe the romance in SAO in one word,it would be: cringeworthy. But before discussing the awful romance I have to talk about the main female protagonist: Asuna. Now, I had high hopes for Asune I was hoping for a strong female protagonist, but what I got was a Mary Sue. 
*Sigh*
Asuna starts out with potential as a person who can take care of herself, but no low and behold she ends up having to rely on a man to do everything. Now back to the romance. The romance was probably the worst I've seen in anime so far, as the show started to focus on it quite it bit. It was just so rushed in how Kirito fell in love with sandwic- I mean Asuna. They even get married, which left me with the feeling that I'd missed a part of the story where their romance is fleshed out, but no I did not miss out on anything, the romance was rushed and cringeworthy. The couple had absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. 
Now onto the story.
*Sigh*
The story, like the romance was equally rushed. In the first couple of episodes this is very notably as there are quite a few times skips for no reason. Oh, and the show fails the whole suspense thing. Sure, people are in danger and die, but it doesn't feel like it should. Kirito is protected by plot armour and even when he is in danger he just pulls a deus ex machina out of his arse and survives. It's moments like this that take away any semblance of ""suspense"" the show has. As for the the controversial second arc of the show, I haven't got much to say other than it was just as bad as the first. The only thing I can say about it is that Kirito's sister Suguha was a character that I thought had potential but in the and was wasted and she was pushed aside to make way for the all important Kirito. And with that it concludes my review. As I am writing this know I am somewhat melancholic, this show could have been amazing, showing the effects of what death can have on a person and the aspects of love in a virtual world, but ultimately the show fell flat on it's metaphorical face. 
Ultimately,I cannot recommend this show to anyone, unless you want to live out a teenaged male power fantasy than go ahead and watch it. And if not, go watch something else you most likely won't like this.
Thanks for taking the time to read the review it was my first so I hope you found it helpful.",3

                Intro:
Sword Art Online is the smartest anime I've seen. Literally, the plot is so bad that it's good. It's probably one of the most cliche anime which is also nice. It's great to bring some unoriginality into the industry with a very intricate and concise plot. Our main character is plunged into a virutal fantasy of MMORPGs where he meets 10,000 other players where they are trapped together. He fights and makes companions along his way to clearing the game.
Story: error/10
Totally unique story. Guy meets the most idealistic girl and they end together. Oh, he also gets his own harem. The writing of this show
                  is only good if you're one of those people who like to switch their brains off and ignore major inconsistencies and watch for entertainment rather than deducing and pointing out flaws. Like why is it even called Sword Art Online when they have Alfheim and Gun Gale afterwards????
Art: 10/10
Animation is pretty dope for action scenes and fan-service. Not complaining. 
Sound and Music: 10/10
Badass. Heck the opening songs aren't even half-bad compared to other animes.
Character: 10/10
Every characters gets a massive amount of character development. Kirito goes from a loser playing video games to getting a rich girl. Asuna goes from a loser rich girl to waifu status. Sinon goes from a loser to a badass sniper... etc.
Overall 9/10
I recommend to anyone 1+ years old.",9

                I personally really enjoyed this anime! This review is not to change your mind on whether you hate it or love it. It is to give MY overall opinion on it, so that is what I will do. 
Story- Personally, coming from a gamer's stand point, I enjoyed the story very much. Being able to play a virtual reality game, being able to smell, touch, hear, and see things that you normally would not be able to in real life is just amazing! That is what really gets the story going for me. Then they bring in a character that knows almost everything there is
                  to know about this game, with special abilities and what not. SAO never gets too boring, well, to me, I never got bored once! I was always on my toes or the edge of my bed, waiting for the next thing to happen. Also, I myself, am not a very emotional person so since this anime had me laugh, cry, smile and feel other emotions, then that is also another plus. Some people will say that there was no story or that is was super boring, but that is there opinion! 
Art- The art in this anime is some of the best I have ever seen! Granted I have no seen hundreds of anime like a lot of other people, but I have seen a good bunch, and this anime is at the top of my list for art. The scenery is beautifully done, especially in those moments that it plays a big part. It never lets you down, like some anime's do when the scene is big, but the art is so crappy you just don't feel what you need to feel or what the creators are trying to make you feel. To be honest, the scenery made me want to smile and cry sometimes too because it adds that much of an effect on your emotions. 
Sound- This was my weakest caption. The sound and music does also have a big effect on some people but not on me. Still though, SAO excels in this category as well! The music does help add emotion to Asuna's and Kirito's scenes when it is needed. That is all I have to say about the sound.
Characters: So I, personally, love all the characters in this anime with the exception of Kirito-kun's sister Suguha(only because of the relationship is tries to have with Kirito-kun!). The two best characters, of course, are Kirito-kun and Asuna; Mainly because these two are the main characters. In the beginning Kirito-kun already had a lot of knowledge of SAO because he was a beta tester. Then after defeating the first battle, he was pushed into a corner because of his sword fighting skills and knowledge of the game. So the effect of that was he made a new term for himself, A beater, a cheater and a beta tester. To defeat the first boss, some players gathered together in groups of 5 to fight together to kill it. Kirito-kun was never very friendly with any of the other players, mostly because he was determined on finishing the game(if you don't finish the game, you stay there forever). So he sees this one girl, sitting all alone, and goes over to her to group up. Her player name and real life name is Asuna. Asuna, in the first boss battle, shows some kick-ass fighting skills like Kirito-kun, but after that he tells her to join a guild with people she trust. Later on in the next episodes we see her again, but now she is a super-good fighting chick! She is my favorite character out of the entire show, tied with Kirito-kun of course! The two slowly develop feelings for each other, and you feel like you can feel what they feel! They are definitely on my top 5 anime couples! Maybe even number one:)
Enjoyment: My shortest category. I completely loved this show. If i tried to go into detail here I would be typing a book, so let me just say, this show never gets boring! Watch it! 
Overall: Overall, this show is excellent. I will re-watch when I get a chance, and finish some other animes that I am currently watching. I finished this anime in a matter of 2 days(little excessive) but it was totally worth it. It is one of those animes that leaves an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach. Do I recommend this anime?...HECK YES!",8

                There are many sources from which anime spring. Though many are new series with original story lines and characters, others are adaptations of other media. Common sources include manga, movies, novels (light and otherwise), visual novels, games and even other anime. Some adaptations prove superior to their source material, others are shadows hinting at what could have been, and still others twist original story lines and characters into something that, through the producers' attempts to draw in viewers, has become more of a perversion of the original work than a mere adaptation. 
Sword Art Online is one such adaptation, though it doesn't quite fit into
                  any of the types I described above. 
A quick note: this review does contain a few mild spoilers, though not as many as some reviews for SAO that I've read. 
An introduction to the plot, for anyone that hasn't either read the novels or begun watching the anime: 
In the near future, technology has advanced to the point where new games are played through total immersion in virtual worlds created and maintained by the games' servers. Sword Art Online is the newest and by far the most advanced game of this new genre. For the grand opening of the game, roughly 10,000 players log in and create their characters. The game director appears during the commencement ceremony and announces that the players are unable to log out of the game and additionally will die in the real world if their characters die in-game. The only way to escape from the game is to clear all 100 levels of the game's dungeon. 
As a premise, SAO's story is at the very least intriguing and promising. The ""trapped in a game"" genre has been done before, but not extensively. The first episode of the anime plays out excellently; beginning the entire series with the problem at hand is an fantastic way to hook viewers. The second episode then follows through on the high expectations set by its precedent. Then the series begins to lose this initial focus. 
I would like to point out that I am a huge fan of the original Sword Art Online novels, the source material from which the anime is drawn. Their layout is conducted in a somewhat different manner from the anime. The first novel is the Aincrad arc. The second novel is a series of side-stories that occur during the Aincrad arc. The third and fourth novels are the ALFheim Online arc. Though there are more novels, the anime covers the events of these first four. 
I can only guess at the motivations of the producers at how they altered the structure in which SAO is presented. Perhaps they believed that sticking to the novel layout would lose viewers, perhaps they simply wanted to attract additional attention. Regardless of the reasons, the producers decided to mesh novels one and two together. This means a presentation of all the events in the Aincrad arc at once, rather than first solving the main plot and then going back for the side stories. As a production technique, this is perfectly understandable in theory, but in application it probably would have been better if the producers had instead cut out novel two altogether. 
At its core, SAO is a romance story and an adventure story. It is NOT a harem. The two main characters are Kirito and Asuna, and it is inevitably between these two that the romance occurs. SAO novel one, in addition to plowing its way through the main plot line of the Aincrad arc, oversaw the beginning of and development of the relationship between Kirito and Asuna. SAO novel two added new characters for each of its side-stories in order to make them more interesting. Unfortunately, in each of these side-stories, the new character around which the subplot revolves is female. 
This is the first area where the anime fails to match up to the novels. By integrating the side-stories with the main plot, the anime adopted a harem feel. Kirito begins to develop friendships with various girls (who inevitably think he's the greatest thing that ever existed) before Asuna is fleshed out as a character. As a result, Asuna feels more like the ""harem candidate that wins"" than the main heroine, at least for a while. 
One of the things that bothers me the most in many review I read are terms such as ""Mary-Sue,"" ""Gary-Stu,"" and (the worst of the lot) ""Deus Ex Machina."" I sincerely believe that over time, the true and original meaning and intent behind these terms has been twisted and abused to the point where every strong male character is a Gary-Stu, every strong female character is a Mary-Sue, and every plot device that wasn't absolutely what the viewer expected or was desiring becomes a Deus Ex Machina. I've lost count of the number of times I've had to argue why events in anime were not, in fact, poorly contrived and executed Deus Ex Machina and how just because a viewer doesn't either like or expect something that happens doesn't mean it's stupid. 
That being said, it is worth pointing out that Kirito is practically a Gary-Stu. He has zero flaws. He has prior knowledge of the game, he's one of the best players, he's the object of attraction for most of the girls in the series, he always wins (at least when the fight is fair), he's given privileges and abilities that other players don't have, and he defies the logic of the game engine. These types of characters rarely bother me, and I respect and enjoy the way they are utilized. But if a viewer is looking for a protagonist with major flaws, or if a viewer desires the type of character that starts out weak but becomes high-invincible by the end, then SAO probably isn't a good match for that viewer. 
Additionally, the Aincrad arc does in fact throw in one of the most annoying Deus Ex Machina events I've ever seen. It would have been so easy for the producers to put in 10-20 seconds of dialogue explaining this event away and so prevent its classification as an obnoxious magical plot-solver, but unfortunately, they don't. I've created my own justification for it and so can mentally dismiss it as a simple lack of clarity in the writing, but it's still there, and it's still bound to annoy viewers. 
The second area where the anime doesn't match up to the novels (in my opinion) is the fan service. Make no mistake, it was present in the novels. But the anime (as most do) takes it a little too far. This is likely a byproduct of the current demand for lots of H in anime, but it's annoying nonetheless. In particular, the obsessive attention payed to the bodies of Suguha and Lyfa is, to say the least, obnoxious. If I want excessive H, there are plenty of doujin manga, H anime and adult games that I can turn to. I can't stand when something becomes over-sexualized that previously wasn't. Still, I can't deny its power to pull in the fanboys, so if emphasis on curvy bodies is your thing, then you will love the second arc. 
One other feature that is guaranteed to agonize some viewers is the time skips. There are several throughout SAO, and after each one occurs there are inevitably several changes that are not explained; characters will have new gear, relationships will have been formed or strengthened, floors will have been conquered, and revelations will have been made. As viewers, we are not privy to much of this information. Like I said, this will bother some viewers to no end, but others (especially fans of very vague anime like Haibane Renmei) will realize that what happened in between doesn't really matter. Yes, at some point Kirito changes from his Queen's Nightblade to his Elucidator, but do we really need to know how he got it? Yes, there's a huge skip between the fight against the boss of floor one in episode two and Kirito's sudden position as solo player representative in the lead group, but do the events in between really matter? We're all familiar with many mainstream shounen anime, and we know how anime with a fight-of-the-week plot are structured, so we can accurately assume what has happened on floors two, three, and so on. 
Despite my criticisms, I have to admit that I enjoy the anime immensely. Not quite as much as the original novels, but the feeling is there. It's a bit of a guilty pleasure, considering how many things I can identify to myself that I don't care for about it. But regardless, it's a very enjoyable anime. By far not the greatest of the thousands of series floating around, but definitely worth the 20 minutes of my time per episode. 
I'll very briefly touch on some other areas, since I know many viewers have a limited interest in production techniques and plot subtleties and instead prefer to analyze things like animation and musical score quality. 
Let it be known that the musical score is done by Kaijura Yuki, which practically by default means it's fantastic. The music is also used at the proper times and is well-suited to the scenes in which it appears. The OP and ED themes are nice enough to be enjoyable, but not to the extend that I wanted to get them for myself. 
The animation is good quality. Not fantastic, but nothing to complain about, either. I like the character designs, the backdrops had a good amount of attention put into them, and the battle scenes are good enough to impress me. Colorful, but not garishly so. Not the most realistic art style I've seen, but its clean, proportionate and detailed enough that it doesn't look like a kids show, either.
I hate summarizing, but I know that many people won't bother with the wall-of-text and will just skip to the numbers instead, so:
Plot: 7 (courtesy to the TRUE plot, not the side-stories that became common filler in this adaptation)
Characters: 6 (nothing new here, but not awful either)
Sound: 9 (gotta love Kaijura Yuki)
Animation: 7 (generally good quality, but not many ""wow"" moments)
Enjoyment: 7 (enough to always keep me hooked, and enough to hang around in my mind for hours after each episode)
Overall: 7 (7 simple means ""good,"" and good is what SAO is)
If you have time to waste, watch it. You may not jump on the bandwagon, but you likely won't regret watching it.",7
"
                This is a perfect example for how wrong can people is when they judge a book by its cover.
In the near future, mankind has invented a hi-tech device that simple help them to live in virtual world, in this case, it's the world of fantasy games. The story begins when our main character gets trapped in a game, that's if they die in game, they die outside too. Sounds like an awesome start for an adventure hah ?  Well but unfortunately, it's not what SAO is about.
What's SAO about? It's about a game maniac kid named Kirito- a beta tester, a solo player, that
                  leaves all his mates, suddenly become one of the strongest characters in the game for unclear reason. To make it worse, each ep has a random girl falls for him for no reason at all. My god, this's not a harem anime for god's sake.
And in the end of this arc, you know what happened to Kirito when he died in this game... ( SPOILERS ALERT) 
HE STAYED ALIVE 
Well i wouldnt have so much to criticize if the anime stops when this arc ends. But somehow it continues, introduce more girls to fall for Kirito and s on with no motivation at all.
I give it a 4 only because of Asuna, Asuna alone. Who i love very much in the beginning and through out the first arc but somehow get sideline to support character. That's so sad.",4
"
                I’ve reread my review and discovered I wasn’t fully satisfied with it. So I’m trying again.
SAO is one of those series that I thought I just really disliked at first, and then realized it had transcended into complete hatred. This should go without saying, but I will say it right now: I do NOT hate or dislike people who like and enjoy this anime. I have nothing against them. I actually understand why this anime is held in such a high regard and even hailed as something of a masterpiece. But this is a series I find far from a 
masterpiece.
So to begin with the
                  story, I’m going to come out right now and say that I’m not a gamer. I’m not here because I’m really into gaming and I’m upset about the mechanics of SAO or any of the technicalities. But even people who are die-hard gaming fans have probably taken notice that this isn’t the best representation of good gaming story. Let’s find out why this story just doesn’t work.
If you don’t know the story of SAO, I’ll say right now I’m surprised. But I also trust that you’re intelligent enough of a person to read the synopsis, so I’ll spare you the time. I found SAO’s story to be pretty generic and awfully predictable. Now, there’s nothing wrong with this, but it does leave a very bland aftertaste on the viewer. But I really wasn’t into it. There wasn’t any intensity or moments when I thought the characters were in real danger (we’ll get to them in a minute), and it’s kind of… weak. I can go on and on all day about how the Fairy Dance arc was painful, but I’m just going to sum up my basic reaction to the series in one word: boring. That’s right. And this problem occurs not only from the lack of tension, but also the fact that this series has no substance. Now, I’m not saying that a series needs to be deep or thought-provoking to be interesting. Not at all. But the depth of what the viewer is left with resembles what a middle schooler might come up with. The last and biggest part of what I want to say about the story are our two arcs. The first arc was just really dumb. It broke its own rules that the game had set, there was a whole clutter of ideas, and the timeskips really didn’t help. I can’t really blame the actual writer for this, because part of this issue does come from its adaptation from the light novels. The author, Kawahara Reki, originally wrote the main story’s arc, then had several separate light novel stories put out detailing Kirito’s side stories with some of the other characters he encountered. However, the anime adapted both story arcs at the same time, and, well… those filler episodes are kind of a snoozefest. The second arc of the story, Fairy Dance Arc, is just painfully boring. I’m not saying that Aincrad arc wasn’t, but I don’t recall it being as dull and uninteresting as this one. This is based off of the fact that Fairy Dance stretched out for far longer than it needed to. The story insults my intelligence, and while I may not be a gamer, there are some things in this series that left me just wondering “… what? That’s so dumb!” Yeah, folks. There are some pretty dumb moments in this anime. You can count on it.
Okay, so if the story was pretty bad and honestly rather dull, then the characters must be more promising, right? Wish I could tell you otherwise.
SAO really adds salt to the injury of a story it’s created with its characters. Again, I don’t care if anyone out there really likes these characters. Kirito’s your favorite hero? Totally cool. Asuna’s the best heroine ever? Fine with me. But these are some of the dullest, most boring characters I’ve ever encountered. Really.
Let’s begin with our two main protagonists: Kirito and Asuna. Kirito is everything that a boy wants to be: the tough, cool, dark, loner guy who gets all the girls. Too bad he’s incredibly bland and so unengaging. Kirito would have been forgettable if I hadn’t seen him absolutely everywhere that people said the word “anime” and the fact that I remembered him for being so bland. Kirito is a Gary Stu in its finest form. He even gets a guy to fall for him. No joke. To be completely honest, I don’t hate Kirito because he was despicable or frustrating, but because everyone hails this guy as the best person ever, and he really contradicts his own “personality”. Possibly the only character trait going for this guy is the fact that half the stuff he does in the series doesn’t even make sense. And we can’t forget how incredibly overpowered he is. I don’t really mind this, but if being overpowered is a character’s only character trait, then, well… I don’t know what to tell you. You haven’t satisfied me in any way.
Asuna is just a little better. I hold her to a slightly higher standard because I thought she wasn't quite as bad as Kirito. She’s nothing exceptional, and much like Kirito, she has absolutely no character development and is honestly quite boring. But I kind of liked her character design, and then is the fact that she’s the only character who appears to say anything that makes any sense at all. But she’s just as uninteresting as Kirito. I won’t lie, there were times when I believed that their romance did actually kind of work. But it does collapse in on itself because there’s not much buildup and the romance isn’t really developed. However, it was sort of cute at times. Not the worst aspect of the story, but just as underdeveloped. And it was better than Kirito’s little romances with all the other girls in the series. However this does not excuse Asuna from being dull and really a lame excuse for a “strong” character. Not satisfied with her.
I’m going to make it brief with the side characters. They’re just ok. Yeah. Nothing noteworthy, and truth be told, I only really remembered them because they’re on the cover of most of SAO’s posters and they even get their own little clips in the opening. But they just hop in and hop out. Realistically, the story could exist with Kirito, Asuna, and maybe the two villains, and I bet the story would end the exact same way. I feel like I should tough on Suguha, but she served only to drag the arc out, and her character arc was so predictable. There’s no purpose to it. The love triangle she tries to create will never exist because Kirito is always going to be with Asuna, and I almost felt bad for Suguha because she will never be developed. Not to mention that she was really boring and painfully unnecessary. Oh, and we can’t forget the fanservice she brings to the story, because that’s really her only purpose. But there’s a lot of fanservice in the Fairy Dance Arc anyway. I’ve managed to turn a blind eye to fanservice, especially when it doesn’t contribute anything to the plot, but the more I watched this, the more uncomfortable I felt, like this was made for someone several years younger than me. And this doesn’t just go for Suguha, but for all the female fanservice (because that’s why most of them are here, even Asuna at times).
The villains aren’t intimidating by any means, and they don’t bring any tension to the story. But of course, our two main protagonists are so awesome, there’s no way these guys could ever pose a threat. They’re forgettable. Nothing memorable about them. Heck, the first guy even forgets his motivation. He says so himself.
The sound in this anime is ok, but nothing too memorable. Nothing atrocious, though. The openings were kind of catchy, but the only reason I remember either of them is because they’re everywhere, just like everything else in the series. The one thing I will give credit to this series for is the fact that I kind of liked the second ending. It wasn’t moving or anything, but it was sweet enough.
The art style is alright, but it's definitely not one of my favorites. The backgrounds are pretty good, though, and it looks like a world I would want to explore. It’s a shame we never do. However, if anything is to hold this art and animation down, it’s the fight scenes. They really aren’t all that well choreographed, and the tension is really drained from them, because we know our two main characters are going to make it through to the end.
I gave this anime a few liberties before, but SAO is one of those series where the more I think about it, the more I think about how I dislike it. Just to say this again, just because I hated this series, does not mean that I hate people who enjoyed it. Nope. Nada.
One thing I do want to say is that I don’t hate this series because it’s popular. Yes, the hype does damage the experience, and it is everywhere. I hate this series because I find the writing to be horrible, the characters atrocious, and I really didn’t enjoy it. I do take pleasure at ripping into this thing with my review, but I really don’t want to get into any fights about it. I can’t stand this anime, and I think it’s an insult to my intelligence and was a waist of my time. If you like it, cool. Whatever. But this anime won’t be getting any love from me. Overall, Sword Art Online is boring, dull, and has a painfully uninteresting and characters that are cardboard cutouts of their own tropes. A nice 1/10 will finish this off for me.",1

                Now, before I start on my review, I have to warn you of a few things... This will contain some profanity and some minor spoilers, so read at your own risk! Spoilers, yikes!
My enjoyment of this anime can be summed up in one question: Why did I even finish this thing? Now, the key word in that sentence is ""finish"". The anime started out pretty well. The concept is interesting, the art is gorgeous, and the pace is just right. However, as the anime progressed, it turned into a torturous ordeal. It's like watching a battle, but not really a battle, 'cause Ares is chilling
                  in the middle of the scene, strolling his immortal ass around, bullying poor soldiers. That is the vibe I get out of Kirito.
Speaking of Kirito, let me start with my rating of the characters: 2/10
I really have a bone to pick with several characters, so please be patient and sit through my long character-bashing session.
Kirigaya Kazuto: Before I go on, I must tell you. I hated this character. If you like a character who has super-powers when all other characters are normal humans, gets all the girls FOR NO FREAKING REASON, and has no depth whatsoever, then this character is for you! Okay, I have to admit. I like ""lone wolf"" characters, but man, Kirito is just waaaaaaaaaaay over the top. From clearing dungeons to fighting bosses, this guy is so badass, he does all of them SOLO... I mean seriously! All the other characters seem pathetic compared to him. I sat through the entire anime watching this little bastard beat the crap out of everything. Not exactly enjoyable.
Yuuki Asuna: Asuna started out as a pretty promising character. She is defiant, skilled, and most importantly, pretty damn hot. I saw her badass-ness during the fight with the first boss, and thought: ""Dang, she's just as cool as Kirito."" And then she ruins it by spending her skill points on cooking just so she could make Kirito a sandwich. Seriously! A sandwich. Despite all the things she could make that won't perpetuate the gender stereotype, she chose a to make sandwich. As expected (ever since she made a sandwich), in the remainder of the anime she turned into a heap of baggage for Kirito to save just so he could play the knight in shiny armour saving a damsel in distress.
Silica: Twin pigtail little sister type loli. Not much to say.
Yui: Long black haired loli. Not much to say except that her reappearance in ALO is pretty bull.
Lizbeth: Who's this character again? I totally forgot about her due to her lack of screen time...
Kirigaya Suguha: Okay. So I think the creators of SAO just went: ""Hmmm... We don't have enough girls for Kirito's harem... who should we add? Oh, I know! Since imouto's are the fad these days, let's add a little sister! But we can't make her his real sister, cause that'll be gross, so let's make her his cousin, but still calls him 'onii-chan' because they're close like a pair of real siblings. And we have to remember to add in some bull about Kirito's parents' misfortune so we can get a few feels out of the viewers."" But hey, Suguha's voice actor is the same one as Kirino's, so I can't argue with that.
Kayaba Akihiko: ""Watching someone else play a RPG is not fun."" This guy said the best line in the entire anime, and I salute him for that. Otherwise I have no further complaints except that his avatar in SAO is pretty lame.
Sugou Nobuyuki: This is one of the worst villains I have seen. I felt like the author ran out of ideas for good villains after he killed off Akihiko. The moment you set eyes on him, you know that he's a slimy, evil person. It was so explicit he might as well have taped a sign to his head saying: ""I'm the villain for the rest of the anime!"" In the end, when everything is resolved, I kind of feel bad for him, though. He was so pathetic that I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. Poor guy, he just wanted Asuna's love.
Sinon: Oh wait, wrong season. My bad.
And a bunch of other minor characters whom you don't even give a damn about.
That basically sums up the characters of SAO.
And now, we proceed to the plot: 3/10
Or rather: the lack of a plot. The entire plot of SAO can be summarized into ""Kill monsters. Pick up girls. Kill bosses. Pick up more girls. Wedding. Kill more monsters. Have a duel just so Kirito can show his mad skills, but lost cause the other side cheated. Kirito beats the heck out of everything. Final boss battle out of the blue. Kirito wins. Hurray for Kirito!""
The entire plot of ALO is pretty similar as well, and it follows this module: ""Asuna is missing. New game. FAIRIES!! Pick up your own cousin. Fight some people. Fight more people. Have a duel just so Kirito can show his mad skills. Fight some more people. Meets bad guy. Wins in game. Wins in real life. Asuna is saved! Hurray for Kirito once again!""
As for the art: 9/10
The art in Sword ART Online is very well drawn. The style is a mix between realism and fantasy, giving the viewer a whole lot of immersion in the world. I would say the art style is very well suited for this anime, for its beautiful landscapes are quite captivating and make excellent wallpapers if screenshotted at the correct moments. I would say that the art is what I really enjoyed about the anime, but it is not good enough to overshadow the faults. I wish I could draw like that...
Animations: 8/10
The action scenes in the anime is very well done. Though it is not blood-pumping to see Kirito kick ass, it was quite enjoyable to watch the fancy moves and clashes that lead to Kirito's opponent's inevitable defeat, no matter who he or she was. Come to think about it... Kirito has never fought a woman before... hmmm... Well, except duel with Suguha, which was pretty pleasant, because of the jiggly bits, if you know what I mean. Overall, the animation is quite enjoyable, and made this anime bearable.
Sound: 7/10
I know people would argue otherwise, but for me, there was no real sound track that stood out. The opening was pretty standard for an anime with the catchy beat and exciting tune. I honestly skipped most of the openings and endings in any anime, so most of my sound critique would be on the background music. For SAO, the background music was mediocre. These bgms are your standard music pieces, nothing quite worth a note, but nothing really bad either.
Overall: 4/10
In conclusion, SAO and I have a love-hate relationship. I loved the art style and backgrounds. I even have a whole collection of them as wallpaper for my computer. However, the characters and story were so dreadful that I am marveled at my own resilience for finishing this anime. I would say that SAO wasn't all that bad, but ALO certainly killed the anime for me. Hope this review is helpful for those who want to pick SAO up. My advice would be: if you don't like an anime where the main character is insanely strong, then don't watch this.",4

                I’ve seen a crap ton of reviews about Sword Art Online and I say that it seem that there seems to be a group of people who likes it and another group that doesn’t. Now, i’m just gonna give my two cents about Sword Art Online(which would now be known as SAO) so please bear with me. Now on to the review.
SAO had one of the most promising story that i’ve ever seen, but my expectations were quickly destroyed by the lousy storytelling/narration, slow pacing, and the way it’s presented. The story started with a guy named Kirito, a normal guy who likes Virtual Reality
                  Massive Multiplayer Online Games(VRMMOGs for short). Now, this doesn’t seem interesting at all, but what happens when a simple game like SAO suddenly turns into a matter of life and death, wherein when you die in game, you die in real life? Of course you aren’t allowed to log out, so what do you do, you have to beat the game. Now, with a story that sounds as awesome as that, what made SAO such a bad anime? First off, the pacing itself. The story was going way to fast. It skipped way to many things that it became somewhat episodic, as if the story is made entirely of fillers. It even came to the point wherein I can no longer tell which was canon, and which was not, or if everything was even canon at all. Secondly, the fight scenes were too dull. As a genre focused on fighting(hence the name), I expected better fights than the ones shown in here. I don’t know what went wrong, but it was just lacklustre. The fights were way too slow, compared to the story which was too fast. To put it simply, there was a lack of “epicness” in the fights, and why is something that is hard to put into words. Lastly, the story itself lost its shine after a while. At first it was interesting, but later on it became plain boring. For me, I just felt that it was a chore to watch, which shouldn’t be the case as I was supposed to enjoy it. It felt like I was watching a play with amateur actors. I just can’t feel any emotions from the characters. It couldn’t make me laugh, it couldn’t make me sad, and it definitely didn’t give me the adrenaline rush that I was expecting when I watched this anime.
On top of that, the characters didn’t really grow on me. I felt no attachment to them, unlike when I watched other animes. Don’t get me wrong, the characters had interesting personalities but due to the pacing of the story itself, it didn’t give me enough time to fall in love with the characters, to grow to like them. So in the end, seeing some of them dying or near death doesn’t evoke a feeling of danger within me, and as if it was ok if they just get thrown to the bin since I don’t care about them. Think about it this way. If you have watched Naruto, how did you feel when Ero-Senin died? It doesn’t matter if you cried or not, but you should have at least felt something or at least muttered something like ”aww he died”. But that isn’t the case here. Some of the character aren’t developed enough that it feels like they are expendables which can just be killed later on. They felt hollow, and that is another one of the weak points of this anime.
Now of course, even though the story and the characters weren’t that good, one of the saved this anime was the animation and the sound. Everything was neat and shiny, a trend that can be noticed among the newer animes today. I also can’t deny that the OP, Crossing Field, which is sung by LiSA(she also sung another one of my favourites) , is just awesome. 
Aside from that, there really isn’t much to this anime. I am willing to give it a 7/10 because it just isn’t my cup of coffee, but if you still want to watch it, then be my guest.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, if I’m going to make a comparison between the anime and the light novel, I’m going to say that the anime is utter bullshit compared to the LN. This section isn’t really part of my review, and this will be more of a rant than a review, so read at your own discretion.
I can’t really tell what the fuck happened with the anime. The LN was soooo good, but what really happened? If you have watched the anime before reading the light novel, the first thing that you wil notice is that the LN contained a crapload more details than the anime. Everything was thoroughly explained, and there was a careful attention to detail. Now, in the transition from the LN to the anime, it seems that half of those details and explanations just vanished into thin air. I don’t know what the fuck the producers of the anime were thinking, but in the LN wherein everything was vividly illustrated, the producers just fucked everything up and turned it into a mediocre anime. For example, in the LN, each skill that was used in the series has a name.For example Vorpal Strike,Horizontal ,Linear and some more, but in the anime there was no mention of this. Another example would me about the fights in the LN, the fights were beautifully describes while in the anime, it was more of a “mehhh” than a “THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME”. Also, in the LN, the inner thoughts of the characters where well written, providing us with insight on what the characters are thinking about. This also helped in character development as we can see how they’re way of thinking changed over time but in the anime, it clearly wasn’t there. Although as much as I hate to say this, It is painfully obvious that SAO is more suited as a LN and that turning it into an anime might just be a stupid money  grab, and this will remain as my opinion unless the anime changes otherwise.",7

                Welcome there fellow anime lover and/or gamer to my review of the popular show Sword art online. I will try to point out some reasons on why you should (or should not) watch this anime with as less spoilers as possible. But first, let me tell you that I'm personally a gamer so our opinions could differ. That said, let's go!
It is the year of 2022, by which, humans have created a technology known as FullDive, in which every person can get inside a game and control the player as if themselves are in the game. All they have to do is put a helmet-type
                  machine known as the NerveGear on their head and order the game to start. A new genre of games called VRMMOs (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online) has been developed, and the first game to develop is - as the title states - Sword art online. Our protagonist, Kirito, a hardcore gamer and former beta tester jumps into the game for another time (it's not his first time inside the game as he was a beta tester) and as the first day inside the newly released game ends, he, along with the other 10.000 players finds himself trapped inside the game. You might be thinking by now that they could just simply remove the NerveGear off their heads and they would be back to normal life. Here's the catch though! In case the NerveGear is removed from a person's head while it is operational it also damages the brain, thus the person CAN'T leave the game. The only way for the NerveGear to be deactivated is by clearing the game, which isn't as easy as it sounds... The second catch is that if you die inside the game, you die in reality as well AKA: NO RESPAWNS!
Story:
The story divides into two halves: The SAO half and the ALO half. The first part got me HOOKED. It did have a lot of filler though and that made me lose my interest, but then I got interested again as the story progressed. While it is rushed, you will most probably like it. It is filled with emotionally intense moments, intense action-filled scenes and the whole twist made me want to watch the second half like crazy.
Now for the second half:
[SPOILERS] The second half takes place after the game has been cleared, where our protagonist dives in a second game in order to save his beloved one. [/SPOILERS]. While it wasn't NEARLY as good as the first half it did drag me, but what really disappointed me is [SPOILERS] that our female protagonist turns into a ""Princess in distress"" situation(explained later in the characters section)[/SPOILERS]. This alone made watching the second half less than pleasing...
Score: 7/10
Characters:
In terms of characters the show was less good than I originally thought. The whole cast consists of 2 main characters and later a two more (the first one got me pretty pissed off...). There is our hardcore gamer and solo player protagonist Kirito, wishing to protect his friends from any harm, all while fighting on the front lines and contributing to clearing the game. Then there is our main female character Asuna, a strong warrior joining a guild and fighting on the front lines, and then there is Yui, an AI character that helps Kirito and Asuna in various situations and later on acting as a navigation pixie in the second half (This is the part that pissed me off...). In the main cast, the final character is Suguha, Kirito's sister.
During the first and the second half the development is minimum to non-existing, as the story is fairly rushed and displayed in a really quick way, all while many side characters jump in (and out) of the show and not leaving their ""footsteps"" behind. Needless to say, this made them easily forgetable.
Another thing I need to add, as I said in the Story section, is that our female lead turns from a strong warrior who would really fight whenever it was necessary to a ""damsel in distress"" situation. She becomes really weak and cannot do anything in the situation she's stuck in. This ruined the experience even more for me...
Score: 4/10
Art:
In terms of art, the whole show is crafted really well and could even be called a masterpiece by some people. The atmosphere is really well made and suits perfectly the scenes, all along with good animation during the fight scenes.
Score: 9/10
Soundtrack:
The OST was really fitting for the whole show, covering all scenes with good music. The first OP was really well made along with the second ED, and got me to remember them even after I finished the show.
Score: 8/10
Recap:
While the story did start well and progressed well, the presence of the side characters and the non-existing development of the main characters made the whole experience pretty boring. While there were good parts that got me hooked on my couch, the most part was pretty boring and didn't give me a good feel after finishing an episode. If you are a gamer though, you will pretty much like the whole plot. In terms of enjoyment it did give me a nice feel and made me forget about the filler episodes. I would recommend it, truth be told, but not as much as some other series.
Score: 6/10",6
"
                Just to summarize. I saw Sword Art Online a while back now so it’s not completely fresh in my mind. Regardless, I have a lot of time to consider and concisely put together my feelings and thoughts on this show. This will be a completely independent scoring as to what the show is on my list, simply because my list is usually just based on my immediate entertainment value. With that being said, let’s jump right into Sword Art Online. 
We begin our story in a modern-futuristic setting where humanity is taking its first or at least near-first steps into vrmmo technology.  Our protagonist,
                  Kirigaya Kazuto is a former beta tester for a brand new game that has just been released. Something of a recluse who does not socialize often, Kirigaya or his avatar ‘Kirito’ spends an unhealthy amount of time gaming. We’re introduced to the beautifully designed and innovative world of sword art online, which supposedly includes numerous systems and mechanics that have never been seen before in any other vrmmo. It’s a beast, and everyone is playing it. 
Then suddenly, wouldn't you know, plot happens and the game-master suddenly gathers the player base in one place to declare that they’re all a part of some forsaken death game in which they cannot log-out and if they die in the game, their head-sets will be completely fried. Funnily enough, at this moment, all of the character’s avatars are disabled and replaced with actual representations of the player. I personally thought this was a stroke of genius, and comedy for the entire five seconds in which it was relevant. So from there on, we get to see how Kirito perseveres and survives in this hostile vrmmo where the only way to win, is for the players to conquer all one hundred floors of ‘Aincrad’.
Story – 5 (Mediocre) 
What I just summarized, in my opinion, sounds pretty damned cool and interesting. Immediately, Sword Art Online already appeals to a large demographic, the gaming community which extends just beyond people who watch anime. I don’t know a single gamer out there who hasn’t at least once thought about what it would be like to play a game in a virtual world as a first-hand experience. Sword Art Online sets up and creates a majestic, intricate universe with a seemingly impossible objective and dark survival game tones that can have a psychological bearing, and perhaps lead to some introspective explorations of the dangers of entertainment and escapism… or you would think so at least. When I started watching this, I immediately drew comparison with the .hack franchise, but unlike the .hack franchise, Sword Art Online fails to deliver on possibly one of the strongest points it could have. The psychological effect on the gamer, what can these conditions do to people over extended periods of time? How does this process change one’s thinking, and mentality? You get the idea. 
The progression of the story suffers deeply from a lack of focus or direction, strange considering there’s a somewhat clear objective in sight. Clear all one hundred levels, escape the death trap – but no. Somewhere before the mid part of the series, all of these darker concepts seem to get abandoned and replaced by extremely weird filler episodes that introduce a seemingly meaningless character that will never serve as a core aspect, or even a primary re-occurring existence throughout the series. So on one hand we have all of these weird little sub-plots that never seem to tie together or lead anywhere, and then we have equally as bad pacing – and then extremely cheesy and fairy tale romance that looks like it belongs in an erotic novel. (See the erotic sword art online light novel chapter to see what I’m getting at here, it’s worth a laugh and easy to find translations) All in all – it makes the climax appear rather rushed and unsatisfying, though that only refers to the first half of the series. 
The second half of the series feels like an altogether different show, aside from the characters. I actually like the second half’s settings which is often a subject of criticism, but there’s nothing wrong with it in the slightest. It’s well defined, beautifully designed and is a solid concept. If not for its positioning, placement and being suddenly shoe-horned in after the rushed climax of the prior arc, I think it would have served as a better chapter in the SAO story. 
So just to summarize. I think the entire concept is solid, and initially held a wealth of potential but there was a clear failure to execute these things and they come off as underwhelming simply because of their presentation and ill-timed placement. 
Art- 8 (Very Good) 
I think the visual presentation of Sword Art Online is stunning. I do not have a solid opinion on what good ‘art’ in anime is, but for me at least, Sword Art Online delivers on that front with dozens of extremely beautiful concept pieces, backgrounds and soft character designs. The world itself is extremely detailed. I feel the character designs are far too generic and basic but at least they are presentable. The special effects are great to watch, and the fight scenes themselves as rather spectacular. I don’t have any criticisms on this front barring the generic nature of primary characters. Kirito looks like a copy and paste job. 
Sound – 8 (Very Good)
I’m absolutely in love with certain pieces of the sound-track, and the music fits the flow of the series extremely well. There’s not a single part of it that I think stands out in-particular however. I haven’t done any research into the musicians nor do I have a great understanding of music so there’s little for me to elaborate on here. In my opinion? It is good overall and enjoyable. Though I think they should have played on the game element a little more and brought out some video game sound-effects, music, etc just to push those nostalgia buttons. 
Character – 1 (Pathetic)
This is where we get to the main core of Sword Art Online’s myriad of small but overwhelming problems. I’ll go through and examine the primary characters, one by one to point out what I believe to be the main problems with this series;
Kirito – The Protagonist – 
Kirito is extremely bland and generic, a typical gary-stu who cannot possibly ever develop or change. Everyone is instantly attracted to his care-free and heroic, selfless personality. (I think this has improved of late but I’m referring to SAO here) kirito’s irl problems are extremely minor and inconsequential, in my opinion. He is physically well, rather attractive and just lacks flaws. He’s an overall flawless character template who would never do anything selfish or bad. At times he just does not even feel human.
 It’s funny because we see moments in which he performs what many would consider to be morally reprehensible acts but these are often for the ‘good’ of his friends, and we never really see the impact the game has had on him. There are a sparse few moments in which we see him cry, or breakdown but these feel extremely forced and never really go anywhere. Kirito is the same character at the end of the series as he was right at the beginning, only now he has a harem of girls flocking to him.
Asuna – The Heroine –
Asuna was a mystery figure at first and didn't come into play until later episodes. She was better left a mystery, in my opinion. Once the character came out of the shadows, she was revealed to be no more than Kirito’s online sandwich waifu g.i.r.l heart throb. 
Honestly, if she had turned out to be a G.I..R.L. it would have been far more interesting. Asuna, like Kirito, has EXTREMELY minor problems irl to the extent some consider her escapism border-line pathetic. She by no means, comes across as someone you would normally find in an MMO and this can be said about the majority of the female characters. Asuna had potential to be a very strong female lead, but ultimately she’s bottled into the damsel in distress role after being used as nothing but a forced romance character. 
As a gamer who often frequents role-playing servers, their relationship reminded me of the numerous times I have been a part of a guild, and there’ll be two players who are always together somewhere having a little lost romance fantasy. More often than note, these end in drama, deceit and a myriad of other complications. There are much darker sides to meeting people on the internet than Sword Art Online does not seem to consider and my suspension of disbelief can only be stretched so far. It’s certainly no .hack. 
Now see. I’d mention all of the other characters but…. Aside from the two mentioned above, none of the cast has a slight amount of screen time or development. Nearly the entire re-occurring, if ever occurring cast are female and all have the hots for Kirito but are otherwise more or less void of personality beyond an extremely simple archetype. 
There’s one other male character that barely serves as comedy relief fodder. The ‘antagonist’ rarely ever makes an appearance and is once more, shoe-horned in quite spontaneously. I still to this day do not think his ‘motives?’ were worth the expense of thousand of human lives, and his motives to this day are still questionable. What the villain was trying to achieve appeared rather nonsensical In line with his methods, or simply too vague to draw a conclusive opinion on. 
Overall, the one dimensional characters really let this series enter the crap pile.
Enjoyment – 6 (fair)
Honestly. Sword Art Online isn't the best show on the market like some people claim it is, but it’s not the worst either. You’ll notice a lot of people will either throw this on the hate or like list, but I like to sit somewhere in-between. I couldn't possibly have a strong opinion on a show, negative or otherwise if it did not offer some enjoyment value. Give it a try. Compare it to similar shows like .hack or Log Horizon. My advice would be, just try and be critical and don’t let the pretty graphics and sound-track drag you away from forming a descriptive opinion. Don’t be too drawn in by the either spiteful or borderline SAO cultist side of the fences. 
Overall - 6 (Fair)
An overall train-wreck which serves as decent if not fleeting entertainment value, one day to hopefully be forgotten. Fails to deliver on any basis of realism on every vital area of human interest, achieves in creating hype for the future of gaming (when we’ll all be long dead), fails to deliver an inside look into the game addict, or gamer psyche, fails to deliver on any realistic romance or sense of danger and the characters are enough to make you fall asleep.  
A good popcorn anime. Advertises more than it is in its plot/themes/etc, but cannot for the life of it deliver strongly on any of those points. 
For further recommendations, I’d say give Accel World a try. A light novel by the same writer. I personally think it’s much better.",6

                Welcome to the most hated anime! But why? Because this is the general opinion. You know how all Android users hate Apple users because they pay more just to have something that is NOT as special as their android right? This goes mostly the same. People hate it because they don't want it to gain more popularity. Now some people may think that I actually say that SAO doesn't have bad points. No no no, it has bad points. But it also has good points. But most people only see the bad ones because they are bored to see how much attention it receives. I'd
                  like to make it a little better. Its annoying to see how much hate can a good anime get.
Story, lets be serious, if you don't know the story of this anime at this point in time you are either new to anime or completely ignorant. As we know, we have Kirito who is trapped in an virtual reality online game where if you die once you die in real life. From here people either kill themselves to test that ( smart right? ) or start killing others ( smarter right? ). Anyway, our hero will try to end this game to free everyone. He is OP in everything that has to do with warfare, and somehow gets a harem, but of course he is only interested in the female character Asuna. Asuna is .. you could say even more perfect than Kirito. She is a goddess or something like that. Well, after 15 episode or so, you get a classical Mario ending ( The princess is in another castle ) and we start again with another VR online game. Until now you might hate this anime to the core. But, we have good things. The idea is original in the anime genre, being the first one to create such a setting. The villain being someone closer that it was believed at first, also became a good point. The love story went well ( the bad part being the characters themselves ). And the actual fighting was awesome. Well thought moves and skills.  For me, the story gets a 6.
Art, I can hardly understand why people could even begin to complain about the art. When anime like ""Ping pong the animation"" gets a almost full marks in this category I feel like puking each time I try to understand why someone can simply rate it as bad just because he or she can't stand something from another category. We have a fluid artwork that is great to see especially in the fighting scenes. The scenery was sometimes breathtaking and other times eerie. The characters were designed to be either cute as sugar or nasty as crap. But that's just how the author wanted them to be seen. In my opinion, art can get a 9.
Sound, if you have a problem with the sound you have a problem with Yuki Kajura that made the soundtracks for Fate/Zero and Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Those series obtained the highest marks possible in this category but once again were hated in this anime because of one big problem from another category. The openings and ending from both parts were absolutely great, and I don't think there is an anime fan who hasn't listened to them at least twice or thrice. Once again, a 9.
Characters .. Sorry, I know that I praised two categories one after another, and that may be biased, but I won't make a review just for that. In my opinion, the characters were, simply, clearly and absolutely DREADFUL.  From the first to the last they were puppets created just so the author could live his fantasies. None have any depth, none have any logical background, all of them are so shallow that you can either ignore completely or see them as just side characters that weren't meant to be. From me, with all the possible love, a 2.
Enjoyment - I watched it. Not once, but twice ( i was bored ) and I could watch it from the beginning until the end. I felt annoyed sometimes, that's true, but sometimes I felt like I could really enjoy it. In other words, a 7.
Overall -  If you haven't watched many anime's and wish to be immersed into one, watch it. Depending on your mentality it can strongly attract you. If not, well, it may be good as a reference in the genre as it has a huge amounts of cliches. It receives a 7.",7

                I've been thinking about how I am going to be writing these comments since last night. I want to give this show my best writing ability, because I think it deserves it. I see a lot of negativity around this show within certain Anime circles. However, I believe the key ingredient in those discussions is that this is Anime when compared to the level of others, struggles. 
	For me, I haven't been watching Anime very long, so my level of expectation isn't as high as those who have watched hundreds of Anime's. With that in mind, this has been one of my most absolute enjoyable
                  shows that I have watched in recent memory. I genuinely experienced withdrawals when I wasn't watching the show, and I was constantly craving more. This could be a confluence of multiple factors. I have been a long time MMO'er, and gamer for close to 20 years. This show really struck a nostalgic chord in terms of MMO's and the social aspect of them for me. I felt myself craving a game like SAO or just an MMO in general that I could dive into on the level that the show portrays. The entire premise of this show is absolutely addicting to me, I would never logoff if this kind of technology was real. 
	I don't have a lot of basis to compare from other Anime's, e.g. what defines ""good"" Characters, Story, Narrative, etc. However, I absolutely adore the characters from this show, and find myself very invested in them, and their futures. Especially the main overarching love story, I absolutely fell in love with Kirito(Kazuto) and Asuna. I could not stop watching until I found out what happened with them. This show brought tears to my eyes multiple times, and I just cannot give it enough praise. On the flip side of that, there IS a lot of untapped potential in this show. I think there is just too much potential for it to be squeezed into 25 episodes. The amount of original ideas this show could spawn, could easily make a show like this run hundreds of episodes. Which I think, is one of the main complaints folks have. A LOT happens over the course of these 25 episodes, probably too much. However, I am ok with that, because I believe what this show was truly meant to be about was handled well enough to leave me satisfied. It's possible for others to say that the show should have been handled differently because of this, however from someone who has played dozens of MMO's, I have seen stories like this happen(obviously not in such extreme circumstances), and I think the world is simply a setting for the story that is being told. 
	The world, or the game(s), that the majority of this show(season) takes place in, is so wonderful. I am so into the world, and would love to find out more about these worlds. I want to dive into them, and really find out more and explore, just like a real MMO. It was just so easy for me to get lost in the show, there was just so much I enjoyed. As mentioned above, there wasn't AS MUCH detail about the world that there could have been, but from what I saw, it was enough for me(obviously I want more, who doesn't want more of an Anime they love(d)?
	Every show has it's flaws, the show isn't as much about the actual game SAO as it could be, and there's some pacing issues, a lot of the side points of the stories just happen in between episodes(the characters stay developing but there is a lot going on behind the scenes). I think this show was really meant more as a love story with some brutal villians than a show that revolves around an MMO. Everyone can find things to complain about, and this show is by no means perfect. However, at face value, it is a great show for what it is. 
	At the end of the day, for someone who is freshly coming into Anime, I think this would be a great place to start. If you have any love for MMO's, or RPG-esque love stories, or shows which just flat out make you want more. Keep an open mind, and give this show a shot. I cannot recommend it enough, and I have no doubt that some people out there will absolutely adore and enjoy this show like me. On the flip side, I am sure there are folks who will not enjoy this. 
	One thought I always try to take when I look for a new Anime to watch is that if I am even remotely interested in a show, why not give it a go? Sure I may end up not enjoying it, but I also may completely love it to death and it could become my favorite Anime of all time. Watching as much Anime as possible gives you so many opportunities to refine your tastes, and helps you discover what you truly like and don't like. 
Disclaimer; these are just my opinions. In no way do I expect everyone to love this show, I am just giving my opinion and hoping to help more folks out there discover that they can truly enjoy this show.
Also, if you happen to be watching or considering letting your kids watch this show, there is some pretty gnarly stuff that goes on in the last couple of episodes that I would highly recommend you not let anyone under the age of 18 watch. There's no nudity or anything like that, but the implications and visuals shown I would never let my kids watch(10 and 13). It just flat out isn't appropriate for that age range.",8

                SAO is a good series when it slows down and focusses on heartwarming moments and relationship angst. As well, the world-building made me want to go into the game (on the grounds that the RL version wouldn’t be a deathtrap.) All the same, Sword Art Online ends up feeling overhyped in the end, because the great story comes with some fatal flaws in the way it's told.
SAO's main problem is its pacing. The series tries to jam several books worth of content into 25 episodes, subplots included. A major climactic battle will be shoved into half an episode, right after a filler episode about helping
                  a character that - while charming - doesn't have an important part in the overall story. SAO should have made a choice that it refused to make: Focussing solely on the main arc, or only telling a few book's worth of story like 'The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya' did. 
Of course, not all of the pacing issues are just from the size of the source material: the series can't seem to fit in time to develop antagonists, but have no problem dedicating 10 minutes of several episodes to creepy fanservice that feels so degrading as a female viewer, it alone is the reason I marked this series down from a 7 to a 6. 
Ultimately, SAO was a decent romp, but so much opportunity was missed thanks to the way the adaptation was handled. Being a lover of JRPGs, science fiction, and romance, this had every opportunity to be one of my favorite series had it been handled better. Instead, Sword Art Online is just another anime that was good enough to watch all the way through, but not good enough to really care about afterwards.",6
"
                When my friend suggested to watch this anime I was kind of sceptical - and I don't know why - however in the end I was even amazed, how much great ideas this anime threw at me, which I could use as an inspiration for my own stories.
Yes, the story itself of this anime isn't anything worth mentioning. Everything is as described in a summary and nothing particular doesn't come back after you have watched it - slow, not particularly fabulous aftertaste. But there was something more to it, what dragged me back wanting more - some kind of enchantment!
Characters are done quite good. Everyone
                  had their own background with it's own story of how they ended up playing the game, why should or shouldn't they fight for survival etc. I particularly liked a minute long period at the very beginning when anime showed the real thing behind every character, when woman characters showed that in real life they are men and their description didn't fit the made up look, however I felt a need for such reality more often as further on in the anime it didn't kicked back anymore - neither the same idea, nor other kind, which can be seen in real life!
Although season is 25 episodes long, it lacked sustainability - with this I mean it didn't came up with action as often as I felt the need for it. Overall plot moves on quite slow although months passed by rather fast without actually showing what have happened between them as nothing particular had changed during that time.
I would re-watch it just for the warm family-type feeling the middle of the season gives and last few episodes for the shivers conclusion brings, although I anticipated most of the twists in advance. But overall enjoyment I got from this anime was enough to persuade me to look for another season.",8
"
                Sword art online is the most random anime that i liked.Its story was about clear a game.

"
                Alright guys. I know probably know how many times you've seen my username pop up in the ""SAO REVIEW."" I just wanted to try reviewing this again, making it better each time. Well, here goes nothing.
I give SAO  a 9. What?? A 9?? Why 9?? 
Story 10/10- Wait, hold up. Before you click the ""unhelpful"" button or skip my review for giving it a 10, please, hear me out. The premise, as everyone knows already, is about some OP guy named Kirito who happened to be trapped in a game called Sword Art Online. To clear the game, you have to clear every floor.
                  What's even better is that if you die in the game, you die in real life. WHOO. Interesting right?? Then you got your beautiful OP Asuna, partnering up with her man Kirito. It smells like a ship. The first episode was amazing, sets up the whole story. Or does it?? Only until episode 14, it seems. I recommend not watching the second half, because that, my friend, is where the garbage starts. 
Art 10/10- The art is beautiful though, as expected of something that came from A-1 pictures.
Sound 10/10- These are the bonus points. Kajiura Yuki is the best. No flaws here.
Character 7/10- This is where a lot of people have lots of complaints. Let me start with Kirito. If you don't like OP characters, then you can get out of here.  Because Kirito is so badass that he can't die. He's a beta tester, so of course he's going to have more knowledge than every other player in that game. He's also so handsome and friendly that every girl wants him. That sets for Kirito. Then there's Asuna. In the first few episodes, Asuna used to be cool, but then she became a damsel in distress and complete trash when she can't even stand without Kirito. I must admit the romance is kind of cute though. Okay, enough about Asuna. Let's talk about Yui, their AI ""daughter."" Yui is honestly not needed in this series. Lmao. That's all I have to say. For the villains part, they are trash indeed. The first villain, Heathcliff, has forgotten why he even was the villain. The second villain is just plain horrible.
Enjoyment 9/10- I enjoyed this anime however, despite the flaws they have. I enjoyed it because SAO is meant to be entertaining, and it certainly was.
Overall 9/10- If you don't like harem/romance, then go away. SAO's got lots of harem/romance. If you're going to use your brain and tell your brain that none of this makes sense, then go away. This is only good if you're watching this for the sole purpose of entertainment. You have been warned.",9
"
                Why is this in my top 10? I have no clue. I think I just needed a guilty pleasure. This show screws up on SOOOOOOOOOOOO many levels, but I still had fun watching it. I think I'm turning masochistic. Send help.
This will only be a review of season one, as season two is a WHOLE other ballgame(with oddly, the same overall rating from me. huh)
Story: 5
*bangs head on desk*
Not gonna lie: this story is a train wreck. For those unaware, the story has two very distinct arcs. The first is referred to as Sword Art Online (often abbreviated SAO), and the second is Alfheim Online
                  (or ALO).
The SAO arc actually has a solid premise: a few thousand people become trapped in the new VRMMORPG-MP3C3POXKCDLMNOPAARPTTYLROFLMAO. Sorry, got carried away there. The main catch of this RPG is that players cannot leave the game, any attempts from the outside kill them, and if they die in the game, they die for real. It's actually a thrilling premise, and the show's villain, Kayaba, starts off with quite the intimidating entrance. The problem with the SAO arc's story is in the narrative. It's full of poorly executed time jumps, and it often feels like vital information got skipped. (Like, seriously Klein, what happened to that freaking revival item) I'll praise the story in the first three episodes, but after that, it just begins to spiral into chaos and fluff. So much fluff. So many contrived romances.
The ALO arc skips those problems entirely (thank goodness), but it kind of lost something important along the way. Like a GOOD PREMISE. ALO is basically Super Kirito Brothers, and Kirito's princess is in another... video game. Now, as I said earlier, the narrative is fixed, with this arc taking place over only a couple of days, rather than two years of fishing minigames. Plus, this is the arc with the well-written, albeit poorly thought out, romance. I'll touch on that in a bit. Oh, and the villain in this arc is stupid. And a rapist. I HATE this arc.
Art: 8
SAO's high point. This show ALWAYS looks pretty. It's no Fate/Zero, but it's flashy as hell and a JOY to watch. It has a few slow moments, but even then, the art direction is solid. I can't praise it too much, since critiquing art is my weak suit, so let's move on.
Sound: 8
Many would argue that this is Yuki Kajiura's weakest work, and it may well be. HOWEVER, it's still gorgeous. If you don't believe me, go to youtube right now and start listening to Swordland. I'll wait.
You back? Good. As far as voice acting goes, I've got to give props to the actors. In the original Japanese. This is one of the few shows I've ever seen where I listened to the English dub as well and ran for my crucifix. This dub is BAD, especially in episode 3. The original actors put genuine heart and soul into their work, and the dub just sounds so... wooden. Listen to subs, most definitely. Oh, and the openings are phenomenal. Both of them. Watch them now.
Character: 3
*bangs head on desk harder*
It's so bad. I can think of two characters I legitimately liked in this season, and one of those two was in ONE episode. As for the rest of the cast: apathetic at best.
Let's start with our hero: Kirito. He's boring to no end. He'll always win, no matter what. Even if it defies several laws of physics/program rules. (seriously, you gave Klein a revival item in episode 3, and never explained it being used in the show. Why didn't you use it to save Kirito? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY?) Calling Kirito a Mary-Sue would be an insult to Mary-Sues. Plus, harem king. FOR NO REASON.
Next up is our female lead, Asuna: the biggest insult to tsundere lovers everywhere. She starts off well enough, the resident BAMF of the show. She later becomes a generic love interest, which I was alright with because she could still hold her own in a fight. Then, everything changed when the ALO arc attacked. She gets princess peach'ed and nearly raped. Twice. I. HATE. THIS. ARC.
Next up is one of the two characters I actually enjoyed: Suguha. She's Kirito's cousin/sister, and she starts playing ALO after Kirito gets trapped in SAO. She's the most fanservice-heavy character in the show, but I never felt like she was too bad in that department, though people would disagree with me. (Guys, FMA had cleavage too. It'll be okay. At least it's not HOTD) My big issue with Suguha is her romance subplot. Remember how I said ALO had the well-written romance. Yup, this is it.
So it starts off incestuous. I wouldn't have as much of an issue with the cousin romance thing, since in Japan it's not the taboo that it is in America. (note: I do not endorse or support sexual/romantic relations between cousins, or incestuous relations of any kind. I'm just not here to call out other cultures because of their differences). My issue is that they were raised as BROTHER and SISTER, and that's still a taboo. Seriously, like wtf guys? And to make matters worse, they make her fall in love with Kirito twice, since the two are unaware of the other's RPG personas. Like, don't set up incest and try to make me feel for the girl. BAD Sword Art Online. Got to the corner.
The one other character I liked was Sachi, and she showed up for one episode. She's about the only human character in the show, and in that short time, I felt a connection to her. She was terrified, and alone. You know, how a person should act when faced with life-changing circumstances like SAO. Heck, she gives Kirito's character depth and weakness. For about ten minutes.
The rest of the cast are primarily minor, with only Klein getting any more than one episeode. Well, I mean, there's Agil, but he's got like five lines of dialogue, so he might as well have been in one episode. I stated my thoughts on the villains above.
Enjoyment: 6
This was a roller coaster. At times, I loved the show. The action scenes were glorious. At times, I hated the show. Use the revival item, Klein! Why are you so useless? I'd keep it at five, but I'll be nice and bump it a point for the music's sake.
Overall: 6
Should you watch this show? Only if you'd already set on it. While it's in my top ten, I can't recommend it. It's just not worth it. If you've got nothing better, be my guest. Personally, I'd recommend Log Horizon. The art's not quite as good, but the world building and characters are much better, and at least the faffing about doesn't detract from the story.",6
"
                (you can skip this if you want) 
Okay Firstly I'm just going to say to people that don't understand the story on why they skip so many floors, and only go to the boss battles and stuff. Also why Kirito is strong straight away.
Well if you think about it, people who like this anime must have the experience of playing MMO type games; because in my own opinion if your going to watch this anime you must have interest in games, if not don't even bother watching because you will get bored. I play many MMO games that is why I love this anime so
                  much. 
Anyway's, the reason why they creator skips is maybe because he doesn't want the viewers to get bored. Furthermore when you have experience on MMO games, levelling up can take as long, as you want. So if he didn't 'Skip' he would not have met the target of 25 episode's. If your wondering why he just aimed for 25 episode, is either he is a new creator or he just wants 25 episodes :D. 
now back to my review.
Story- 9: 
I scored this '9' because its the second anime based on MMO RPG games, which I really liked. Furthermore it's actually so amazing how he came up with a game which your life depends on. Having the story skip is not really a main problem, because MMO RPG are massive worlds so you wont expect those characters to keep meeting each other, if they did that would be really be stupid and it would destroy the meaning of ""MMO"". If you guys are wondering why not give episodes of how the characters levelled up, well like I said if they did that it won't meet the target of 25 episodes and that it would look like fillers. Though I would have made the story 10/10 if they hadn't done a random Evil Person in the start of the episode, (the Game Master dude) when he made his appearance well that made me say ""Dafuq?"" well not that its a big problem, it was just that those kind of things (Evil People appearing telling them that you will die here) is too commonly used. :L so yeah.
Art: 8 
The art is amazing, It is so good  Why? because it just what I would  call Fairy tale art, because its a world with floating islands. The reason why I rated it 8 and your probably like ""Wow Floating Island""  in a sarcastic way, the only way to find out is to draw it yourself and you'll see just how hard it is to think about how big the island is and  what it is going to have inside. The monster though are the one that gave it 8 instead of 9, because the monster seemed to be so similar to the monster in ""Ragnarok Animation"" so I'm not really amazed about that.  I'm not saying that all the monster are similar. 
The character look cool, having guild armours and stuff Kirito I think looks the coolest. But yeah that's all I have to say I just think everything is cool.
Sound: 8
yeah the voice actors are good and totally match there character, they have chosen the characters for this anime very well and I think  all the need to improve is to get a better battle music :D.
Character: 9 
I think I have covered that in the Art section.
Enjoyment: 9 
lets just say when I saw the first episode  I went crazy for the next episode.  
Overall: 9
I said that at the start. Sorry for this fail review but yeah I'm in a rush right now cause I'm going abroad.",9

                [Spoiler Warning]
Sword Art Online is an anime nearly everyone (who watches anime) has heard of, watched, and formed their own opinion of. For those of you who have yet to watch it, I would suggest skipping it entirely.
»Story«
The story of SAO, from what I've been told, is very reminiscent of the .hack series in the sense that both deal with characters playing an MMORPG that traps them inside. In SAO, you are not allowed to leave unless you are killed, which then results in death in real life... or so they say.
The goal of SAO is this: Clear 100 floors, slay all the bosses, and
                  clear Sword Art Online without dying. The story itself seems interesting... at first. The first episode does a good job of telling you what the show is about and what you -should- expect. Sadly, it falls short immediately after the first episode.
The entire point of SAO, the game, is neglected all throughout the show after the third or so episode. By about five episodes in, no longer is it an MMO of life or death, but a generic romance tale, complete with the idea of falling madly in love with a person to the point of threatening suicide, even though you know nothing about them. Not only this, but the ""game"" aspect of SAO disappears more and more as time goes on, becoming more of a side note than anything else. In addition to the plot lacking in general, time skips cause the pacing to be thrown off entirely.
»Art«
The art in Sword Art Online is remarkable. From every episode I watched, I enjoyed looking at it. It goes without saying that SAO is visually pleasing. Possibly even too visually pleasing as the amount of fanservice in the anime really ties down the stunning visuals that it has. All in all, though, the art is the high point of the show. The detailing is crisp, the colors vibrant and beautiful, the animation fluid and consistent.
»Sound«
In addition to the art, SAO shines with its sound. The music in SAO is very well made, and well executed. Each song's use fits the situation and each song sounds great. Even I, someone not fond of high-pitched Japanese vocals, cannot disagree that the opening is well done.
As for the voice acting, I know very little of the Japanese cast as I watch anime in dub when available, unless it's ear-retching and I'm forced to watch in a language I don't understand. The English cast is rather good. Nothing really to complain about as each character does their job and sounds how you would imagine them too.
»Characters«
The characters of Sword Art Online are... not good, to say the least. I'm only going to cover the main two as this review is already long enough.
Kirito: Kirito is bland and without personality. He changes from friendly solo player to a sort of dark hero to a husband all in the matter of a few episodes. He has nothing truly making him stand out aside from his powers. For whatever reason, Kirito is able to beat everything with ease and throw all logic and reason that the show had out the window. If you have played an MMORPG, you know that playing solo means you will lose loads of benefits from playing in a party, and yet Kirito somehow manages to outlevel everyone by a ridiculous margin without struggle, alone. In addition, Kirito is the only player ever allowed to dual-wield, somehow managed to learn how to hack the game (which he could have easily used to free himself, but doesn't), and even ignores the game's premise that states you die for real if you die in the game.
Asuna: Asuna starts as a decent well-rounded character and quickly evolves into a flawless marrysue character that ties down any sort of development that she and Kirito could have experienced. Instead of focusing on the game itself, she and Kirito decide to play house, complete with their own version of a child. Asuna becomes the damsel in distress instead of growing to be a powerful female character like the Major of Ghost in the Shell, wasting all potential she had.
»Enjoyment«
Sword Art Online was an anime I was stoked for. I even waited for my girlfriend to lay back and watch it with me. The two of us were eager to see this ""awesome, new anime"" as it premiered on Toonami. Sadly, after the third episode, we realized just how bad the series was. Ignoring the plot the series established in episode one, disregarding the rules of the game, creating characters that have nothing to really add to the development full of ridiculous gamebreaking powers, etc. I really wanted to enjoy SAO, and at first I did. But by episode five, I realized just how wasted the potential of the series was. This quickly became my biggest disappointment in anime.
Overall Rating: 3/10",3

                ********** SPOILER FREE *****************
Sword Art Online is such a controversial anime that it made me take my review virginity. I am a guy that would gladly participate in this madness of a conflict, mostly because of the thrill and the art of persuasion. As a newly recruited soldier, I will now even the negative reviews with a positive one. I will go into everything and follow the guidelines. Hopefully, make it as clean and spoiler-free as possible.
Concept (10)
The series which is often referred to as ""SAO"" has all the elements required for an ideal VMMORPG. Gamers that prefer this kind of genre would fall deeply
                  in love with its mechanics and playstyles. I honestly got entranced myself. The virtual game concept is not only engulfing for gamers, but certainly for people that failed their progression in the real world as well. I would go as far as to say that this type of console could be an alternative to dangerous drugs. They could experience a new start with new possibilities in an etheric world. The show's concept could easily blind the viewers from all the other aspects needed for a good anime.
Story (5)
The first episodes had a solid foundation for the rest to be layed upon. The fantasy setting of Aincrad has been shown and captured by our eyes. An ideal protagonist that we all could understand why to follow. An antagonist who wanted the game to become more than just a game. And the atmosphere created from the shocking truth. Now that it's no fun and game, you could call it human survival. The prologue emphasizes the reason why we all sit behind a screen. Competence, relatedness, and autonomy are all big factors that state our enjoyment. Kirigaya Kazuto, the main character, gets this realization and runs off on his new beginning with adrenalin pumping inside him. Everything was, in other words, set to become very interesting. But it fails to take responsibility when we sink our teeth in. The magical, horror-filled air fades away and everything becomes plain. The story drops its essence as trash with unlogical fillers. It was like watching my car rolling down the hill into a tree. They time skipped away so much gold that king Midas himself would be suicidal.
The second arc disregards everything that has happened during the first arc. Instead of filling the first arc with all the missing pieces, the anime jumps into a new, unnecessary, bad continuation of the game trap. (Minor spoiler alert) The acts of authority aren't from healthy minds when the new game Alfheim is allowed to use the old Aincrad server. To be direct, the second story shits on the only, short lasted charm the first story had: survival. Unoriginality consumes it and the final product is the analogy: prince in shining armor saving the princess.
Characters (5)
Kirigaya Kazuto (Kirito) - the main protagonist in the series. In the beginning, he was an inspiring lead to follow. His actions are reasonable as he is kind, generous and understanding. Simultaneously acting upon his survival instincts in the game, he helps others who need it. Kirito also has flaws like every other person- afraid about acceptance for instance.  The flaws are a bit few though, as it makes it less realistic. It becomes too good to be true. Along the way, you will know he doesn't spark anymore. If you are a gamer, you will notice things that are absolutely unacceptable. 
The main antagonist. He takes virtual gaming to another level. He is the creator of SAO and programs the game so that nobody can log off until it's completed. His reason for this is to make the experience more meaningful. The antagonist is a composed guy who has the mentality of a gamer. He also seems to be power-hungry. But like everything else within the characters, it will turn out badly. You will begin to scratch your head when you go through his development. 
The second main antagonist. In the second arc you will be met with this douchebag. He obviously does his role when you feel disgusted by just looking at him. He is a psychopath, pervert, abusive and a lying piece of shit. Lying to the degree of Sean Murray. He has a different goal than the other. The problem here is his ending. You won't feel like it was a satisfying execution. When presenting such a character you demand the equal amount of justice.
Yuuki Asuna  (Asuna)- the female lead. She is a tough girl who is professional at the game. She can take good care of herself and known through Aincrad for being the top idol. But when she gets to know Kirito, everything evolves into sexism. Everything she represent withers and becomes uncharacteristic. Requests from fans make it fanfictional and ruins the little personality she has. She also has schizophrenia which is not explained. 
Kirigaya Suguha - Kirito's sister. She seem more human-like than any of the others. She has good spirit and very conversive with others. Even though she can be aggressive toward people that annoy her, she can be gentle and delicate. The dumb thing is that there is another reason Kirito has her as family, which was pretty self-explanatory considering the interactions.
The support characters aren't very notable. It goes to show what most of these are for. I'm not really a fan of harem as the content of it is usually stereotypes with a slutty touch. There are frequent times where I facepalm by how they act around Kirito. This just contributes to my statement about the genre. It's superficial and defies logic. The characters are as disappointing as the story. Figure Yui out for yourself, since I would consider her a spoiler. I am actually happy that I can't describe her when she made me cringe several times throughout the anime. A character that shouldn't be there at all.
Art (9)
The art is astonishing. It lets you immerse in strong, beautiful colors as it portrays a perfect wonderland. Character design is top-notch as well. The bosses and minions are well-drawn and animated, but could maybe be a little more creative in my opinion. All in all extraordinary sight for the eyes.
Music (10)
The music was pretty fu*king fantastic. It couldn't be more on point! Yuki Kajiura is truly a genius composer.  She expressed the scenes to the max extent with harmonious tones. Every soundtrack was medicine to my ears. You get the feeling of a true MMORPG about knights and dragons just by listening to it. The sound tells the setting and atmosphere as if it wouldn't need a script. There are few anime that can achieve it. Crossing Fields are one of my all-time favorite vocal themes because of the motivating melody. 
Enjoyment (9)
Even though crucial aspects were mediocre, the consolation for not having the nervegear in real life was to display it in SAO. It gave me so much joy. So much that I almost ignored everything else. It felt like a visual simulator. It's purpose was to give me a taste of what's to come in the future. 
Overall (8)
SAO is not for everyone, but I can't see why its either hated or loved. People coming solely for solid substance, bla bla bla, good character development, bla bla bla, don't belong here. You need to take everything into consideration. Overall 8 as the average score. Some scores compensates greatly for the others. The series could have been a shining gem, but the developers burrowed it in the mud. You need to look around and find things- which have greater value- for the anime to be satisfying. It saddens me even today that A-1 threw away so much potential. I recommend it to people who wants to have a visual and musical experience. If you discard your narrow mindedness you will probably see a bright side like I did. SAO is actually why I started to watch Japanese anime. Because of their unique concepts and depictions, it made me drop live-action. Technology is advancing so fast that hopefully one day I can join this ecstatic sensation. Anyways, thanks for the view!",8
"
                The show is polarizing for a reason. It takes a specific mindset coming in the show to really enjoy Sword Art Online.
If you are new to anime, then you might find SAO entertaining but somewhat disjointed. If you are a jaded veteran, you might be seriously annoyed by its huge flaws and its perhaps undeserved popularity.
But if you are beyond jaded and cynical about cynicism, than maybe there's a small chance that you will experience the show as I did: a beautiful requiem of simpler times when the good and the brave discover themselves and triumph against great odds. It is a story of passion
                  and love and friendship and all that cliched stuff that eventually comes full circle to once again mean something real and concrete.
Give it a try. Stop if you hate it. But for those of us to whom it speaks, SAO is a glorious celebration of life and an experience that I will not forget.",8

                (Before reading please take into account that this is my first time writing a review and that i tried my hardest) 
(There are some spoilers, sorry) 
Sword Art Online... 
I regret to inform you as awful.. 
STORY: 5
I LOVED the SAO until episode 12 or so. SAO had the potential to be one of the best animes i have ever seen though it fell very short of my expectations. The anime was already way to rushed to begin with and made me believe was only going to be a 12 episode anime, though it didn't do that at all, it ended up being a 25
                  episode anime that seemed extremely rushed because it was trying to put to many ideas into one season. 
I must say that the concept of the Virtual Reality Game was amazing! It left me dreaming for days after watching the first few episodes. Who would not like to be in a VRMMORPG??? It looks amazing! (except for the dictatorship and the harsh rules of the game...) But that story line had awesome potential but was completely destroyed when episode 13 happened. The story became almost like those shouju animes, i love soujo animes i wont lie to you and say that i hate them, but in this story this is not what i was expecting or wanting to happen. The anime should have continued to be action packed and with a slight romance that would blossem, but instead it was quick action a lot of talk, and then even worse when his sister shows up after SAO. ALfhiem Online though was the part that really just ticked me off towards the entire next part of the anime, suddenly they could fly and where like magical fairies in a Disney movie. It could be considered amazing by some because suddenly there is a splash of fan service and huge boobs, more than before. ALfhiem Online was the failure part of the anime, if it hadn't been for that this anime could be considered very good and i would recommend it with the same enthusiasm as i was when it first began to air. 
ART:9 
One thing that i know that SAO did amazing though was art, it was beautiful landscapes, characters, and creatures. Everything was filled with vivid colors that brought out the Video Game from the anime. I loved looking at the background and the characters, because personally i highly prefer this type of anime style than others that seem to be quite popular. Though to me it did seem to have a bit of a childish, not the childish of ""card capture sakura"" but still had that less ""Vampire knight"" more sharp and pointed look. 
SOUND: 7
The over all sound of the anime was good, I cant complain there are songs from this anime that i know by heart after listening to it so many times, but it still isn't the best anime sound i have ever heard. Though once again i must say that ALfhiem Online seemed to just pose a huge problem for me, i hated the music to the second part of the anime, if it could have stayed like the first i would have loved all the music of the anime. 
CHARACTER: 4 
This was another very large flaw in the anime SAO, besides the main characters the other ones just seemed to come and go, perhaps this is because they rushed the entire anime but they still could have kept the characters for longer periods of time instead of using them to help Kirito or Asuna complete a ""mission"" and then disappear fro most of the rest of the anime. The characters barely had any time to grow and Kirito and Asuna even though they had a lot of time to grow i dont really like how they grew... In ALfhiem Online Asuna just seemed stupid; (let me explain my thinking) Asuna instad of being the strong and independent leader she had been for 12 episodes was now as weak as a butterfly and needed someone to come save her, she had been as strong as Kirtio and that is what i think helped save the romance, the fact that both where strong enough to protect each other. But suddenly Asuna completely and feels the need to become that cute little girl that we all thought she wasn't just made her seem boring, as if she had lost her spice, her magic. And well Kirito... Was just kinda all around lucky. He was the only one to be able to unlock a special skill, the one to get the hot girl, and the one to win. It was obvious that he was going to be the winner of SAO that i knew from the begging but they still could have tried to make it a bit more of a chalenge for him. He ends up getting everything and is considered the strongest player in SAO, he just seemed a bit too perfect fo the game. 
ENJOYMENT: 6 
I gave enjoyment a 6 because if it wasn't for the second game ALfhiem Online this anime would be in my top 5. It is a light hearted anime that is fun to watch, but if you are expecting a hard-core video game battle or sexy hot moments this just isn't what SAO has. But it is fun to watch. 
OVERALL: 6 
SAO deserves at least a 6 for overall because it had the potential to be very good, it just seemed to have kind-of half-a**ed it. If they hadn't been in such a rush to finish the anime it could have been very good, and if they could have perhaps stuck to one type instead (i will explain what i mean, just wait). SAO has some parts that seem almost ecchi but still it isn't ecchi, and it could have been a full on action anime but it didn't reach that epicness that you try and find in an action anime. If they had stuck to one of those it could have been better because they seemed that they where just being like ""Here a little bit for everyone!"". They could have made the romance much more romantic too but the way the romance was staged it is kind of a stretch to say that this is a good romance anime. 
I still really liked SAO i am not trying to discourage any one who is planing on watching it, but i am just saying it could have been better and i wish that they could have changed some of their mistakes.",6
"
                This is my first actual review on MAL, so here goes.
Contrary to the most helpful reviews, I found the first half of the series to be wonderful. There's criticism of the time skips, but I thought they worked. 
Though the concept sounds plot heavy this is a CHARACTER driven story first and foremost. Because we follow Kirito, we see most things from his perspective. It's okay that certain characters don't get a lot of screen time, when they normally would if this was a plot driven story. Rather than see a continuous story with no skips, I feel like the skipping submerged us in the
                  somewhat chaotic nature of the setting and plot, and in this case worked for the better. It definitely raises the stakes for the ongoing plot, and adds to the dramatic tension.
If the second half of the anime was as good as the first half, this anime would be a homerun for me. Most of the first half's focus was on the MC's developing relationship with a girl player. They're both skilled fighters, work well together and their characters had good chemistry. Their relationship developed naturally. Their scenes together were heartfelt and moving. They were extremely sweet to watch.
The second half of the season is where my problem is. Everything I loved about the anime vanished for the second story arc. The girl is demoted to a victim and prisoner. It felt like I was watching a completely different anime with the second story arc. And I didn't like it. But I still liked the two main characters and their relationship a lot.
My biggest problem was the 2nd arc's main villain and his treatment of girl. Anytime he's on screen he's basically molesting her, and there is WAY too much screen time to every single time he touches her without her consent and he says and implies disturbing things. It was extremely violating to watch, and if you're sensitive to that kind of content I advise you to skip this anime. 
I really liked the first half. Enough that I'll probably rewatch it one day. But I absolutely never ever want to watch the second half again. It was that disturbing, and the fact that such content was contained in an anime that wasn't even rated R is beyond me. It took me two days to even realize just how much the second half of the anime negatively affected me.
Tread carefully. I fully recommend the first story arc, but I will never recommend the second one.",8
"
                Absolutely LOVED this one! Made me very happy. Lots of emotional moments and balances out with the badass combat moments and ugh. It was just so good. The art work was billiant. Animations  were all good looking. Sounds were crisp. All the characters were lively and showed emotion. I enjoyed watching it and am glad to be a fan.
              ",10
"
                OK this is the big one. 
Every once and a while a anime comes along that completely divides the fan base. On one side there are the people who love said anime unconditionally, and then there are the others that hate this anime with a fiery burning passion. In the 2012 anime season, this anime was Sword Art Online.  
Before I get started, I am going to need to through up a SPOILER WARNING. There are some story elements that I am going to talk about, and one might consider some of these said story elements spoilers.  
Story
The first three episodes are, by
                  far, the best episodes in the anime. It introduces the entire story very well, and I really liked how they dealt with the finality of death in these said episodes. Its a damn shame that it is immediately followed up by what amounts to filler. I don't care that it was just following the light novels; besides the merchant that we are introduced to in the beginning of the anime, we never see the characters that are introduced in these episodes outside of their own respective arcs. Now, these filler episodes do really mess up the the pacing of the story, but the honor of throwing a monkey wrench into the the entire story goes to episode 14. In this episode(SPOILER WARNING) the entire story of people being trapped a Virtual reality  MMO ends, and it comes out of nowhere. From this point the entire anime goes down into a downward spiral of mediocrity, that is better to just watch than to read some guy on the internet write about. 
4/10 
Characters
Our main protagonist is Kirito, a power gamer who prefers to play Sword Art Online solo; there really isn't much else to say about him besides that. No need to beat around the bush so here we go; Kirito is nothing but a wish fulfillment character. I think someone at A-1 Pictures must have realized that most of the people that watch anime are also avid gamers, and most likely have played a MMO at some point. Everything just seems to go Kiritos' way, he completely over powers everybody that he encounters. He solos most of the content in SAO, something that never happens in any MMO. He can pull of feats of strength that are considered impossible by the set limitations of the game, and are we given any kind of reason as to why he can do all these awesome things? No, he can do what he wants because he is Kirito bitch. He even manages to get his own harem by the end of the anime, and it includes the generic loli, cat girl, and his cousin(No, I am not exaggerating). Kirito also has next to no character development. The only character development he does receive in episode three, and all he turns into is the generic, ""I will protect everybody,"" shonen character.
 There really isn't much to say about side characters either, there are only two worth noting. One is Asuna, who seems like she might be a somewhat important character, but just turns out to be a generic tsundere, and even gets demoted to a plot device in the latter half of the show. The other side character of note is Leafa, who Kirito meets in the second half of the show. Not much to say about her either; in all honesty, her main purpose was for fan-service and to guide Kirito through the second half of the show. 
Also, special shout out to Sugou Nobuyuki, the antagonist in the latter half of SAO, who was one of the most generic villains I have seen in years. So much so in fact, that he became some what of a parody of himself, and bumped the enjoyment level for this anime up a few points. 
3/10  
Art
A-1 Pictures knocked it out of the park with this one. The art work is beautiful, and the animation is great. Honestly, one of the main reasons I made it through this anime was because of how well the fight scenes were animated. 
9/10
Sound
Yuki Kajiura did the sound track for SAO, and while it is not one of her best works, it's still Yuki Kajiura. SAO has two openings and endings, and the only one worth mentioning in the first opening. It's not that the opening is really anything special, but the song just kind of grew on me, and I never skipped it.
8/10
Final Verdict: 5/10
Sword Art Online was extremely disappointing, and I think this has something to do with how hyped this show was. To give an idea of exactly how hyped up it was I will give a example, it was on this websites top 100 list BEFORE IT AIRED. So to say that expectations where high is a bit of a understatement. 
I will admit that the first half of the anime was not bad by any stretch of the imagination; in fact, it was slightly above average. But, the bad pacing and the horrible second half, kind of ruined it. 
The only reason I would recommend SAO to  anybody is the animation, and the second half of SAO. Not because it's good mind you, but because it is so hilariously bad that I had decent amount of fun watching it. 
Sword Art Online is available in it's entirety on Crunchy Roll for free. At the time of this review there is no DVD or Blu-Ray release yet, but with how crazy popular this anime is, I imagine that there will be a release buy the end of the year.
Well that was my first review and I hope that whoever is reading this found it at least some what helpful.",5
"
                Reading or watching an adaptation of something, whether it be a book or a film, it can sometimes influence your views on the adaptation. I know it's a bad thing (well, for me anyways) and I always try to see the adaptation as a separate entity; an extension, if you will. And it works for some anime, but not this one. This review isn't a ""Oh the light novel is so much better"" one, because after watching a few episodes of this anime, I realise that they're not actually that different from each other (story-wise, of course)
First off, the plot. As most people have mentioned,
                  it's nothing special. The thing that draws me in the most in this anime is its premise. ""Trapped"" in a game world, they try to survive this ""death game"" whilst clearing the floors. Along the way, some unique stories unfold. I say unique, because they're situated in a game world. I'll try not to drone on about the story and other aspects of the anime, because the main reason I made this review is about something else.
Art and Sound was pretty good in my opinion. It was of decent quality as a product anime of 2012. No particular comments I'd like to make about them. if you're like me, I don't particularly judge an anime solely in its Art/Sound. it plays a minor role, but it's usually the characters that really makes an anime enjoyable for me.
Which is what this anime lacks in particularly.
It's not that I don't like the characters per se, but it's more of their reactions to the situations the anime present.
First off the bat is the first episode, where the game's creator announces that the online game is now a ""death game"". People panic, blah blah, and utter chaos ensues.
What I don 't get is, why though?
As a gamer, I play games to ""escape reality"". Not because I'm particularly unhappy, but just generally unsatisfied with it. Most people (that I have met and conversed with in numerous MMOs) play for the exact reason. To escape our current reality, where everything is dull and boring and nothing about you fits in to it, much like Kirito in the first episode implied. So what I don't get is, why, especially Kirito, is so unhappy with these turn of events? I would have expected that this would have excited him the most, being an avid gamer and all. I don't think he's a ""recreational"" gamer either, and the story implies that he's pretty hardcore when it comes to gaming. And yet, he's the first one to call ""bullshit"" on it all. Instead of Kirito looking agitated at the end of that first episode, I thought it would have made more sense if he was smiling instead. Not because he's a psycho who wants to die (which, I don't get either because you can die anytime in real life as well...) but because of the aspect of living a game as real life.
Might seem annoying if that's the kind of character we're plastered with, but it's the most realistic approach to it. Also, it gives room to the most important aspect of characters: development. Honestly, I see no room for character development in Kirito, and after reading the first light novel, I saw none whatsoever.
Another is the anime's contradictory nature in regards to valuing human lives. I must warn you, there might be some minor spoilers ahead, but I'll try to minimise the damage.
If you've read the light novel, you'd know that Kirito has a ""certain skill"" he can use that pretty much raises his already overpowered skill level, to a whole freaking dimension. And yet, he hesitated in using it in saving a persons life. it's not until one of them actually dies, that he starts to use it, whilst reminiscing the events of (I think) episode 2. Herein lies the contradiction.
After the events of episode 2, you would think that the trauma of it all would be the one hindering him in saving their lives. But no, its because of the prospect of letting out his ""super secret skill"". Which is just idiotic in my opinion; people are dying for heaven's sake. He of all people should know that. And yet he hesitated. Is keeping that skill secret so much more important than saving a person's life?
Anyways, focusing on other characters. The one whom I really liked as a character is Asuna, but for some reason, she gets the least respect in the anime from other characters, and it looks like from the author as well.
And by respect I don't mean idolization, she gets a lot of that. No, I mean respect as a woman. As a person.
It's like her opinions doesn't matter at all, made evident in episode's 7 and 8. Made most evident at the end of episode 8, where
[SPOILERS]
Heathcliff, the leader of Asuna's guild the K.O.B. challenges Kirito on a duel for Asuna. Which is just bloody ridiculous. Was it not Asuna who freaking suggested to party with Kirito in the first place? Was it not Asuna who WANTED to leave the guild for a while to spend time with Kirito? And yet she gets put aside and the men gets to do the decision making? The frak? Kirito wasn't ""stealing"" Asuna for crying out loud. I don't get it at all. Its like the author can't make up a soild idea on how to make a confrontation with Kirito and Heathcliff, and just opted for that. Of course, it could be that Heathcliff's real motive is to get Kirito to join the guiild if he loses, but how can Asuna and Kirito just agree to it all?
Despite my current gripes with the characters and their responses to the situations the anime presents to them, I still find the anime mildly enjoyable, hence overall, I give it a 7.",7
"
                I came into this anime prepared to hate it. All the reviews I saw online, especially on MAL, ranged between 'terrible' to 'satisfactory'. I thought Sword Art Online was just an overhyped compilation of bullshit, that I would end up forcing myself through each episode. And because of this, I cast a critical eye on every episode early on, refusing to accept its strengths and only focussing on its failures. Because of this, it took me several episodes until I realized that by criticizing every episode, I was stopping myself from recognizing the charm of this anime.
It was only after this that I began appreciating
                  this anime.
Unlike most people, I won't claim that SAO is the messiah for all anime; because it's not perfect, not even close. But on the other hand, I won't place it below Queen's Blade; everyone who does that is overreacting to the extremely large and devoted fan base this anime has.
Sword Art Online can be broadly divided into two arcs: the first, Sword Art Online Arc, which is quite impressive, and the largely terrible second arc, Alfheim Online. In fact, the thought and quality put into these arcs are so vastly different, that I'm going to review them separately.
Sword Art Online
This arc comprises of the first fourteen episodes of the first season, and are the main - if not only - reason I like this show.
Story
In the not too distant future, on a sunny summer day, the first Virtual MMORPG releases: Sword Art Online, a game that contains a fully interactive world. It's the first to use the revolutionary NerveGear, which allows you to control your projection in the virtual world using your mind. Effectively, you are being transported to the world of Sword Art Online. 
Kazuto 'Kirito' Kirigaya is a former beta tester of Sword Art Online, and he's confident when he goes in, confident enough to help the newbie Kelin. But everything turns for the worse when they realize that the 'Log Out' option is no longer available, trapping them within the world of Sword Art Online.
It isn't long before the mastermind behind SAO, Kayaba Akihiko, shows up, declaring that their lives in the real world and their lives in Sword Art Online are linked. If they die in SAO, they die in the real world. And only if all 100 floors of the Ainclad castle are cleared, are the people released from this nightmare.
It's a simple, common premise. Our gaming otaku hero is trapped within a game himself. He has to fight, with the power of love from his friends, to overcome the greatest evil and save everyone around him. We've seen it all before, but something is more attractive about Sword Art Online. Maybe it's the death penalty that makes this anime take itself more seriously than its predecessors.
Characters
Yeah, well, I'm not too fond of the characters of Sword Art Online myself. That's because, despite their impressive screen time, most characters feel underdeveloped. Kirito, for example. Even to the end, he feels too perfect for his own good. He's always caring for others, always spouting out beautifully crafted philosophical lines, always sacrificing for others, always standing up for the downtrodden. Above all, he's a chick magnet. Even in the first episode, he seems to know way too much about the working of Sword Art Online and the NerveGear, which made him feel like more of an automatic answering machine than a real person. (This knowledge is explained in the second arc, when they say he's been obsessed with machines since he was small.)
Our primary heroine, and one of the many young women who fall in love with Kirito, is Asuna Yuuki. She's the prettiest girl in all of Japan, or at least the prettiest gaming girl, which represents like 10% of all girls. At the beginning she's displayed as shadowy and independent, before going a complete character turnaround by the end of the same episode that she's introduced. Once again, the next time we see her, she's strong-willed, but it isn't long before she becomes Kirito's personal cook, with the price of getting to eat half the food she makes. Despite all this, she's quite likeable, even as her obsession with Kirito escalates to the point that they get married and leave in the middle of the game to camp off in the middle of the woods to get time together. Yes, you read that correctly.
Kayaba Akihiko is an intriguing villain character. In a way, I can relate to him; to see people duke it out in a death match in a world of your own making is thrilling in a way. No, don't make that face. From gladiators to the Hunger Games, mankind has always been excited by battles that involve unfair odds. Even to the end, I liked him more than most characters who are introduced.
Other characters include Klein, who becomes more and more powerful as time goes on, all the Knights of the Blood Order, that blacksmith guy, and, uhhh, yeah.
Pretty much every female character who is introduced has a brief romance affair with Kirito, and realize within one day that they want to bear Kirito's babies and live with him for the rest of his life. Okay fine, I forgive Lisbeth. But Silica? A small loli? And they even try to get some fanservice out of her. Not to mention that tentacle scene. At first I thought that was the tentacle scene everyone was talking about, but it turns out that SAO has more than one. 
Besides that, the creators of Sword Art Online seem to think that ten minutes is enough time to bond with a character. In around half the episodes, we see characters introduced at the 5 minute mark die by the 15 minute mark, and we are forced to bear witness to the various grievings of Kirito and....everyone else, while we feel nothing at all. Cuz ten minutes man. We ain't gonna cry for some guy we met ten minutes ago. 
KEEP THEM ALIVE FOR SOME MORE TIME
Presentation
This is where Sword Art Online really shines. Ask anyone. The animation quality in this show is just fantastic. I can't even guess how much money they used on this baby. For those of you who must know, it's the same people who animated Anohana, and I loved the animation in that show. From the scenic backdrops to the details on the sword to some fantastic action sequences, everything visual about this anime is meticulously taken care of. Fight sequences are smooth and great looking, and most of all, generally fast paced. This is obviously helped by the fact that all characters use swords, and heck, swords are awesome weapons (second only to scythes, which Soul Eater made me love).
Every character who is given attention is distinct and easily recognizable, with the common habit of everyone having different hair colours.
The setting is varied, but medieval. You'll see knights in armour and brick walls all over the place, and it looks beautiful.
Above just the animation is the beautiful music. This anime has one of the best OSTs I've ever had the luck to listen to. I mean, I just LOVE the music of this anime. It can range from peaceful (like the forest) to dramatic and enthralling, especially the music during battle. 
Overall
It would've been sooooo much better if Sword Art Online ended here. Ignoring the fact that everything until now probably sounded pretty negative, this arc is one of the best game-reality mixes that I've seen. Add the medieval setting to that with a main character with dual swords, and you have a winner. For anyone looking for a good action anime with romance, look no further.
On the downside, there are a bit too many romances, and all of them except Kirito and Asuna's feel fake. Besides the fact that most of their relationship development takes place off-screen (over the span of 2 years), I felt some episodes were oversaturated with the love factor. Characters were underdeveloped, and the director seemed to assume we'd grow attached to them a lot more quickly than we actually do.
Despite it's faults, I recommend Sword Art Online to anyone in search of some good plain fun. This anime is all about that: a dish of fun, with some seriousness sprinkled on top. Prepared by Asuna of course. A warning though; the ending to the arc is pretty disappointing, but satisfying nonetheless.
Alfheim Online
Okay, an important note here. When I go into rage mode, I don't control my spoilerific dialogue. So in case, you haven't watched the show, a shit load of spoilers for the second arc follow.
I swear, if only they had ended it at the fourteenth episode. I didn't mind the ending that much, and most people wouldn't either, unless they were looking for faults. This anime would've been so much better without Alfheim. Why do I say that? Because this arc insults everything that I loved about Sword Art Online.
As usual, with my rage writing, I'm not gonna divide this, and it's gonna be filled with sarcasm.
In the aftermath of the SAO incident, with Kirito returning alive, he now starts a romance with his sister. This sister, who manages to serve a purpose but still feels like she exists for fanservice, kept her feeling under control until she finds out that Kirito isn't her real brother. Which of course, is the perfect reason to fall completely in love with him. Just like everyone else.
But Kirito doesn't care for her in a KissXSis way, much to her chagrin. He only thinks of her as little Sugu, his darling younger sister. And he still cares for the beautiful and tragic Asuna, who never woke up from SAO and is still in a coma.
Meanwhile, Kirito meets Asuna everyday, staring at her on her hospital bed, and often running into her poor father. On one of these days, Yuuki-san reveals his plans to marry his comatose daughter to a pedophilic rapist that he considers to be his son. All without her permission of course. This pedo-guy is the main villain of this arc, as you might have guessed, and is so pathetic I can't even remember his name even though I finished the show today. 
It turns out that pedo-guy is in charge of a new virtual reality game called Alfheim Online. Yes. For some reason, despite the fact that 9,400 people died during the SAO fiasco and another 300 haven't woken up, nobody bothered to ban virtual reality games and headsets. And because of this, pedo-man decides to abuse his power and conduct experiments on players in his game to stimulate emotions to manipulate people. And there's a dirty American company that's interested in this information.
Unlike Akihiko, pedo-man is not intellectually stimulating at all. I can't relate to him in any way. In fact, the only way I can elate to him is that we're both males. That's pretty much it. Besides that, he has a creepy, sleazy voice in Japanese, which changes to high-pitched wailing when he's hurt. THE MOST annoying voice possible, perhaps even eclipsing Emperor Pilaf. Not to mention that he spends almost three-fourths of his screen time feeling Asuna's body.
Anyways, back with the story. It turns out, as he reveals while sniffing Asuna's hair, that he trapped Asuna inside Alfheim online so she can't wake up and reject the marriage. And her dumbass father doesn't have any clue what's going on. He also reveals his wish to do her both inside the game and in real life when she's in comatose state, which sounds downright necrophiliac to me.
In order to save her, Kirito decides to enter Alfheim. If you thought there were problems before, oh boy, you are in for a TREAT. He meets his busty cousin, Suguha, in the form of Leafa. Granted, Sugu looks different in the game; however, she can't recognize her own brother despite the fact that the only thing that changed about him was his hairstyle. And his pointy ears.
That's another thing. If you want to see all of your favourite SAO characters turn itno weird looking elves, well this anime's got you covered.
So Kirito magically gets his stats from SAO because they're using the same server, making him so ridiculously overpowered that he's the strongest player on the planet the moment he starts out. Because of this, there's no need to waste time training since he can basically beat everyone he meets. More time for Leafa and her chest then! The fanservice in this second arc is mind blowing, from the various leaders of factions developing a crush on Kirito within moments of meeting him and trying to seduce him with sex appeal. God damn.
Anyways, Kirito blows through his opponents because he's Kirito, and the power of love and friendship is always stronger than actual power. It's only towards the end that he uses help, and that's after coming farther than an entire squad got. And this backup comes equipped with weapons bought from his vast stores of money that he generously gave to the aforementioned leaders. Leaving him broke, of course, but he's Kirito so it doesn't matter.
Meanwhile, Asuna is also in elf form. Her main purpose in this arc is to sit inside an actual bird cage, and wait for pedo-necro-man to come and feel her body. The one time she actually escapes, she gets caught when she's feeling happy. By two slugs. With tentacles. You know where this is going. There's and uncomfortably long purple tentacle scene, with them wrapping around her waist, thighs....you get the idea. Then she's sent back.
At long last, Kirito and Leafa realize that they're acutally brother and sister. Leafa reveals that she fell in love with Kirito to forget about Kazuto, but since they're the same guy, epic fail. But they reconcile while ballerina dancing in the air (you'll see what I mean) and with her help and the assistance of those two leaders, Kirito breaks into the cage and saves Asuna before getting caught by pedo-man.
The following fight is disgusting and forgettable. As a game master, pedo-man increases gravity till Kirito and Asuna can't move. Then he proceeds to strip Asuna of her clothes, drinking the tears ff her skin as she cries and licking her face. As he moves down to her legs, Kirito is reminded that he has the power of love and somehow replaces pedo-man as the administrator, leading to an extremely one-sided and stupid fight. But the actual ending of the show is good. Kind of.
Overall
If it was just Sword Art Online, this show would've got somewhere between an 8 and an 8.5. But the presence of Alfheim Online degrades it. A lot. And hopefully you understood that from the part above.",7
"
                Well, first of all i think SAO is the best anime i ever watched. It's story maybe not unpredictable but it covered great scenario and graphics. Specially battle scenes was amazing. And we just saw only two episodes. 
Maybe you don't like this anime but there is one think you must accept. Musics!
This show has one of the most epic musics in ""my anime world"" and i'm sure many people will agree with me.
Characters were also great. They' re very mysterious and tight. 
When All these factors come together, They emerges this amazing anime.",9
"
                I realize that reviewing SAO is something that's akin to stirring the hornet's nest.  Many SAO fans will defend this anime like one of their kids is being tortured in front of their eyes.
They vehemently defend that SAO is one of the best anime of all time, and even the slightest bit of criticism one makes of SAO is met with hostility.  
I perfectly understand that SAO is a very popular anime, but popularity isn't an accurate gauge to judge if a show is good or bad or worth watching.
The fact remains that SAO has numerous problems, and it manages to take a
                  concept which had so much potential to be deep, but it disregards potential plot points in favor of harem and romance.
--The Story--
In SAO, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, so much so that the virtual reality MMORPG, SAO is a highly anticipated release.  With the NerveGear, players can control their in-game avatars with nothing more than a thought.  So basically it's like the Matrix.  Kirito and 10,000 other players soon find out that they are trapped within the game, and in order to be released, they have to beat the final boss.  If they die in the game, they die in real life.
Such a plot has so much potential to explore ethical dilemmas, the state of humanity, political plot points, and such, but SAO quickly disregards such lofty and deep plot points in favor of romance and harem.  Very quickly the main plot point is put on the back burner in favor of turning Kirito into a Gary Stu.
Got a problem?  Kirito will solve it with conveniently acquired skills and abilities, and he will get all of the women in the end, adding to his virtual harem.
This kind of Deus-Ex Machina hand-waving is what makes the plot horrifically bad, and frequent plot points are brought up then quickly ignored or hand-waved, or explained by Ass Pulls.
Inconsistencies within your own fictional canon can be forgiven if it happens once or twice, but if they happen regularly, it quickly reveals itself as a absent minded plot.
--Art--
Having said my piece on the ""plot"" of SAO, I should point out that there is one good thing about this anime, the art is actually pretty good.  The animation is overall pretty good, and the characters are designed well artistically.
However, the quality of the art quickly drops off during the last few episodes, where action sequences are still shots for like 3 frames, and then almost stuttery animation.
--Characters--
The characters of this anime only compound the problems with this anime.  Kirito is basically a nothing protagonist otaku and Gary Stu, able to solve any problem with Deus Ex Machina gained abilities, and he has poorly written lines that try to come off as deep and thoughtful, but end up very bland and boring.
SAO goes out of its way to tell you that Kirito is the manliest of all men, who's able to swoon the ladies by rescuing them.  I can understand that a woman might fall for her savior, as that's a plot point in many a show, but it happens every episode.  So much so that each episode is a game of ""Guess Which Girl Develops Feelings for Kirito?""
It's not the fact that Kirito always wins, that's not the issue, it's the fact that we're shown he's only a good fighter because he uses brute strength, and nothing more.  Implausible fencing powers?  Check.  OP for no other reason?  Check.  Gary Stu?  Check.
Frequently in Kirito's fight scenes, he shows nothing other than brute strength.  No strategy, no practical thought, never takes advantage of other's abilities or insight.  
While it may seem that I'm bashing on the Attack! Attack! Attack! trope, I'm not, as there's a manga I love that has a main character with implausible fencing powers, and fights with brute strength.  That's Berserk.  However, unlike Berserk, Kirito shows he's a one trick pony, fighting with nothing but swords and bashing at a boss till their health depletes.  Unlike Kirito, Guts shows tactical strategy, ingenuity, and willing to use anything within his power to gain an advantage in a fight.  Kirito is as far removed from this as it's possible to be, and what's more, Kirito shows no redeeming character qualities.
Mind you, he's not a villain, he's just not relatable at all, at least in my eyes.  He shows no intelligence, no insight, and we're given no information about Kirito at all, unlike with Berserk, where full chapters are devoted to Guts' personality and backstory, and his redeeming character qualities.
Asuna is even worse.  I wish there was more things for me to criticize about Asuna, but she shows even less personality than Kirito, other than being a textbook Tsundere.
There is one character that I liked, who I think was intelligent, showed good writing, and had redeeming character qualities, and he showed himself to be the most competent character in the whole anime.  And that's Agil.  He treats the game as a death game, and sets up shop because he knows that eventually someone will clear the final boss, and since the bosses don't respawn at all in SAO, you can hide in the safe zones and wait it out.
Agil shows himself to be more competent than anyone else in the entire damn anime.  But one character is not enough to save the anime.
Suffice to say I found nothing redeeming about this anime aside from the art and the supporting character Agil.
Overall, I'd say this was one of the worst anime I've seen in a good long while, but is it the worst anime I've seen?  No.  School Days and Mars of Destruction have more problems, but SAO is one of the worst anime I've seen.
Overall, it gets 1/10 from me.  Mostly because the plot is nothing but a light romance and harem that happens to take place within a virtual reality video game, in lieu of great potential plot points SAO could have touched base on.
There's better anime out there that are more worth your time.",1

                [Adapted From Original Blog Post]
I don't think it's a stretch to say that Sword Art Online was one of the most over-hyped anime of the past few years. Now, admittedly, I'm not sure if I'm in the right position to say that, I only officially entered this fandom in between when Sword Art Online had finished airing and everyone was freaking out because Attack on Titan was the ""best anime ever"", but due to the hype-train of that series, I think I have an idea what people were acting like as Sword Art Online was announced and started airing its first few episodes. And trust
                  me, I don't blame anybody for getting excited, I mean, the series looked cool on paper, I don't expect anybody to have anticipated the bullshit that was to come in the next 24 weeks. But now that the hype-train has long derailed, and most of the haters of the series have finally calmed down and moved on to hating something else(*couchaldnoah.zerocough*) and the opinion of the show has more or less solidified in the community, I thought now was the time to finally give my opinion of the highly criticized and hated anime: Sword Art Online.
     So, hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, and to celebrate my return from hiatus(sorry about that but serious crap has been happening in my life recently), I thought I'd review something that people might actually care about. So, buckle in for my review of Sword Art Online. Let's begin.
So, just in case you have never heard of this show(which is very unlikely but whatever), let me give you give you the basic rundown. Sword Art Online is a 25 episode anime TV series based off the light novels by Reki Kawahara that aired in between July 8th to December 23rd of 2012, and as previously mentioned, attracted a lot of hype when it first came out(due to a certain premise which drew in a certain demographic, but I'll talk about that later), which of course meant it received an enormous amount of back-lash from critics and haters alike during its latter half and after it had finished, some of this criticism justified and some not.
     SAO was brought to us by those lovely folks at A1 Pictures, who have brought plenty of crap and good stuff over the years. They have plenty of stuff I like: Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day, Shinsekai Yori, Nanana's Buried Treasure, Your Lie In April, and Saekono for example. But then again, on the other hand they have crap like Aldnoah.zero,  Gunslinger Stratos, and well... Sword Art Online It was directed by Tomohiko Itou, who has done lots of storyboards and miscellaneous jobs for many great and well known anime(Death Note, Monster and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time), but as for actual directing jobs, Sword Art Online and its sequel remain one of his solitary works. And that... is quite evident, as it turns out, but he did Gin No Saji as well.. so, that's something. The writer was Alex Van David, who mostly has done ADR direction for a variety of shows, but also handled the script partly on shows like Madoka Magica and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, which kind of boggles my mind actually, because he did something as crap as this... okay, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.
It's the year 2022, and virtual-reality video-games have finally become attainable by the use of technology, allowing players to actually jump into the virtual world and control their in game avatars as if they were their own bodies. In this new genre, the world is eagerly awaiting the release of the virtual reality MMORG: Sword Art Online, a game designed by genius programmer Kayaba Akihito that promises full immersion into a fantasy world of swords, dungeons, monsters and adventure. And on November 6th, 2022 Sword Art Online goes live to the public, and the 10,000 lucky people who were able to get one of the first copies log into the game to find an experience that surpasses even their wildest dreams: a fully functioning fantasy world where anything is possible. It's a wonderful day for everyone, but for no one more than our main character Kirito, a reclusive 14yr old teenager who has always used video-games to escape his bleak life, and being able to nearly disappear into a whole other reality is pretty much equivalent to a wish come true for him. Though maybe he shouldn't have wished for it too hard...
      After the initial euphoria, the players of Sword Art Online discover what they assume to be a launch-day glitch, as the button to log out of the game appears to be missing from their menus. Nothing to worry about of course, the programmers will sort it out soon, but still, it's rather worrying, because as it stands, with their real-life bodies currently paralyzed by the technology that allowed them to jump into the virtual world in the first place: Nervgear, there is currently no way for Kirito and the rest of the 10,000 players to log out of Sword Art Online. But suddenly, SAO's creator Kayaba Akihito appears before them, and tells them that this is in fact not a glitch, but rather a ""feature"" of the game. That this is an intended aspect of the game. And now, with their real-life bodies frozen and their consciousnesses completely cut off from the outside world, Kayaba informs the players that there is now only one way to escape the game: clear all 100 levels of Aincrad, the floating castle in which the world of SAO resides in, and make it to the final floor to defeat the final boss in order to return to the real world. And if that didn't sound impossible enough, Kayaba tells the players that there is one more aspect of the game that he conveniently forgot to leave off the box: that the moment that the player's HP reaches 0, the Nervgear on the heads of their real-life bodies will activate, and do to their brains what a microwave does to an egg. In other words, in a brand new near impossible virtual reality fantasy game that nobody really knows how to play, they need to clear it, and if any of the 10,000 players die in the game along the way, they die for real. Good luck.
Now I know what you're thinking: ""that sounds freakin' awesome."" And yes, yes it does, the premise is likely the reason SAO was so popular before it had even aired its first episode, and why it kept that popularity: by attracting a whole new demographic of gamers to anime, gamers which not only were biased right away because of the subject matter, but also since Sword Art Online is a rather excellent gate-way anime. That's because for all the faults I'm about to list off in the upcoming paragraphs, SAO is at the best of times a very fun anime. Exploring the aspects of the virtual world is fascinating, particular when it comes down to the boss battles that Kirito and the rest of the players have to face at the end of each floor, which ignite a sense of excitement due to the great animation, and also a sense of nostaglia for that kid inside you who loved those kind of things so much. It's similar to anime like Guilty Crown in that way I suppose; if you ignore the flaws and watch strictly for entertainment purposes, Sword Art Online is easy to watch and easy to like. That's not my problem with it. My problem is that if you look past the ""fun-factor"", and look at the story and characters... well, I wouldn't say it's a travesty, but... well yeah, it's a travesty.
It's actually amazing how many things Sword Art Online does wrong. Oh, it opens well enough, the first two episodes introduce the world and get you excited for what's to come. The delivery of the revelation about the true nature of the game by Kayaba Akihito is well done, and the second episode makes the stakes of the game quite real by fast-forwarding a month into the game and revealing that 2,000 people have already died. The first and second episodes also introduce the supporting cast well, by introducing Kirito's comic-relief friend Klein by mixing it with exposition, and the love interest: Asuna, who makes a bad-ass first impression by being cold with everyone, really being good at the game despite being a complete newcomer to virtual-reality MMORPGs, and slashing the sh*t out of the game's first boss with Kirito in an awesome and wonderfully animated sequence that made me think, ""hey, I'll think I'll like this girl."" But here come the problems, and my, there is a long line of them. 
After episode 2, and especially after episode 3, the pacing takes a dramatic change, as Sword Art Online changes from focusing on the charge to beat the bosses and clear the game, to Kirito messing around in the lower floors of Sword Art Online with a bunch of boring, pointless, and freakin' terrible side-stories. Every episode, we see Kirito happen some random girl, and solve her problems due to how incredibly over-powered he is compared to everyone else(more on that later), and then said girl will usually fall in love with Kirito for no explainable reason, which makes the whole thing ever harder to take seriously. See, SAO wants to be a tense story of survival in an unknown virtual world, but by switching the focus from actually trying to clear the game to ""random adventures with Kirito and co."", all that tension dissipates as quickly as the first two episodes built it up, especially when paired with how easily Kirito solves most of the issues of these episodes. It doesn't help that any character we meet during this span is completely and utterly one-dimensional and practically irrelevant to the rest of the story, and yes, they're all just stereotypes to help building Kirito's harem, though one wonders why we need a harem in the first place in your fantasy action series when we already have a romantic subplot. What's the point of giving these characters an episode and feelings for Kirito if they won't do anything substantial in the story again ever?! *sigh*. I would say that you could just cut episodes 3-7 from the story and be done with it, but that's not quite true. Episode 3 is actually not that bad. It's not well written, but the consequences of the end of this episode actually almost make you feel like Sword Art Online is a game you can actually die in, where death is always just around the corner and how hard losing somebody is, not just a backdrop of the setting forgotten in all the fluff. And episode 5, for how pointless it is, does provide some building of the chemistry between our two main characters, but that is nearly inconsequential in the avalanche of issues with these episodes. 
     For once, this truly appalling structure of the series is not the fault of Reki Kawahara, but rather the way that A1 Pictures chose to adapt his light novels. See, the original SAO light novel told the ""Aincrad arc"" beginning to end, while the second novel of the series is a collection of side stories about what happened in between the many time-skips of the story, and it's these side stories, for the most part, that encompass episodes 3-7. I can see the reason why they chose to adapt it this way, but come on, did anyone see that this means that we literally forgot about the story for 5 episodes?! And seeing that the ""Aincrad Arc"" is only 14 episodes long, 12 if you leave out the introduction, that means that you've rendered nearly half of your show completely separated from building on the narrative. That's...not a good idea, guys. 
Fortunately for my patience, the problems aren't over yet. Once the plot does finally decide to stick its head out, it's still flawed as all hell. It's hard to care about characters you don't have any attachment to and feel invincible, and that makes the drama and stakes the second half of the anime tries to raise feel laughable, and once deus ex machina logic is introduced for the sake of a happy ending, suspicion of disbelief is destroyed. The biggest shame about all of this is that, with only a couple of changes, I may have been able to like this series beyond just simple entertainment. If the plot had been more focused on the charge up all 100 floors of Aincrad, I feel it would have improved the story significantly. We would have had a clear goal, Kirito and Asuna would have been able to build their relationship steadily, and whatever game mechanics that A1 Pictures wanted to show off could have been discovered as the players worked their way through the game discovering new things. But nothing that could made this story work is focused on. Instead of the raw, exciting and tense charge through the game and boss battles, we get inconsequential side-stories that have nothing to do with anything. Instead of interesting game mechanics that would make this virtual world come alive, Sword Art Online game's fundamental design doesn't even make that much sense on a variety of ""game-play"" aspects. Instead of focusing on the politics and culture of 10,000 people suddenly trapped in a video-game and how that effects their moral compasses, we get Kirito strutting around foraging for bullsh*t. And that pains me deeply. But not as much as this next part. 
Now, throughout this review, you might have noticed that I've talked about the ""Aincrad Arc"" and how it was 14 episodes even though the anime is 25. That's because the anime Sword Art Online is actually divided into two parts: The ""Aincrad Arc"" which takes place in the SAO game, and the second arc, ""Fairy Dance."" Now, I can't say too much about this arc because of spoilers, but it's bad. Unbelievably bad, and to be frank, I'd say just stop watching on episode 14 of the anime and move on to the second season, because I don't have enough time to say everything that is wrong with episodes 15-25. If you do insist with watching it, have a little fun and don't think too hard, and you'll be sufficiently entertained. However, as much as I tell people to absolutely watch the first half of Sword Art Online for entertainment purposes despite how bad it is at times, there's nothing I can say to defend the second half. Watch it, don't watch it, it's up to you. I just wish that we could have stayed in the ""Aincrad Arc"" for all 25 episodes and ironed out the problems, for something that maybe could have been really good. 
The one thing I will give Sword Art Online credit for contextually is that is actually manages to end all right. Deus ex machina aside, the ending of both arcs are rather satisfying, especially the first, which not only pulled a twist that was surprising, actually well built up, and kind of cool, but also provided the only interesting thematic and character element the show had to offer, and it's a pretty damn good one, I just wish it wasn't surrounded by all this crap. Reki Kawahara obviously had a goal in mind, but he really lacks the skill as a writer to bring anything interesting to the table. And if you think I'm going a little hard on Reki Kawahara and not hard enough on the people who actually brought this story from a novel to an anime, give me some time. I'll explain everything, and by then, I think you'll understand the problem at the heart of SAO. 
But before that, we need to talk about characters, and since nobody else really matters besides Kirito and Asuna, let's just discuss them, shall we? Our lead first.
     I'll get right into it, Kirito is possibly one of the blandest and boring protagonists I have come across. He's established as a socially reclusive teenager, but that trait disappears the moment it's introduced. He's supposedly some sort of bad-ass with a dark side, but he's actually has the same ""nice-guy"" personality as any bland rom/com protagonist out there. ""So,"" you might ask, ""what exactly is Kirito's role in the narrative then?"" Well, I'll tell you. Quite simply, Kirito is whatever the plot needs him to be. It's the reason he's stronger than everyone else in the game, Kawahara admitted in interviews that he wanted to write SAO's story to be about one of the stronger players in the game, but since he undoubtedly has no idea how players become strong in MMORGs, Kirito inherits the trait for no reason. His actions contradict themselves to serve the plot so much that it becomes and harder to think of him as a character rather than just a plot device, and you know what, by the time he is breaking the very laws of the virtual world he lives in for no reason other than ""because he's Kirito"", I'm beginning to think that is exactly what he is. He's a solution for every problem that comes up in the story, and when your main character is only that, well... you've failed.
     Asuna, on the other hand, fairs better. As a fighter, she's a bad-ass, and as a character, she's mostly just a tsundere, but actually has reasons for it, which is appreciated. And while she is undoubtedly one of the strongest players in the game, she can't do impossible things like Kirito can(well, for the most part). But what's kind of inexcusable is how the story itself treats Asuna. She's established as a bad-ass in the first two episodes, but as the story goes on, her roles in events become more and more minuscule compared to Kirito as she relies on him. Now, it could be argued that this is because of her growing relationship with Kirito(which is decently handled for the most part), because after all, with love comes dependence. But it's not as simple as that. By the end of the Aincrad arc"", Asuna literally can't do anything without Kirito's help, despite her status as a player, despite logic, she suddenly becomes helpless at the most crucial of times, and it's always up to Kirito to swoop in and save everyone. And that pisses me off. But that's nothing compared to her role in the second half of the anime, or to be more precise, how she literally turns into a plot-device. Oh, I don't feel like ranting about that right now. ""Fairy Dance"" is crap, let's move on.
     While he only appears for a grand total of like, 10 minutes in the entire show, I still find Kayaba Akihito to be by far the most interesting and well developed character in the show. Obviously, I can't talk about his reasoning for trapping 10,000 people in a game and getting many of them killed, but I'd like to say that unlike many people, I don't believe it's a cop-out. I find it rather fascinating, actually, which leads him to be one of my favorite villains(believe it or not), and the whole reason I'm continuing to read the SAO light novels is pretty much  because I hope that he'll turn up again and we can get some proper back-story. 
     So, with all these problems, surely there is a silver lining to it all? Well, never fear, for A1 Pictures rose from their throne of completely unrelated anime series and lack of identity to proclaimed: ""hey, look at these pretty colors.""
Sword Art Online is probably the best looking show I've seen from studio A1 Pictures, with the possible exception of Anohana. The animation is superb, with vibrant colors and truly gorgeous backgrounds that really bring the whole world to life. I like the variety of settings too, that come with the many floors of Aincrad, from a snowy wasteland to a floor completely covered in flowers, Sword Art Online looks amazing whatever way you look at it. The three boss battles we get to see are the peak of animation however, as what the action of the anime lacks in choreography, it makes up for in pure animation power, so even if the movements of the characters during battles are very simple, the animation alone makes it exciting and fun. But not all the action is bad in terms of choreography however. There is one particular duel during the latter half on the ""Aincrad arc"" that is my personal favorite in the show, and hell there's even one in the ""Fairy Dance"" arc that is rather epic, as much as it hurts me to admit that part of the anime exists. 
     Yuki Kajiura is a name I hope you're familiar with, because she is one of the best composers in the industry today. Sure, her music is samey occasionally(okay, a lot), however, the music she has produced for Sword Art Online is still well above average. It's not her best by any means, that honor is still held in the hands of Madoka Magica in my opinion, but this soundtrack is still great to listen to in the midst of an action scene, if not by itself. OP's and ED's are pretty good too, the first opening: ""Crossing Fields"" is exciting and catchy, while I consider the second ED: ""Overfly"" an actually quite beautiful song that takes on a whole new meaning once you know the lyrics. Above average in the music department, ultimately.  
So, who do I blame for Sword Art Online completely tarnishing it's potential, ultimately becoming an anime that is entertaining but not good? Well, I blame A1 Pictures for their poor choices in adapting the light novels. I blame Tomohiko Itou for not having the foresight to stop these issues and take full control of creative license to craft Sword Art Online into the good anime that it could have been. But most of all, I blame Reki Kawahara. See, this is why Sword Art Online is the way it is. The original light novel was written by Kawahara when he was 15 as a submission for a contest, but ultimately never submitted the story due to him going over the word limit, and ultimately launched the story online where it gained its popularity and turned into a light novel series, and eventually an anime. The reason SAO skips around in time so much, and why the ending of the first arc is so sudden is because Kawahara must have realized he was approaching the word limit for the contest and had to end it quickly. The reason why Kirito is so inexplicably over-powered and the game does not make sense on a fundamental level is because Kawahara wanted to write a story about a high-level player, but did not the research real MMORGs to see how people become strong, or how these games actually work. The reason all the other female characters in the show fall for Kirito is because Kawahara has openly said in interviews that he doesn't know how to write female characters any other way. The reason why Kawahara hasn't fixed plot-holes and contrivances in the story that he himself has admitted, is because he clearly doesn't have motivation or respect for his work as long as it makes money. The reason why SAO seems like a 15yr old's wish fulfillment fantasy about how he is the most bad-ass player in the entire world and gets all of the girls... is because that is exactly what it is. 
     But hey, even if they're stupid, at least fantasies are fun to watch, and even more important, they're harmless. So maybe I'm being a little hard on Kawahara, after all, I've never even met the guy. At least I'm not angry at Sword Art Online getting popular, like I am with something that insults my very pride as an anime fan like Valvrave. I'm not offended by it. It's a fun, stupid show, that got popular because of the demographic it attracted, the luck that came with the mindset of that demographic, and the comfortable cliches it nestles itself in, and got a huge backlash and negative connotation in the community because of that very popularity. And that's all. So go watch it. It'll be fun. 
Final Verdict: 5/10

                    SAO was a brilliantly made anime that includes many twist and turns throughout. It knows just how to trigger almost every emotion. When you watch SAO you are almost immediately connected to the characters and the story.
    There are times in the story were you get mad, sad, happy, and inspired. The story never gets old and has a surprise practically around every corner. 
    The 2 main characters are Kirito and Asuna who are the two most kick butt characters I have ever seen. These characters to me felt like true people not just
                  characters in a show.
    The quality of the show was great and the art was phenomenal. Colors were vibrant and details were excellent. I was amazed by how great the gaming community was portrayed in this show.
    I would recommend this for anybody who likes anime in general. I thought it was great and I am sure you all will too. Thanks for reading... hope you enjoy SAO!!!",10

                SAO, the most controversial anime on this side of the galaxy.  A flawed writing (very flawed at times) built on traditional archetypes, but executed quite well, enough to make it one of the most popular anime of all time.  Love it or hate it, it's a show that will at the very least be remembered for a long time to come.  If you simply want a ""watch or don't watch"", you wont find it here, but I shall do my best to give you an idea if you might enjoy it.  On to the breakdown, shall we?
Story - Story writing is
                  the second weakest portion of SAO.  SAO was first created as a web novel by Reki Kawahara for a contest when he was still quite amateur, and it shows.  The pacing, while I understand its necessity (showing every single floor would be tedious and get stale), was a bit all over the place and many of the main characters lacked real development.  Side stories were clearly filled in after-the-fact and the main arcs are standard tropes or varying takes on them.  That being said, it was enough to be compelling.  The original premise to the story is quite interesting in and of itself, not only being trapped in a game, but being able to *die* in it.  It really is a great setup for tension, and the first arc did a decent job making use of it.  The Sachi episode especially, while short, was enough to tug at your heartstrings and provide context to Kirito's actions.  There were some actually unexpected plot twists in the story which kept it fresh between arcs, and while there were a couple deus ex machina moments, a lot of the plot had at least a sense of cohesiveness and flow.  The story doesn't win any points for originality, but it provided enjoyment, made me think a bit, and never left me bored, which to me is all that really matters in the end.  A little above average.
Characters - Characters in SAO are a bit all over the place.  Some are compelling, like Asuna, others are what many like to refer to as ""Gary Stu"", like Kirito.  Some like Argo *seem* quite curious, but are never expanded upon.  Kayaba is quite an interesting antagonist that remains a mystery, whereas Sugou is a very standard and simple ""exists-to-hate"" villain (could have had a handlebar moustache!).  They are written well enough that they are pleasing and you are slightly invested, but none are really developed enough that you truly want to know *more* about them beyond just seeing them win.  Reki learns his lessen in the next Season, but for SAO I, the characters imo are just simply interesting, but not special.  Slightly above average.  Asuna/Kayaba stood out as varied individuals, but were surrounded by a sea of mediocrity.
Art - The animation for SAO is really, really good.  It's what I've come to expect from A1's best team.  It isn't perfect and has its flaws, but the fight scenes are just beautiful and the colours vivid.  The backdrops were absolutely breathtaking to see and really gave the feel of this grand MMO story and richness to it that many shows lack.  Not to mention providing many a beautiful desktop wallpaper!  The characters were emotive and distinctive, and the enemies wondrous.  The animation really allowed you to immerse yourself in the show, rather than distract the viewer, which is what quality animation *should* do.
Sound - Yuki Kajiura.  Really, that should be enough said.  The SAO music is really, really well done in my opinion, it's the best part of the show!  The score is great and the opening songs are some of my favourites and mp3 player worthy; just all around quality tracks as one would come to expect from Kajiura.  The music in this show is actually quite reminiscent of her work with Fate/Zero, but that's a good thing!  It always fits the atmosphere well and ratchets up the heroism or tension or tenderness depending on the moment.  Honestly, do yourself a favour and pick up the OSTs and buy Crossing Field on iTunes or whatever your music player of choice is.
Enjoyment - Really, this is what watching anime is all about I believe.  And for SAO?  It passes with flying colours.  I can't quite give it a 10, as the story could have been more compelling, but regardless, I always wanted to see what was going to happen next!  I always enjoyed the fights accompanied by bombastic symphonies and the emotional moments with tender strings, I enjoyed seeing Asuna develop as the show went on, and I enjoyed the twists and turns in the story and the emotional roller-coaster it put me through.  As I said earlier, the story/characters may be flawed, but the show executed with all its heart.
So, the big question you want to know if you're reading this: is SAO worth watching?  As I originally said, I can't answer this for you; however, I do think it is good enough that most viewers could find something in it to enjoy and it's worth a try to see yourself if you enjoy it.  It isn't as popular as it is for no reason, and even if you acknowledge its flaws, you have to give credit for its execution.  At the very least it is worth watching to know what all the fuss is about!",8

                The bad reviews, I mostly agree with them. Just some comments here. The incest/cousin thing was hilarious so the second half wasn't completely without it's merit. I read somewhere that the creator made porn of his characters. I think the guy meant it as something separate from the anime. So maybe that is out there if you like, but I laughed at this comment as well because this guy would. Then in the end it was totally in the anime itself. It kind of happens again in the wrap up to the first arc of the second season, but it's not as bad. You kind
                  of get the feeling the writer wants to be Kirito. 
I think there is some consensus about the shows decline with the introduction of Yui and I agree with this. That doesn't go away either, Asana walks into the hospital room in season 2 with ""hot nurse"" and she has Yui on her cell phone yapping momma and pappa.. really? Won't hot nurse at least give you shit for that? Hot nurse let us down.
Everybody is giving shit to Mario in these reviews. Lot's of Mario hate that I don't understand. One of them that I nodded along with a smile in agreement with ended on the note that it was misogynistic. Girl in cage made for terrible plot, I will give you that all day. I just don't see the misogyny, the shit you are talking about is just bad plot. A misogynist is a person who hates or doesn't trust women. The show doesn't even come close to meeting that charge.
I like the first arc of season 2, I don't really plan on finishing the season though it looks to be so dull. Shinnon wasn't a bad character at all. Of course you will be right when the arc ends and she joins the harem, and that itself is kind of funny. I'm not a hundred percent on what counts, but it probably does. All the characters are in the harem though, the bartender, Klein, the glasses guy, all are in the harem. Kirito has options. 
I'm surprised my review was read by as many as 40 people. 30% of you didn't tell me to go suck ass so I'm grateful for that. The quality of my review is surely terrible, I was not trying to be thorough there are plenty of those already written quite nicely. I can't be sure completely what the feedback is in response to, but I'd guess the mario and the misogyny. I did introduce that topic with a redundant sentence that I'm not editing out. There are more than a few reviews harping on the mario trope though. It's black and white thinking about these things that is the problem. The show really is not misogynistic, it just isn't. Poor plot riddled with cliches, absolutely. 
I'm not a critic, I enjoyed the show for the most part. When I was done, I enjoyed a good laugh reading the reviews because everything they said was so true. It does  completely go downhill at points though so I think 5 is more than fair. For example, guess what? Asuna's mother is against her relationship with Kirito. That cliche is totally unwatchable. The ALO stuff was horrendous. Though Kirito's charm resulted in unintentional comedy there at expense of the plot. Everything else in ALO aside from the porn was forgettable.
There is some questionable stuff in the anime, it is just very shallow thinking to label it sexist. I need more of you to dislike my review : ) I don't think I spoilered anything vague references and stuff that was referenced spoils itself in the anime. That is, you will know immediately what is going on once it is even hinted at. You will only watch it to see exactly how they go about the ridiculous romance. Creepy villain in ALO too there is no suspense, you are watching a train wreck. It kind of takes you out of the story though.",5
"
                I'm French, and it's my first review, so i will keep it simple :
For me, after watching the first episode, SAO was a future"" must watch"", and now, i'm just disappointed... 
The story, could have been so much better, it was first a deadly game, with a cruel fate for his contenders, but it slowy became something else, something too fluffy...
The music of SAO is just oustanding, one of the good point
Art/AnimationI have nothing to say, some fight were boring, for example, Kirito vs Salamenders, but others fight like Kirito vs Eugene were just amazing, so, it compensates. But overall, it's fair
The character : For
                  me, there is just too many of them, and some were just unexploited. Klein, Agil... Lisbeth and Silica... And Sugu : Why the fuck in the episode 23, she's completely devasted, and in the next episode, just like  "" Meh ! Nothing happened "" ?! If you start something, finish it properly dammit... 
Enjoyment : Altough there's really a huge potential wasted, I've rather enjoyed the serie, and it's due to that amazing concept...
Overall :
SAO is an anime that i would recommend, but there is really too much wasted things...",6

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! 
I wrote this review to show you my opinions on SAO series and opinions of people who disliked and hated to watch anime. I know that it's have some flaws and things that made people who watched anime drop it out,but to me,Sword Art Online is one of greatest anime i ever watched,i re-watched it countless times because it's had something that i love and i prefer in anime. I noticed some flaws after reading negative reviews,it's kinda opened my eyes,but like i said,it's had something that made me like it very much that i don't care how bad is it.
                  I am going to show you my and hater's opinions. This is not only review for this anime,but also for SAO 2 and Ordinal Scale.
Story - Me:7/10    Ones who disliked it:  1-4/10
Honestly,some have different opinions because they read original work,light novels which is anime based on. Let's say that you rate anime 4/10,but when you read light novels,you change opinion that anime is maybe kinda 7/10 or even 2/10 because they made mistakes and that light novels are better than anime. Some say that story is bad because after 2 episodes,anime gotten bad because of 'unnecessary' and 'generic' chapters and moments and because of what happened is Fairy Dance arc,that story where is heroine is treated like quest item and almost got raped and there is some almost incest with Suguha and Kirito and other things and bad stuff in SAO 2,Oridinal Scale and video games that makes them mediocre or bad. 
My opinion:
I did not pay much attention to story's flaws and plot,i started to watch anime because i like romance anime and action anime  with sword fights and romantic moments and kissing scenes and because i wanted to know what kind of anime is and what kind of romantic moments with Kirito and Asuna were like because some said they are one of best anime couples. I was thrilled about story where you are trapped in video game with cool weapons and badass 'Sword Skills' and romantic story between Kirito and Asuna. I liked that how many players and Kirito and others fought bravely to clear game and when finally Kirito get reunited with Asuna in final episode,it's was so cuteeeeee! It's true that story got flaws,but to me,anime has so many great things that i liked and made me enjoy anime.
To be completely honest,i don't care about anime series's plot at all,only thing i care about it's art,music,Waifus,romance and action
Art - Me: 10/10  Ones who disliked anime: 4-8/10
Some say that animation and art is good and there is nothing to complain about,some say that characters's art looked lazily made and weapons and armors are generic or poorly made.
My opinion:
I love the way anime is animated for and how Asuna and other girls (expect Silica and Lisbeth,i am talking about main girls like Asuna,Leafa,Sinon,Philia from SAO:Hollow Fragment and Yuuki.) are looking cute and beautiful so much that some people want them as waifus. Kirito's art and other character's art are decent so i don't know what to say about them. Weapons are looking so cool,i like Elucidator's art,it's badass to have completely black-colored sword.
Music/Sounds/Voice actors - Me: 10/10   Ones who disliked anime: 5-8/10
Some say that anime got just good music and there is nothing else to talk about and some say that some music and sounds are okay and some are bad.
My opinion:
Sounds are okay,voice actors are famous ones because they provided voice to other popular characters. Music is masterpiece,i love LiSA,she got nice voice and she is amazing while singing Crossing Field,Shirushi,Oath Sign,Rising Hope and ASH and many other songs used in anime. Also other artists did well on opening and ending songs,they were amazing as LiSA.
Characters -  Me: 10/10  Ones who disliked anime: 1-4/10
People are mostly complaining about how characters are generic and annoying and they have bad personality,villains are evil for no reason and sexual and god-complex reasons and that Kirito is over-powered bishie that breaks women's hearts for no reason and he does make everything alright no reason and that Asuna is half-useless tsundere damsel in distress who is treated as quest item and fanservice girl.
My opinion:
Some maybe have point about some characters,but they are COMPLETELY WRONG about Kirito,Asuna,Leafa,Sinon and Yuuki.
Kirito is indeed maybe little over-powered thanks to beta testing and knowledge he have about Sword Art Online and having unique skill and being able to convert his account for easy wins,but over-powered characters are not bad as you think,there are many over-powered anime characters and villains like Goku from Dragonball,Saitama from One Punch Man,Sebastian from Black Butler,Gilgamesh from Fate Stay Night,Father from Fullmetal Alchemist,Alucard from Hellsing and Aizen from Bleach. Some are considered good,some bad because of stupid reasons. It's true that his personality is messed up when it's comes to girls who confess their feelings for Kirito and girls who likes him,but he got heart only for Asuna because he fell in love with her,there is no reason to fall in love,many people fall in love suddenly or at first sight. He broke Liz's and Suguha's heart,but their wounds healed with ease. He can sometimes be a bad to girls and other stuff that some people does not like about him,but i don't care about that and what i care and like about is his fighting spirit,valor and skills in battle. His fight scenes are badass and makes me shiver of excitement. He showed his raging,flaming fighting spirit while fighting SAO bosses,Salamanders,Eugene,GGO players and Death Gun. Also he got villains's asses kicked for being ass*oles and rapists in badass way. He is kinda generic character to haters and people who disliked SAO anime,but his sword fighting skills are equal to Archer's (Fate Stay Night),his fighting spirit and valor is equal to Erza Scarlet's (Fairy Tail) Also i like his love for Asuna,i like how strongly he feels about her,he would fight a last boss to free Asuna,that is true love.
Asuna is not bad character at all,i know that some of you find Asuna's 
mild tsundere talk annoying,and that you dislike when she is sometimes cooking instead of fighting and that she is damsel in distress twice treated like quest item in Fairy Dance arc and Ordinal Scale,but there are so many great things about her. She very cute and so beautiful that she ended up on Most Beautiful Anime Girls lists and also she is great at cooking in games and real life. In Sword Art Online,she was analyzing the tastes of ingredients and items and made real life stuff that is not on SAO,such as soy sauce and mayonnaise and made a delicious food for Kirito. She is maybe not fighting all times,but she is very good swordswoman,she strikes so fast that no enemy can dodge rapier (expect Yuuki) Also she is very useful in battles,no matter how many times there were times where she was not fighting. Asuna is just a normal girl with good looks,good sword fighting skills,she is very good cook and she got a sweet voice and personality, making her one of the most ideal beautiful anime girls,If anyone thinks Asuna is not beautiful, clearly you have no sense of beauty.
Leafa or Suguha if you prefer,she was maybe too sexual because she got a big bust and sexy body and because she is in love with her brother/cousin,but she got over with her feelings and she is useful swordswoman thanks to her kendo skills and she is great supporting character (she is main in Fairy Dance arc) She maybe got flaws,but she is beautiful and cute girl and i like emotional and other moments between her and Kirito. She is not bad character.
Sinon is sometimes liked and sometimes hated because of unknown and stupid reasons,but whatever flaws she got for ones who disliked her,she got none. She is just beautiful and cute girl with tragic past. She started to play Gun Gale Online (GGO) to get ahold of her trauma from PTSD,everytime she touches the gun or sees anything related to guns,she starts to have panic attacks and gets sick. While she was in GGO,she got no panic attack and she was able to use guns normally. While she kept playing GGO,she got used to game and thought if she got stronger in virtual world,she would get strong in real life as well because she wishes to cure her trauma. When she met Kirito,she was becoming more cuter when Kirito embarrass her and after defeating Death Gun,when she hugged Kirito and smiled while grenade was killing them. Also,Kirito helped her to overcome her past and trauma by showing her people whose lives she saved and that instead of thinking what she done,she must think of lives she saved. It's was so emotional to see Sinon cry over child drawing :,( She is very skilled sniper and great archer,also she is way more cuter in SAO:Hollow Fragment. I don't know what flaws you guys are talking about,but Sinon is not bad character at all,she is perfect,ideal girl like Asuna.
Yuuki is also criticized for having 'dramatic backstory' and 'crappy situation'. Just because she lost her almost entire family,her sister and she got serious disease does not mean it's a bad character,for God's sake! She is cute and beautiful girl with faster sword fighting speed than Asuna's or Kirito's,also she is tough swordswoman with awesome Sword Skill called Mother's Rosario and fighting spirit. Also she is very wise girl,she said once to Asuna:'Asuna... Some things cannot be solved with words,they can be only solved with fighting.'
Those words gave Asuna bravery to show her mother her world and her true wishes and purpose. Final episode shocked me,seeing Yuuki dying.... So sad.... Too many feels... She is one of best anime girls ever,anyone who says that Yuuki sucks got no tears and heart. If you watched anime with too many feels and sad moments like Clannad,Plastic Memories and Angel Beats,you should know how it's feels like when your favorite character disappears.
Kirito,even Asuna,Leafa,Sinon and Yuuki have unique personalities,emotional and romantic moments and skills and other great things that made me like them.       THEY.      DO.     NOT.      SUCK.
As for villains,yes,they suck except for Kayaba,who is decent villain.
Kayaba isn't half-bad,his Japanese voice actor is same guy who voiced Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop. Many say he is bad because he forgot reason why he turned SAO into death game,but that's not true. He simply created SAO to fulfill his dream: To escape into floating castle which surpasses all kinds of laws and rules in real world for eternity. He didn't forget reason why he turned SAO into death game,but why did he involve innocent people in order to fulfill his dream. He wanted players to feel same as he did. 
Seeing how some characters gotten used to their daily lives in Aincrad and having fun and happy times even though they are trapped inside game,it's makes sense why Kayaba involved 10.000 players into his world. And that reason was later revealed in Alicization arc: To connect both real and virtual worlds until they are so indistinguishable that no one can tell which one is real. He also wanted something beyond that. He wanted someone to surpass system he created with strong willpower. Asuna managing to take a blow for Kirito by removing paralysis with her desire to protect Kirito? It's surprised him but then seeing Kirito denying his death with willpower and desire to resist system so he could deliver to Kayaba a killing blow same him smile without resisting,taking hit from Kirito. If you are wondering why Kirito was able to resist death and Asuna her paralysis? Incarnation System. If you watched Accel World,you probably know what in Incarnation and how does it work. Also,Incarnation was introduced and explained better in Alicization arc so i recommend you to give SAO a second chance by watching Alicization seasons,where characters and story improved a lot.
Enjoyment - Me: 10/10   Ones who Dislike SAO series: 1-4/10
Because of flaws on story and characters and other stupid that made them dislike anime,critics and haters were not able to enjoy anime as i did.
My opinion:
Sword Art Online is very fun and enjoyable for me to watch because of badass fighting scenes,romantic and emotional moments between Kirito,Asuna,Yui and other characters. I like sword fights,they are so exciting that make me hype and sweat of excitement,my favorite are Kirito and others fighting 100th floor boss in Ordinal Scale movie,Kirito VS Death Gun,Kirito VS Gleam Eyes,Kirito Vs lots of players in Mother's Rosario arc and Kirito fighting Heathcliff on final battle in Aincrad arc. Anime is so enjoyable that i re-watched it so many times. Fight scenes are maybe little too short and kinda bad as you haters think,but they were not,they were enjoyable to me.
Overall - Me: 10/10
Haters:Worst anime ever,1-4/10
Final thoughts:
Like i said,there are so many great stuff in anime that i mentioned,but due flaws that i don't give a f**k about,you dislike it. Problem is that many of you disliked it and criticized it because you focus too much on story and characters and other bad parts instead of things that makes anime enjoyable and fun to watch. I like anime with romance,action,fighting scenes and emotional moments like Sword Art Online,this anime made me realize my taste on anime and what i seek on anime. If anime really sucks,they would not make video games,anime merchandise and Dakimakuras. 'Romance in SAO is cheesy and characters got no chemistry',my ass. 'Fighting scenes suck',my ass. 
Take this:
Sword Art Online is one of greatest anime i ever watched in my entire life (not number 1,but in my 'Best Anime i ever watched list') It's got's everything i love in animes and what i seek on anime and good waifu.
You may say that anime sucks,but i won't let you talk s**t about my waifus!
Keima Katsuragi from The World God Only Knows once said:There is no bad heroine,only bad games!
My saying:There is no bad waifus,only bad anime! If weren't for our waifus anime would suck without them!
Some dislike anime where you are trapped in videogames,some don't like mixed romance anime,some dislike anime with mistaken story,characters and their personality.
If were reading SAO light novel,you would notice mistakes that made in anime that made you dislike anime,i can understand that,but disliking anime based on visual novel,manga or light novel before reading or watching original works because of stupid reasons is wrong unless you did watch or completed original work. I watched some anime based on manga,because of mistakes they made or chapters they skipped,i always prefer manga. Sword Art Online is good anime for haters and critics only if you all focus in good parts on anime only,not bad parts. Link Start!",10

                Well if you don't like my review and chose to down-vote it. Please do tell me why you didn't liked it so I could avoid making crap reviews such as this.
S.A.O (Sword Art Online) being one of the anime that I've watched of it's kind. (I never watched .hack or any other anime that share similarities like S.A.O.) I can tell that I pretty liked the anime, the sole reason is that I watched 10 episodes simultaneously and stopped just to write this anime review.
------------------
There are few things I would like to point out in this fantasy-game anime.
First of all, S.A.O started up being awesome,
                  I agree that the first episode was just upright talking and explaining stuff about S.A.O and the NerveGear and about how you cannot log out until you beat the boss in the 100th floor, and dying in real life if you die in the game as the Nerve-Gear will fry your brain in no-time was just genius. But the problem starts after episode 2 (the boss fight scene). The story was great, it had potential but after episode 2, I just wanted more in the adventure of Kirito and Asuna in they're attempt to defeat the final boss and how they've struggle trying to get stronger and leveling up. But what I got is Kirito lazing off in cities figuring boring stuff, and skipping most of these crucial parts. (To me at least.)
And, I've read reviews on MAL about .hack and I've seen similarities by these two anime, although I can't tell because I've never watched .hack, but I will. :)
The animation was rather good, they're characters that look ugly but this is intentional, there isn't a perfect world with just beautiful ladies and handsome men. 
SAO had a good opening theme song, for myself atleast. Each person has different music genre so I hope I don't get negative comments because of this.
OVERALL, I give S.A.O an overall score of 7. I've read some reviews that it gave S.A.O an overall score of 1 - 2. But I can't blame them, each person has different thoughts and opinions afterall.
Please do watch S.A.O, and figure it out yourself if you liked it. :)
I have still a long way to go, time for more S.A.O!",7

                So I watched this because everyone was all hyped up over it, after I had finished it, my craving for MMORPGs when sky high. This story always kept me on the edge of my seat and I feel so sorry for anyone who watched it week after week. I had to watch it all as quickly as possible because it was that good. Even now I still have the opening songs and OSTs in my head playing! The story was outstanding, the music was amazing, the characters were beautiful and the animation was just legendary! I really need to buy Kirito's swords too!

                The show was overall entertaining for the most part, it has a story which had alot of potential but there was no real execution of the said story. Rather than focusing on the story the plot tends to focus the relationship of the characters and in doing so the story which should the focus of the anime becomes the backdrop of the anime.
the art was great the animation was consistent for the most part, and the portrayal of the world in the anime was beautiful. Characters in the show were for the most part generic and this at times takes away from the entertainment of
                  the show because it makes the show kind of predictable.
Overall i rated the show very well because it was entertaining, leaving out all the negatives i could talk about the show itself to me was entertaining and i always wanted to see more while i was watching the anime. In saying so it is a very entertaining show and i think people should atleast watch the first 3 episodes then decide if this is an anime for you.",8
"
                Sword Art Online, what seems like an awesome series based off the first episode, starts to turn really ... crappy-nicest description I can give. The first few episodes really got me excited, watching an MMORPG game that is a virtual death trap, there are soooooooo many ways how this could have turned out, there could be relations between reality and the game like maybe character structure and the economy, but no it just is like regular fantasy anime. There is literal an ounce of character development, ""Oh, I like you..."" a heroine states and I say ""WHAT? How did that happen?"" 
Generally this show is
                  geared towards kids, small romance, a ""badass"" MC, like lots of people say, no horror, and a simple plot. After the first two episodes there was a time skip, in some animes that does not matter, but when you want to watch a fantasy anime playing on the virtual reality element, you want to watch how characters go through and progress. With 100 floors there could easily be 200-300 episodes going through the content of the game, the structure of the system, what makes this a MMORPG when the players cannot grind with limited resources, and actions scenes. If this anime had lots of episodes and development with little repetition, it could easily be one of the best ones out there, but instead the viewers are left filling in the blanks and speculating if the MC is secretly giving all these girls roses and the admin is leveling Kirito to make his stay at his high level. When I watch this and compare it to Log Horizon, I would say this is still better because the players in Log Horizon have no goal to complete, like most MMORPG, but without that goal the anime is just basically filler until some type of conflict, not man vs. man but like the MCs are trying to save the world but a guy gets in the way type of conflict, appears.
I would like to recommend this anime to those who like the graphics of anime, although this does not have the best or even top-tier artwork, and to those who like simple plot.",5
"
                There are anime that i consider bad and somewhat enjoyable but there comes a time when there is an anime that simply is so stupid that you feel insulted by simply watching it for pure enjoyment, enter Sword Art Online or SAO for short. This is so badly written that ""turning off your brain"" does not help either. I am a long time avid gamer and have experience playing MMOs in general, from early Everquest to World of warcraft and watching this anime that tries to mimic its merits is nothing more than insulting.
Lets begin.....
Story:
The story opens up with the information that a new game
                  named SAO just got released, it is an virtual mmo game that is played by using Nerve gear, which will simulate the events as if you were there, it is connected to your brainwaves that simulate all this. The main character Kirito is one of thousands of players who enters this game. At first everything seems fine until Kirito realizes that the ""logout"" button is not working, then the gamecreator Kayaba Akihiko appears and reveals that everyone in the game is trapped and cannot logout. The only way out is to defeat the game and destroy the final boss, but there is a catch, if you die in this world, you die in real life. It is from this moment that the ""death scenario"" is created and the reason why the series will hook you, at first.
Now you are thinking ""ok, so this sounds interesting so what is wrong with all this?"" well its simple, the story and the episodes that follows after episode 3, does not even focus on this so instead of expanding on the theme of ""death game"" and development of the lore, characters and what more, the series is then nothing more than a side story journey. Episodes 4 and onward to episode 13, does not even attempt to defeat the game or its ""bosses"" and only after half way with episode 13 do we get this theme back but then how it ends will shock you to the core how it all ends. SAO is nothing more than wasted potential in this front. But belive me, it gets worse.
Characters:
Perhaps the worst part of the series, so i will break it down in detail.
Kirito:
Kirito is perhaps one of the worst characters i have seen, he is OP, can do everything by himself despite that the show is all about an social mmo game. He can be whatever the plot wants him to, therefore he is not a character but more of an ""self insert"" type. That means that he can be whatever the plot feels like at the moment. He does something stupid in episode 3 that will haunt him but only after several episodes will it be mentioned. When he breaks down in front of Asuna and tells her about the event, funny, why did he not feel bad about it when it all happened?. Oh yeah, now i remeber, the plot now requires him to remember so he does. He has all the girls, can have a skill that no one in the game can and more. Basicly, he is a wish thinking character that many young boys wants to be and nothing more than that. Kirito is this kind of ""self insert"" character. There is a difference between a powerful character and an OP one. Kirito ruins the entire show becouse of his OP stuff, makes no misstake, wins almost every fight and more. Simply boring as hell character.
Asuna:
The only character that i like in this show, at first, she is this ""badass"" female that is second in command of the Bloodknights guild. That is until she meets Kirito and later starts dating him where her character is wasted. She cant do a thing without her boyfriend and therefore ends up in the background for the rest of this arc and the rest of ALO arc, more on that later. SImply wasted character alltogether, no redeeming qualities about her.
The rest:
Pretty much pointless, they dont matter at all, not in this arc nor in the future in season 2. The only purpose for them is to be ""Kiritos"" leftovers or harem girls as they are called.
ALO Arc:
At episode 15, the next arc starts but it has nothing to do with SAO, it is as if its a new anime alltogether. It just features the same characters, cant talk about it since it may be a spoiler but lets just say that it is ""garbage"" and episode 21 in itself will make you puke. The death game is gone and no penalty is present. Kiritos own cousin Sugha is introduced and she is horrible, cut her out and nothing is lost.
Sound and animation:
The only redeeming quality of this show is its animation and sound, the animation is fluid and the soundtrack adds to the feel of the game and battles, Yuki Kajiura is the composer of the soundtrack and this show does not deserve to have her making the music. While not in her best form, she is still awsome.
Game mechanics:
This is here where the entire show collapses, Kirito gains a dual wield skill that he and ""only"" he can use. Sorry but gaming does not work that way, immagine what would happen if a player have access to a ability in Dota, wow or Starcraft or any game for that matter that no one has access too, it would be a shit storm pretty much. So where is all the magic gone? where is the support classes, everyone in the anime seems to be some kind of melee knight sort of, i am sorry but this kind of game would be pretty boring to play if only the melee was the option.
Also, SAO uses a system it calls ""switching"" but it is not explained how this is benificial especially when there is no healing involved. So what happens if everyone is injured, who to switch to if everyone is close to death?. Log Horizon does a much better job of this, there are roles and that adds to the fights, SAO ignores all that and pretends that you are retarded and stupid and that you would not ask those questions. Even Nerve gear is not that well explained despite that it is a very important plot device in the story.
When people claim that Kirito is a gamer and they want to be like him, sorry to burst your bubbles but gaming in general does not work like that, Kirito is so OP that he almost breaks the game becouse of it.
SAO from different views:
So who is SAO for? is it for gamers, action lovers or romance lovers?, well lets take a look.
Action and MMO progression....
Sorry but there are not many action scenes that are exiting, for several reasons. First, Kirito is OP, this alone ruins everything, having battles with good animation is great but if you can predct it then it becomes pointless. Character progression takes a hit as well, for one reason, ""time skips"" thats right. Kiritos leveling leaps a huge leap between episodes, yes, seeing him grinding would be boring but they could have made it so that while he and Asuna is on the quest to complete the challenges they could have done leveling that way. So sorry, no action, only filler episodes.
Romance part.....
Once again, ""time skips"" stands in the way. The anime tries to tell us that Kirito and Asuna is cute together but fails to tell us how they ended up together, it seems that the writers tells us that relationship is easy, all you have to do is ""point the finger"" and the girl is yours. Sorry but this attempt fails big time. In one episode, they are friends, in the next they are a couple and in the later one, they are married. So if you are a romance fan and wants some more than simply a kiss then you will not find it here.
Conclusion:
SAO is the worst anime writing i have seen in fiction, stupid antagonist, plot holes, time skips, Op Kirito, sidelined and wasted characters, not understanding the MMO genre in general is killing this show. Vast majority of episodes for the first arc is nothing than filler with characters that has nothing to do with the plot nor will they ever be important.
Kirito is a wish character that comes out from a fan fiction withing at its worst, brooding, anti social which is stupid becouse he is pretty good for someone that is anti social, manages to catch the attention of any female in the ass long radius, i wish i  had those ""anti social"" problems. All in all, one of the most overhyped anime that i have seen, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Reki Kawahara the writer of the series is not capable of writing, not the lore nor the characters. If you want to create a anime based upon a MMO, please do some research how MMO works.",4

                I suppose it was only a matter of time before I put in my two cents about Sword Art Online. I started watching it with high hopes, having seen the major hype on this website, Facebook, Tumblr, and hearing about it from my friends. Even the concept seemed like it would be amazing. This held true for the first 2-3 episodes. Too bad the other 22-23 episodes were pretty dreadful.
Story: 2/10
I don't know what the writers were thinking by having pointless filler episodes, followed by massive time-skips. To me, this just made the entire thing sloppy and somewhat confusing at times. On top of that,
                  the story itself was very melodramatic with several plot holes. It began well, as I said, but it really just turned into shipping, shipping, creepy suitors, and more shipping. The incest was really not necessary. Over time, it just turned into a harem.
Art: 10/10
The art is simply gorgeous. I love the style, especially considering how well it fits to the futuristic setting. No complaints here.
Sound: 5/10
Neither opening songs nor closing songs were memorable. It got the job done, and that's about it.
Character: 1/10
If the ball wasn't sufficiently dropped by the story, it was definitely shattered to bits and pieces by the character ""development."" Kirito was absolutely terrible as a main. He was, in all definitions of the term, a Gary Stu. Whenever there was some major problem, he would become the big hero and deus ex machina everyone out of harm's way. He also had one of the nastiest cases of Kirk Syndrome I've seen in awhile (meaning he got the undying affection of pretty much most of the females whom he encountered). Asuna started off as a strong character, but she quickly turned into a damsel-in-distress that can cook: the essential love interest for a well-rounded Gary Stu. Finally, we have Sugu, whose love interest with Kirito/Kirigaya became borderline creepy, confusing, and completely unjustified.
Enjoyment: 3/10
The 2 points keeping this score from a 1 stem from my enjoyment of writing this review, and the first two or three episodes. 
Overall: 3/10
It's saving grace is the art and the enjoyment gained from criticism. I would really not recommend this to anyone, except someone who really enjoys harems. Even then, Eiken is at least funnier.",3

                (wrote this without checking how i spelled, sry!) Short review, if you write a long one, no one will care!
The reason you watch anime is because you want to experince something incredible, you want to see something that are so good that you want to forget everything and then watch it again. Few animes are like this, SaO is nowhere near.
SaO just maked me angry, it is not as bad as the haters say and it's not even close of being as good as the lovers say, it's an almost decent anime. But that's not the point SaO makes me angry, i have never seen
                  anything from any tv-serie, movie or anime that has so much potential. This is one of the few animes that i think really needs a lot of episodes, they should never have left SaO and they shouldn't have time skiped so much as they did. SaO had a really good first episode, then it just jumped out from a cliff and said fuck story and fuck any good character development.
Animation: SaO looked really good, the few action scenes they had was made pretty well and the rest of the show looked more than fine. You can complain about SaO a lot but they had good animation.
Sound: SaO was great at this department too, they had a great soundtrack, and the openings was fairly good, not exelent but not bad. If you just count the animation and sound then SaO is exelent, but we have some more things to mention.
Story: well, this actually happend. They had great animation, sound and the location that the anime took place in was fantastic, but it seems that it's REALLY hard to make a decent story. At first i thought that SaO had a great setting and story (first,second episode) then something happend, the thing that happend was that they skipped a lot. And when i mean a lot i mean a lot. Kirito (main guy) went from being kinda strong to be motherfucking ultra saying in one episode, no sorry not in one episode. between two episode he became super strong. And the main girl Asuna went from being a shy little nobody to be one of the most important persons in the SaO universe, and yes she is a tsundere. The reason why i wont mention the story is because it really has none, it has one goal and it is to beat the game. Nothing more that you can mention, the reason why the story wont get a story is because they have as i said a goal that they follow.
Characters: You can mention three characters in SaO, Kirito the kid who every girl likes for no reason (ofc we got some Harem in SaO) he is also the strongest player in SaO, even if we can't see why he is the strongest because of the fucking time skips. We also got the at first shy girl Asuna that for no reason turns out to be the general or something like that for the strongest guild in SaO, she also for no reason turns out to like Kirito, why? we don't know because of the time skips. Then we got the sister Suguha, or what am i saying, she is just a cousin. The reason why i write just a cousin is because she is in love with Kirito, AGAIN for no reason. Suguha appears when the second arc starts, she is playing the second game that SaO is about, i will call that game, Motherfucking Fairies. The only character development that we have in SaO is that Kirito will choose one girl and Suguha wants to bang her cousin more and more.
Value: The only thing that i can think about is that if you are stuck, don't give up. Fight for your right and try to live. SaO got some Value but it's minimal. More Value than story, even if that's nothing to brag about.
Enjoyment: The music and animation was great and only for that reason i enjoyed it to some degree, and the setting was one of the best that i've seen, i love video games so i had hopes. But they fucked this anime so hard that i almost want to cry.
Final verdict: The first episode or maybe the first two was pretty good, or maybe great. Then the motherfucking ""why must they have"" time skips happen. And the second arcs setting was so much worse than the first arc. If they made 60 episodes or so about SaO (The real SaO not motherfucking fairies) and showed how Kirito leveled up and fought the bosses plus that they had a lot of side characters with character development. Ofcouse the main cast would have been Kirito and Asuna that they would focus on but i wanted side characters to have some spotlight too. And Suguha, she never happend, the only thing that i can see is that she tries to rescue Kirito and goa nd played SaO, but that would have been bad. If they made something like that it may have been a masterpiece, or atleast more that decent. Perhaps very good, but you know, we will never know because i doubt that they will remake SaO into something good!",6
"
                In the future, 10,000 virtual mmorpg players are trapped in ""Sword Art Online"" and the only way to get out is to clear the game.  The premise of the anime is one that every video gamer would squeal at.  But unfortunately, there's not much more I can say about the anime than that.
Upon finishing the SAO anime, I was left utterly confused and wondered: Why is this piece of ____ so popular?  I'd heard much about this series way before the anime was announced, and I thought the anime would be a great chance for me to get into the series. 
                  Alas, I ended up hating most what I saw.  In fact, lurking around forums and talking to my friends, I've ultimately found that people who've watched SAO fall into two groups: Those that mindlessly love SAO and those who hate it without mercy.
Thankfully, I decided to reserve my judgement until after I got a chance to actually read the novels, which is why I've forgiven the series.  The anime itself, however, as a standalone work, still fails to deliver all that was amazing in the novels.
Disclaimer: The following review touches upon what I despise about the anime, with references to the original light novel.
First of all, whoever planned the anime out needs to get slapped in the face.  Hard.  The first episodes were really great, and I really loved them, but then the hated filler arcs arrived. Episodes 1 and 2 set up the anime perfectly, and established our main character, Kirito, and his role as a strong solo player to be feared/respected. Episodes 3 to about 8 takes all that, chews it up, spits it out, and steps all over it.  It was painful to watch and reminiscent of Haruhi's Endless Eight arc.  To be honest, if you want to watch SAO now, I highly recommend that you skip episodes 3-8 because they really add nothing to the story.  Many side characters are introduced only to magically disappear and never return, except some in the last episode.  The producers somehow thought it would be a good idea to jam Volume 2 of SAO (which are ALL RANDOM SHORT STORIES) in between events that occurred in Vol. 1, which completely killed the progression of the story.  Granted, in SAO Vol. 1, there are still a large number of time skips that may leave the reader disoriented, but at least the majority of the story focuses on the main characters, Kirito and Asuna, and their relationship is more believable and less forced.  A lot of much-needed monologue is also missing from the anime, which makes the characters themselves difficult to understand and sympathize with.  In fact, I often felt like I had no idea why characters were doing certain things because they simply weren't represented well.  In the case of Kirito and Asuna's relationship: ""I wub you!"" Me: ""Wait, what?""
Part 2 of the anime progresses much better (and also follows the novels a bit more closely), but again, there is not much monologue, which makes the characters feel empty and insubstantial.  Often, I'll find that characters have sudden changes in disposition without even seeing what led them to that point.  In fact, if I hadn't read the novel, I would still hate a certain blonde-haired elf with a fiery passion, without understanding her inner turmoil.  I wish the anime had done something like Melancholy of Haruhi, where Kyon narrates a lot and we get to hear what he's thinking.  There's no way we can read the minds of anime characters, so why not have them tell us what they're thinking?
With that said, story and character development are the weakest points of the anime, and is truly a huge disappointment.
On a (somewhat) brighter note, I was rather pleased in terms of the graphics and sound effects.  While this doesn't take away from the fact that the story and the characters are a big mess, it was still good.  The characters are crisp and cute, and the music is done by Yuki Kajiura, who has never failed to disappoint me.  I usually skip through the OP/ED songs, but they're surprisingly good and don't kill my ears.
All in all, I would recommend that people who want to get into the SAO series either read the novels (translated somewhere on the net) or watch the anime anyways while skipping a few episodes.  Maybe watch them on a later date, when you're bored.
--Editted for clarification",4
"
                I'm highly disappointed in the amount of bad reviews that this show has managed to accumulate! SAO is a brilliant anime. People are bashing a show that many find brilliant, and I still maintain it is the very best anime of the year! 
Characters: Kirito has no character according to most, but its a split personality he does have and thats something I can relate to a lot, I'm very much divided on how you might see his character, but I take him to be young adult who may be very confused about what to do with himself, much a like me. I find myself
                  confused constantly. 
Asuna yes like Kirito she's a bit confusing, but shes like my sister, too damn good at games, comes from a good family and is blindly in love with what some might call her best friend to be. The characterisation is sort of unbefitting when you get to the Alfheim Arc but otherwise Asuna maintains a headstrong front.
Story: Ah yes, the plot, is it senseless? No! Its your typical good guys v bad guys. It is interesting, enrapturing and I assure you it will pull you in. If I say anymore I'll start spoiling it so....
Art: I need say no more, it's brilliant. 
Audio: All good here, yet again no more to be said.
In summary, don't listen to the doomsayers, its a good anime and if you look at it on the basis of watching before judging completely, I'll assure you now, you won't be as disappointed as these fools rating it a 2/10.",10
"
                SAO has a very nice concept: a virtual reality with limitless possibilities. Admit it: we want a place outside reality where we could do what we want. We sometimes wish that the virtual world becomes our reality. And here is a story about that.
Many players in-game found more meaning and enjoyment in their life inside Aincrad. People inside ALO experienced how it is to fly. Many impossibilities are made possible, thanks to VMMORPGs.
However, the series also shows its disadvantages and possible dangers within (i.e. players unable to logout hence trapping them, and the possibility to forcefully control another person's emotions). Bad people use this to
                  exploit others' weaknesses and used it for their own gain.
The concept may not be very original (I really don't know because it's the first of its kind I watched), but SAO certainly did a good job in portraying its intended message.
And that's why I'm giving this series a good ol' 9. Although others did not like ALO arc or the series as a whole, I have no reason to hate either arcs nor the series.",9
"
                ** Probably small spoilers abound! **
Oh boy, where to begin with this show?  I'm not a quitter when it comes to anime, I tend to follow through with things. Sword Art was no exception. I'm pretty tolerant, but this anime was an absolute trainwreck. I feel like I've been somewhat generous with this review.
I watched this anime knowing of some of the controversy circling around it. Knowing me I though ahh well, it can't be that bad right?
I was so wrong.
Story: 3/10
Enter the VRMMORPG Sword Art Online, a virtual reality game with a nasty twist. The first two episodes of this show are pretty
                  solid. We are introduced to the problem, the world, and of course our main character - Kirito, a quite promising looking protagonist who already has some experience playing the game. Then it just...goes downhill from there.
The time skips make the pacing of the show confusing and erratic. The show relies mostly on filler episodes featuring Kirito and his many lady friends that no one cares about. What was even the point of most of those episodes anyway except for showing off how our perfect protagonist can make any girl fall in love with him completely on accident? And why did Kirito go to such lengths to help these girls anyway? Isn't he supposed to be some determined rogue player who never wants to join a guild again after that one guild? I almost even forgot that happened. Then they tried to force in that romance with Asuna. Didn't you just love watching her cook for Kirito...This arc is summarised in 14 episodes with a deus ex machina and a hopeless villain.
Honestly, despite this arc being rushed and quite terrible in execution, it is definitely at the top of the pile of absolute garbage. On to the second arc!
Welcome to Hell. Who decided this needed a second half? One with stupid fairies nonetheless. Here's a repeat of the first arc, with even more girls to fall for Kirito! Oh the joy. Here comes Kirito and his league of babes trying to save his wife from a gross villain. Great. What's Asuna's purpose in this arc anyway? Who cares! Let's throw in some incest instead! Japan loves that stuff! And thus, this arc is concluded with another atrocious deus ex machina and it's all happy ever after! Right guys?! Right?!
Art: 6/10
I quite liked the art honestly. Which is a shame. Character design was mediocre but the scenery was pretty and was definitely one of the finer points of the show.
Sound: 6/10
Generic. The fact that I can't think of any of the soundtracks from this anime shows that it was nothing memorable. I won't give it a bad rating though because me not remembering it also means that it wasn't bad. 
Characters: 1/10
Here's where this review gets fun!
Kirito - I tried oh so hard to like him. I really did. My problem with him lies mostly on being boring. Whereas with other characters, I hated what they did to said characters rather than hating the characters themselves. He started off as a strong protagonist with some promise in the first episode or so. Why did they do this to you Kirito? He had absolutely zero character development. Talk about a blank slate. Not a single flaw. He had no trouble killing any boss solo, had fun being incredibly overpowered and making all the girls fall at his feet. The worst part was he just...so goddamn nice! If they made this guy a jerk I think I could've hated him with a bit of respect! He was just so awfully bland. Ridiculous.
Asuna - Kirito's love interest. Is there...anything more to say about her really? That was her purpose. They started off with a seemingly strong, independant female character who seemed to have no problem holding her own. She switched around a lot between being strong and suddenly needing Kirito to come save her at the snap of his fingers. Make up your damn mind! While her archetype of a tsundere was repetitive and annoying, you could perhaps warm to her a little. A little. Until they destroyed her by making her hopelessly in love with Kirito and having her become pitifully helpless. The second arc was a disgrace. They tossed any personality she had out the window so she could be a helpless doll held captive for Kirito to save. She might as well just of been a sack of potatoes with female genitalia for the villain to attempt to exploit. I was very disappointed.
Yui - Used to cheat the game basically. I can't believe Kirito and Asuna wanted to actually adopt this little bundle of atrocity. She had no purpose except to be a plot device and help Kirito in his quest to be the biggest overkill protagonist ever lived.
Suguha - She's worth a mention. Kirito's little...sister...cousin thing. As much as I hated the second arc's villain, she takes the cake for most hated character in this anime. She is nothing but a nuisance doting on Kirito. Once again, a female character who showed a tiny bit of promise before they decide to destroy every shred of dignity she had by Kirito just...exisiting. Right. She's there to throw in the necessary incest to make this show a complete trainwreck. It's totally appropriate to fall in love with your cousin right? How stupid could she be, Kirito clearly looked no different in the game I don't understand how she didn't make the connection. The ""heart-wrenching"" scenes between her and Kirito fell flat. She was always better off with that shy brat of a classmate she had.
Akihiko - Had potential to be a good villain! But they decided that actually, instead of just making him a jerk who wanted to play with people's lives or whatever, they decided to play him off as a grey-villain and ""I'm kind of a good guy"". He served to make the situation and give Kirito extra god powers. That's about it. I would've preferred a ""I did it for the lols"" explanation for his actions than what we actually got.
Nobuyuki - I absolutely detest this guy. Not only was his in-game character absolutely laughable (was he going for the Legolas elf look?) his character in its entirety was just atrocious. Are we not going to talk about how he's a man in his 20's and Asuna is an underage girl or...? It wasn't just me who got incredibly uncomfortable when he was sniffing the hair of her unconscious body? Ugh.
Side characters - Who even cares? Most of them are just pointless girls who worship Kirito. Such as that one girl who died and we got to watch them replay her death over and over again. I think that was supposed to be sad. Huh. I don't even remember her name. Please replace the protagonist with someone like Agil or Klein. Please.
Enjoyment: 3/10
What was there to enjoy? This anime was erratic, gross, and very poorly executed. 
Overall: 3/10
Get rid of Kirito and replace him with a decent protagonist instead of a overpowered babe-magnet. Get rid of the romance. Get rid of the second arc and stretch the first arc over the 25 episodes. Stop relying on filler episodes.
And ta-daa! We have a potentially half-decent anime! 
If you can deal with some of the more uncomfortable scenes then go ahead and watch this show to laugh at it! But don't expect anything actually good.",3

                    Sword Art Online has managed to garner both a large following and a very bad reputation for being ""the worst anime of all time"" in the relatively short while that it's been out. My personal opinion of SAO was that, no, it wasn't the best anime I've ever seen, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I mean, there are some really, really bad anime out there, and I don't think that SAO holds a candle to the horrors of some of them. And I'll tell you why.
    I have mixed feelings about the Story of Sword Art Online.
                  The concept of the anime is a very interesting one, I think, and certainly has an appeal to all of the hardcore gamers out there. I enjoyed the story quite a bit... for the first half of the show, that is. I think that I would have enjoyed the anime a lot more if it had been shorter, which sounds weird to say, but it's true. By the end it hardly even seemed like SAO anymore, and I missed Kirito and Asuna being in the world of the original game. So I gave the story a 7, because I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy the storyline in the second half of the show as much as I had for the first.
    The art, I really have no complaints about. I don't think that there was anything wrong with it, and the fight scenes were pretty well animated. Same goes for the sound, it was alright. I liked the VA's, so I gave it an 8. 
      The characters are the other thing I had some qualms about. Kirito's not the problem for me, although I know a lot of people didn't like his character. I actually really liked him. Asuna was fine, too. But I feel like I still don't really know most of the supporting characters very well. In most anime, there's a lot of supporting characters that actually play a big part in the story, but most of (though not all) of these characters were just sort of thrown in for the filler episodes. Take Klein, for example. If you had to give a description of him, what would you say? He's funny, I suppose. But I sort of feel like I got a better hold on his personality from Sword Art Offline, the specials, than I did from the anime itself. 
   Because of the strange storyline and a bit of something lacking in the character department, I felt like I couldn't enjoy SAO as much as I wanted to. That's not to say that it's not worth watching, though. 
   Overall, I gave Sword Art Online an 8. I wouldn't recommend watching it if you're looking for an anime with an incredible storyline, but I'd say that it was a fairly enjoyable watch and it kept me interested throughout. Just don't take it too seriously, and watch it for the entertainment value! I think you'll find it a lot more enjoyable that way.",8

AUTHOR'S NOTE: 
First of all, I would like to say I've enjoyed a lot of the reviews about Sword Art Online (SAO), as they were absolutely HILARIOUS (mostly negative ones). I promise not to rant too much and give a proper analysis on why I've given the ratings for each category. Of course, you may disagree with me. Feel free to check my profile to view my alternate review status.
STORY (3/10):
I understand that many of our viewers have anticipated or were encouraged that SAO was a masterpiece. That is not the case for me.
                  I will not rate an anime until I've finished it and understood it. A critic must always look out for the least expected flaws while others swallow up the praise that this anime receives. Oh, how easy it was to spot those flaws.
A good storyline at least puts the hero through a trialing period until he grows stronger from experience. Pokemon, is an elementary example. SAO's storyline is below elementary. The villains traps the hero/heroine in a virtual prison and must beat the game in order to reclaim their real lives before time runs out? Isn't that the REALITY of what you consider today, a hopeless game freak? But what do you expect from an anime about being stuck in a virtual universe? You fight until you get enough experience and with romantic love being the dues ex machina, the storyline becomes a simple boy meets girl story through a worldwide network. And that's all it is, folks. There is no symbolism, no deep analysis of the characters, full of plot holes...there is absolutely nothing interesting about SAO's storyline. I've realized that SAO is not an anime about a game. It's a romance anime where the hero falls in love with the heroine -- online. That makes me puke in disgust.
ART (9/10):
I can imagine the production team gathered in the meeting room, discussing for hours about how the art needs to be perfect, so perfect that they completely forgot about the storyline. The art is outstanding and blows you away out of the water with its visuals. Since we are talking about a future Japan with surpassing technologies, at least the production team got one thing right. The background is tantalizing and extremely detailed. You can tell that they were not lazy when it comes to bringing orgasms for the eyes (no pun intended). I'm impressive at every scenery they show in SAO and they seem to have the right tools to make this anime as realistic as possible.
The fight scenes are ridiculously intricate, providing first-class animation with extra-fluid movements. Every swing of a weapon in SAO is noticeable and up in your face so you won't miss a fight scene when you see one.
SOUND (8/10):
The first half of the OP, ""Crossing Field"" by LiSA is energetic and it was this song that seduced me to watch SAO. It makes you want to run across a field and start slashing away at your enemies and stand victorious on a mountain of corpses. Yes. This song should definitely feature in a game! The production team has done a great job submerging the viewers into the anime with a powerful, resounding intro. I will say the same thing for the second half of the OP. ""Innocence"" by Eir Aoi made me want to fly to space and explode with a force of a thousand suns then free fall back to Earth.
The first half of the EP is ""Yume Sekai"" sung by Haruka Tomatsu, who is quite the popular Japanese artist. Personally, I don't think the song really fits SAO, no matter how much romance was suggested in the anime. By no means am I saying Haruka is horrible, but it's awkward when it clashes with the conflicts that hero/heroine deals with in SAO. The song just does not fit with the plot and fails to bring additional emotions. But I'm sure the J-music fans were screaming in ecstasy when her soft, crisp voice reverberated for the first half of the endings. The second half of EP, ""Overfly"" by Luna Haruna is a totally different story. Since the second half of SAO brought new characters and new conflicts, I felt this song blended perfectly into it. I admit that when it first played in the anime, I got chills.
CHARACTER (2/10):
All I have to say for the characters is -- burn. Burn thoroughly in hellfire. From the beginning to the end, there is no growth in character development for the hero, Kazuto Kirigaya, nor the heroines, Suguha Kirigaya and Azusa Yuuki. They are exactly the same personality from when you are first introduced to them in the beginning of the anime. The only thing that seemed to flourish is their repetitive romantic relationship(s). I don't really have anything else to say, because there is nothing to further analyze about the characters. I did have some interest in the villains as they were shrouded in mystery until the end. But the ending was just a plot hole to reinforce more romance. Their allies and friends are helpless background decorations (much like Yamcha in DBZ), as the hero/heroine end up obliterating the problem themselves. Yui, the loli mascot of SAO is my favorite character though she does absolutely nothing other than bring fan service (I'm not complaining).
OVERALL (6/10):
The only thing that kept me hooked on SAO was Yui and the OPs. I think I'm being pretty damn fair to rate this a 6 (although my version of 6 is ""Eh...""). I feel the production team were not looking to create an intelligent, sophisticated anime but rather target MMORPG gamers and J-music fans. As mentioned above, SAO is a mediocre romance anime which suggestively takes place in a worldwide network. If you are looking for theme songs that will blow you away with amazing graphics to boot, SAO is compatible for you. Personally, as a romance fan, it hasn't moved me at all.",6
"
                I feel that due to my love of the characters, and this being one of the first animes I have ever completed I may be rating this anime a little higher than it deserves.
**THIS MAY CONTAIN WHAT PEOPLE MAY CALL A SPOILER*** 
Lets start with what I do not like about this... I found that the first half of this anime was extremely rushed. It lacked some character development and there were points when I honestly thought that I missed episodes. The fact that he was in SAO for 2 years and it only lasted 14 episodes is a good indicator on how much they
                  left out and how much more they could have added.  I was not a fan of Alfheim Online. Although they pacing for this was a lot better, the concept kind of got under my skin. The fact that Asuna was such a strong player in SAO, but is locked up in a cage so vulnerable is completely out of character.
Desptie all that I can not get over the perfect relationship between Kirito and Asuna. It is a cute love story. I also am in love with the concept of the show, being stuck in a MMO. If this was paced out differently than I can say this would be my top anime, but sadly it lacked the beginning connections.",6
"
                SAO is one of those anime that had potential to be something amazing but in the end ruined by horrible writing, characters and fan service.
STORY:
Everyone gets trapped in the new VMMO and if you die in the game you die in real life and the only way out is to clear floors of the game's tower to escape.
At the first episode, the anime has already built a strong premise as it created tension, suspense and chaos through death. Unfortunately the next episodes couldn't keep up the momentum and the series degraded into something like this:
Enemy appears and attacks the girl ----> MC comes in, defeats
                  the enemy effortlessly and saves the girl -----> Girl falls in love for MC for no other reason than being saved.
Rinse and repeat that every other episode. 
Even the anime fails at melodrama when at one time MC joins a guild but for some reason he was struggling to kill the monsters  and fails to save his guild members. Those guild members were only shown 1 episode so how can you make me feel something for those guys when I barely knew who they are.
Moving on to the ending/climax  of show of the first season, we are shown MC finally confronts the main villain who caused all this trouble and after a flashy melodramatic battle, MC wins because of plot armor and finally everyone is free.
The main villain finally defeated is confronted by MC and now we will finally learn why the villain did it in the first place and all he can say is: ""I forgot."" Are you fcking kidding me? That's one of the worst cop outs ever by whoever made this shit.
I wouldn't go into detail about the second season as it is the same as the first one but with more fan service, lamer characters, tentacle rape, no more dying in real life and having one of the lamest villains ever.
ART:
This is where SAO excels, flashy colors and fluid battle movements. No problem here but nothing amazing either.
SOUND:
No problem either. Everything is fair from the sounds of swords clashing to opening and ending songs but nothing amazing either.
CHARACTER:
The worst part of the anime. The whole anime basically focuses on Gary Stu MC Kirito and his Mary Sue waifu Asuna having a honey moon vacation in SAO as first priority instead of beating the game and finally go home.
Kirito is basically a wish fulfillment character that he always wins much like the logic that ""batman wins because he is batman"".Nothing is shown about who he really is other than he is a guy who plays video games his entire life, a chick magnet for no reason and always wins. It's really very hard to connect to a character like this as he has no realistic traits other than he is good at video games.
Asuna at first is presented as the strong and silent type during the first few episodes. Later on she degrades into a tsundere Mary Sue and personal waifu of Kirito for no reason other than he is Kirito and he gets all the girls.
Then we have Kayaba the main villain who pretended to be a player and guild master of the strongest guild in the game without an explaination. Nothing is shown about him through the entire series even in his death where he just says he ""Forgot"" why he did it in the first place. Basically he is just a Troll who did everything for the ""lulz"".
Lastly we have the token side characters that gets 1 episode screen time then thrown to the garbage bin after their episode ends and are never again seen until the end of the anime.
Oh yeah there are also 2nd season characters where the villain is a jailbait rapist but I won't waste time as they are clearly bad without an explanation.
ENJOYMENT:
To be honest, I was guilty of liking it back then when I didn't care about quality at all just like when I was watching DBZ. Most people would probably enjoy this as their gateway to anime.
OVERALL:
Clearly overrated. If you want something well written and doesn't make you cringe, stay away from this. If you are new to anime and want something easy to like then yes, you can easily enjoy this anime.",3

                Sword Art Online is probably the most hated and most loved show in recent history. I have never seen so many cries of praise and disdain for a single series over the past 5 or so years that I've been watching anime. So, where to begin with this one....
My review will be on the first arc of Sword Art Online, because even I know that ALfhiem was god-awful.
Story: 6
The first 14 or so episodes were fine; they're the only redeeming part of the story in my eyes. The first arc sets up the show, death game and all, follows Kirito and his not so struggles
                  through the virtual world, and climaxes with the end of the game. Seems standard to me. 
The setting of the game was the main hook for me, and I'm sure it was too for the thousands of crazy fans who give this show perfect scores. So many of us are enthralled and intrigued by the idea of a death game in a floating castle created by a madman. So many of us want to give up our lives and be a part of the world of Aincrad, a fake castle in a fake game in a fake universe. Usually, only the biggest of anime fans want to live in the settings of their shows, but this series draws in people of all experience levels and makes them want to play a part in it.
There aren't many outstanding twists and turns through the story; it's mostly Kirito and whatever girl he happens to be with at the time taking a stroll through Aincrad until they come across an obstacle that the girl couldn't get past alone and Kirito overcomes it, making the girl fall in love with him. His harem builds, he finds the *one* for him, and tries to settle down with her. Throw in a few good action scenes and a relatively good ending, and that's about all there is to say about the story. 
Art: 8
The art design is crisp and clean for the most part, the backgrounds are nice, but the some instances of action scenes look rushed and sloppy. Not Naruto vs Pain fight rushed, but they're clearly not on par with the rest of the visuals. 
Sound: 9
One of my favorite parts of the show. I'd get goosebumps every week when the opening theme played. The setting music works nicely with the scenes, and the voice acting is pretty good in my opinion.
Character: 5
From most reviews I've read, the characters are the most hated and critically panned part of the show. For the most part, I can agree; many of the characters are one dimensional, and there is little to no character growth throughout the series. However, I find many of them endearing, quirky, or just likable. Who knows, I have the strangest taste in characters.
Just a tangent about why I believe everyone loves Kirito and why he has to be overpowered. Kirito is meant to be the embodiment of the 16 year old boy inside of us who wants to be the badass hero that can defeat any enemy and overcome all struggles. He's meant to be the lady's man covered in women that some from stereotypical gamer culture wish to be. He's a weak character because he is a stereotype; no one wants to watch a MC struggle and grind to be a mediocre-at-best fighter. They want to see their hero take on all challenges that come his way and overcome them using his immense power.
Enjoyment: 10
Probably the only reason I'm giving this show such a high rating. For some reason, I immensely enjoyed this show. The idea of a death game in a fantasy world appeals heavily to me, being a huge RPG fan. I'd love to spend an afternoon questing in Aincrad with my band of buddies trapped with me.
Overall: 8
It's not hard to see why many critics hate Sword Art for being shallow in the plot and character department, but personally it makes up for it with a great setting, nice action sequences, and good animation and sound. Love it or hate it, Sword Art is probably going to be around for a while.",8
"
                      To the small number of people who haven't seen this show man i actually feel bad for you. You must be so confused as to what quality SAO actually is because all people ever say about SAO is that it is the second coming of anime christ or the spawn of satan. But god knows neither side is right.
   Sword art online is neither as good or as bad as those two sides would have you believe. SAO has its fair share of ""HELL YEAH!"" and ""What the hell?"" moments that make sword art online sword art
                  online.The world is generic the concept is nothing new and there are all kinds of character tropes and archetypes benched on the sideline until it's their turn to have a brief encounter with the protagonist kirito who does his best to not come of as unoriginal as well. now you would think that right there would be enough to turn away even the most resilient anime watcher. 
   But so long as the execution aint half bad then much of the mundane can be forgiven and execution is something SAO does right.You are constantly aware that what you are watching is nothing new but its fun nonetheless. You will also come to care for the characters regardless of how unoriginal they are.
     Forced romance is a term that gets thrown around a lot when it comes to sword art online but honestly compared to other shows of the same genre SAO handles its romance pretty well at least between the two main characters.there is a gradual progression and you feel like something is actually at stake when they are in danger.
     Then there is a pretty sick end fight and a sort of he wasn't really the bad guy monologue and the credits roll.
Now this would make sword art online very good but this is not where the show ends and because of this it looses points because at this point in the show there's nothing else you can do to make the show any better. but A1 pictures tries to any ways and fails horribly as after episode 14 when they get out of sword art online the shows gets dumbed down recycled and just devolves into something lesser.
that's about all SAO has going for it now here is everything wrong with sword art online and im going to try to avoid spoilers.
1. Everything after episode 14 
2. Forced love triangle 
3. Forced INCESTUOUS love triangle (with his dumb ass sister)
4. just got out of a video game induced coma.Lets go play some video games!
5. cliched plot twist 
6. fairies yo
7. More ass pulls than you can shake a stick at 
   kirito is still the strongest at base level because technology.
   random beast transformation because magic 
   bullshit op magic that the characters randomly get 
8. Completely irrelevant political subplot with cardboard characters 
9. Tentacle rape?
10. Good villain is replaced with a boring one
11. Unexplainable game breaking feats  
12.Long heart to heart between siblings while crazy man with a knife is on his way to the hospital to possibly rape or kill your girlfriend after you humiliated him in a video game ,likely by motor vehicle while all you have is a bike but hey lets just sit here and flirt with our stupid ass sister 
13. SURPRISE! That's exactly what happens.
14.crappy ending and opening themes replace the good ones as if to subtly mock the viewer for continuing to watch the show 
All of these things are what stop sword art online from getting anything higher than a 7 from me because although episodes 1-14 are well done everything else i just ridiculous. its also worth mentioning that the animation is pretty good and i liked the soundtrack as well.",6
"
                A friend said to me ""that's the worse choice that you will make"", but i started watch this anime yesterday (8/12) and today i watched all of the episodes that have. 
It's a amazing anime, and story is perfect! For me, that really love MMORPG, was like a dream watch this anime.
If you like a little of fights, magic, games, you'll love :)

                ""Lately, there are days I can’t even remember the other world. And it isn’t just me. Recently, fewer and fewer people have been giving their all to clear the game."" -Kirito (Sword Art Online)
SAO you love it or you hate it.
Have you ever wondered, ""what will happen if I get trapped in a videogame?""
Maybe SAO is not the first one with this kind of plot, but the way that the anime develops, the characters, animation make it one of the best ones about this kind of plot, but like every anime it have their problems.
animation 8/10 : maybe the strongest point in the anime, it
                  gives that sensation of ""I'm watching a world like video game""
is amazing, I personally like the animation in the opening
The animation in my opinion is really good.
Music 6/10 : is not the best, but it's good, the music works to help the development of the scenes in the anime.
Story 6/10: is interesting, good and entertaining, the way that is developed is really good, but not really the best one, there are best stories in some other anime, good for SAO, not for other anime.
Characters 5/10: the weak point of SAO.
The characters are interesting, and almost everyone is quite likeable.
The developed of the characters is good, but for the supporting characters, the developed in the main characters is not as good as the developed for the supporting ones.
Enjoyment 7/10: this anime was interesting and entertaining, and that's the most important thing in an anime, even with the problems of the anime I enjoy it.
I personally enjoy both arcs, not just the first one, but that's just my opinion.
Overall 6.4(6)/10: SAO is a good anime, yes, it have its problems, but is good.
If you haven't seen it, I recommend you to see it.

                this is my first review, here we go.
story - 4/10
the concept of the show is not that bad, but story telling is not  good. Many things feel rushed or unneeded.The whole "" defeat the boss "" and  ""survival' thingy was completely forgotten because of ROMANCE. SAO was supposed to be 
an action anime, but it was turned into romance anime. Plus, there were timeskips 
which made th show hard to follow.
  All in all, SAO had a chance to become a great story, but didn`t  follow it`s main 
plot.
Art- 6/10the backgrounds were amazing, but the action scenes were nothing special.
sound- 8/10
defenetely best thing about SAO, the sound track is just great.
characters-2/10
characters were terrible. simply terrible. no character development, almost every female character was in love with kirito.
 kirito and asuna are great exmples of gary stu/ mary sue. asuna had a chance to be a good character, but her personality changed to become the love interest of the main character.
enjoyment- 4/10
First 3 episodes- yes, the rest-no. there were too many plot holes and issues with SAO, that is the reason I  dropped it.
overall-3/10
A very overhyped anime, which didn`t live up to expections. I don`t reccomend checking it out if you love action-you`ll be dissapointed.",3

                Sword Art Online had the chance to best one of the best animes yet it decided it make it the most disappointing anime for a long time. 
Have you guys seen the movie Click? Featuring Adam Sandlers and how he had a remote that could fast forward time, but now to make it comparable to SAO, SAO fast forward or literally skips any character development. One minute before they could be eating, and now they could be almost at bed, just how fast could this go?. The Story has a huge potential similar to a MMORPG game it has many levels distinctly different from other
                  levels in SAO in both the environment and the monsters. SAO has the possibility to explore all 100 levels in the anime and make many mini arcs in some level while skipping a few. The first episode’s pace was good but then at the second episode, we were already brought over to around 30 floors ahead. SAO could have many more dramatic scenes and possibly adding fillers or characters that actually meet back with Kirito during his mini arcs. Maybe there could be arcs where he can’t solo, and actually requires teamwork especially during the final boss fight would had been good. Maybe I have seen too many shounen and think that boss fight should be longer, at not only 5 minutes long. There are no shortcuts in life and SAO attempted to take many shortcuts leading to random arcs mostly not affecting the story at all. Were there actually any story at all? Except to protect Asuna and leave SAO. The pace in the second arc was actually ok, since the second world wasn’t as interesting and character developments should have already been made, though it did actually give a different feel.
One of the best part about SAO is its art. The art was quite good, with colourful graphics which I do like especially in a fantasy setting.  The fighting graphics were quite good it was interesting with all those moves and the flow was good. The environment was interesting such as flowery old themed area to icy mountainous regions.
The characters of SAO were pretty common to be seen, we have Kirito who is gifted and is just a overpowered person, which is fair I guess, and Asuna a powerful female lead where she fights beside Kirito and sometimes requires help which is to be expected. The thing SAO lacks primarily is character development. They basically are saying they met, they fought, they loved each other, they married. Very straight to the point, and if it was for side characters I wouldn’t mind so much but for the main characters, seriously it doesn’t work.  I have been thinking wouldn’t SAO being 52 episodes be better, 39 going towards the SAO world while the 13 could be going towards the second world, 39 episode would give them more time for character developments and adding a few arcs without it seeming that it is before forced to prolong. I would had actually preferred Asuna being an even stronger and could fight on par with Kirito.
Enjoyment:
Good thing I didn’t expect anything when I went to watch SAO, because I didn’t want to be disappointed. I can easily enjoy things and I did enjoy SAO, but it just pains me on how it is like a rough gem that is only polished to be as radiant as a rainy day , while it could have been as bright as the sun.",8
"
                SAO is what many people wish for series to be unlike many other anime the love interest is actually fulfilled .The main character is a mix of your tough guy loan wolf and your weak misfit an unlikely mix like lemon and honey which some how complements each other.The Heroin isnt a stereotype but a straight talker who knows what she desires(unlike most animes where most females are in denial till the middle).
The artistry is breath harvesting you will never see a scene undone nor a background.The characters are all well created and smoothly drawn.
The music is good but leaves much to be desired nothing
                  really distinguishes the tormentor and the op is well forgettable.
The story is a journey unlike Hack sign a similar series you actually care about the two main characters .The story can be slow but each story is a compelling as the main story.The story is like a less known roller coaster you feel the build up and thats what makes it exciting because your anticipation not like a full blown action movie where you don't remember the ride because it had no build up but a continues drop .The second half is not as nearly well done it becomes a shadow of its other half making the audience want for more.
If it werent for the second half this anime would at least a seven but  with the flaws in the second half you could call it mediocre at best.",5

                = None spoilers =
when this series aired, I was very hyped, because for the first time, there would be an anime that would tell the tale of us MMORPG gamers. But I was very disappointed.
Story: Gamers were imprisoned inside a game called Sword Art Online, and in order for them to get out, they must defeat all 100 the stages with bosses that are also powerful.
the sypnosis was, in my opinion, interesting. and that was all. It was just interesting. When I watched the first 2 episodes. it was good, enough to make me watch another episode. But as I go further with the show,
                  it became dull. and became unbearable to watch after the first part of the show.
let's go into detail: i watched the show to see the struggles of MMORPG gamers trapped inside a game. It kept me hooked because I wanted to know what they would do. Will they form an alliance? Friendships? Party? Defeat a stage Boss? How?
They did. But in a negative way that would affect the main character in a negative way that would also affect the show in a much more negative way. 
I don't mind having an MC that is pessimistic, actually, I even welcome it. But  his pessimism ruined the show. I didn't get to see the things I wanted to see and enjoy.
Art: the art is decent. Clean actually. it's not something to be remembered or to be forgotten just better than the average because of some action scenes which are practically cool and nice to watch and characters that were cutesi-ly drawn ( imo ) ( I guess this is where all of their money went XD )
Sound: OP's and Ending's were Ok, they fit they story. the sounds give off the vibe of being in a fantasy world. Voices were good too.
Character: Now, this is were it all goes down. 
Kirito: So perfect. Powerful. His development were mostly off-cam. Pessimist. dull. Can't relate to. Gary-stu. 
Asuna: for me, she was one of the most promising characters. she was the kind of heroine I'm looking for after watching so many anime they have shitty heroines. she was strong, intelligent, has leadership qualities.  but everything became crap when she fell in love. SERIOUSLY.
actually, that's all I know about her. I didn't even know anything about her likes and dislikes. she was practically a moving cardboard character that was wasted.
Suguha: Put incest in a fantasy world with wings, melodrama that are very trivial and you'll have this crap fanservice. a chocolate wrapped in gold but once you taste it, it's just full of crap.
other characters: characters?! oh! they were just their for the convenience of the story!
Enjoyment: well I enjoyed it while cursing everything that's bad about it. 
Overall: it had a promising story but they crumpled it and threw it on the trash can. watching this show will make you take an interest in it, wonder why all are such a jackass just because someone's a BETA tester ( they should actually worship him ), think when will the MC get his ass going, then will fall in love and blah bah blah. the first part of the series ends. 
then there comes the second part: it was literally unnecessary for it to have a second part. It didn't have any connection to the plot anymore! it was all just for the sake of FANSERVICE!
at the very core: SAO is a story turned love story turned incest turned princess saving and turned playing again.
( and the worst of all, there's a second season, oh, also a third season! )",4

                When any show gets popular, naturally hype will generate as to where the show is headed and how good it could possibly be. Because not everyone feels hype the same way, some people may find something thought of as great to be mediocre, or see something that people hate to be more enjoyable than people let on. Naturally, the more popular something gets, the more likely it is that there could be backlash from a show not meeting those extremely high expectations, and this is shown very well through the widely popular Sword Art Online.
Since this show released on 2012, people have been very divided
                  as to whether the show is amazing or a bottom of the barrel fanfiction story. I feel the need to set the record straight by saying that Sword Art Online is neither an amazing anime nor a terrible one.
 It's just...alright, but qualities in good and bad areas stand out.
Story (5/10)
The story follows Kazuto Kirigaya and 9,999 other players who are trapped in a massive MMO RPG called Sword Art Online, and right in the 1st episode, the game's creator removes the log out button, saying they have to overcome 100 floors of challenges to escape.
What ensues is a story of survival, suspense, action, romance and ultimately the themes of reality vs virtual reality and how playing virtually can isolate you from other people until you learn to accept them.
The first three or so episodes set up the idea that climbing the floors is a massive hurdle for many players and they show how what happens to someone close to the main protagonist, dying ultimately shapes how he, Kirito will operate in this world. The next couple episodes are mainly side stories from this quest dedicated to showing off the world and different ways people react to the death game. 
Although the suspense does drop a bit for these episodes, they still expand the world and characters. It's just a shame many only last an episode. They were entertaining, with episodes 5 & 6 in particular being an interesting implication of how people acting in this world leads to problems.
Then comes episodes 8-13, where it begins to set in that the show isn't going through its original commitment, but trying something else entirely; a blossoming romance starting between the two leads. 
This romance is actually one of the show's highlights, demonstrating how even in a virtual world, the thoughts, experiences, and ultimately love they gain for each is real. Action is still present to accommodate for the setting, but there are many scenes of the two leads just lying down and having heart to hearts, which both reflect their thoughts on situations and how they feel about each other.
The story has three main problems: pacing, side character shafting and lack of proper explanation. The pacing is a problem when some events happen too fast and are skimmed over while others go very slow and take several episodes. Side character shafting because characters are given purpose and well established characteristics but then aren't seen again, and lack of proper exclamation on certain things, mainly the lead's immense player power.
These parts are done decently well, but they decide to end the arc...rather abruptly, hallway through, in a way where the show couldn't explain itself a little better, and threw villainous motives into ambiguity. 
There's little floor climbing, but the arc before does feature character growth from the leads and a good idea of what the world is like, so it was entertaining regardless.
Then they do something totally different, and I'm mixed. Some pacing issues were fixed and they maturely handled one subject and added a bit more to the action...but completely botched the other and had content seemingly out of the show's reach. What happens to the female lead is...painful to say the least, the villain is fitting but 1 dimensional as cardboard, but at the very least it provided a sense of urgency in Kirito's quest. The best part of this was easily the ending though, with it leaving out on a really nice note. 7/10 and a 5/10, which balances out to about a 6
Animation (7.5/10)
The animation is SAO is incredibly smooth and polished. The designs of the MMO worlds and the landscapes in general really pop, and most of the weapon and boss designs are solid as well. Even the effect of monsters dying, menus, and pixels shattering all around look professional, CG is well incorporated to make bosses seem intimidating. 
Character designs are really good, if a bit similar to one another and fitting a typical mold. It's in the action scenes where animation really shines through though, delivering epic battle scene after epic battle scene, with just the right amount of flashy not to discount the sword skills. A flying battle in the 2nd half gets special mention on the animation front. True, it sometimes gets a bit too flashy or zoomed at times in the action scenes, but for the most part it's fairly well done.
Sound (8/10)
The composer for this series is well known already for great music, and it doesn't disappoint here. Songs accompany both the sweet quiet moments and the intense action scenes appropriately. Crossing Field is a major contender for one of my favorite openings, and Kirito's main theme, Swordland that plays when he finishes a fight, evokes a sense of awesomeness. Pretty great all around even if a bit similar to her past works.
Characters (5/10)
This is where it gets rough. Many people hate the characters in this show with a passion but personally, I didn't think they were BAD characters, some just needed a bit more.
The main lead, Kirito, is notorious in the anime community. With accusations about him being perfect, attracting girls for no reason, or being wish fulfillment for teenage boys.
None of these felt true. Our lead is flawed by a loner complex shutting others out emotionally, survivor guilt, a reckless tendency to throw himself into danger and nearly die for it, and it's through other characters he learns to overcome these flaws, maybe not developing too much in personality or strength but in will. It's through his admirable qualities he is well liked by the game's female populace, not just because he's the main character. It's because of something reasonable kind that gets this attraction, and he does end up truly falling for the main female lead, so the others don't provide a big thorn in the show's side. As for being wish fulfillment, think of it this way: almost any popular well known fictional hero, be it in movies, comic books or TV shows, fulfills some form of wish fulfillment, but they have relatable qualities in spite of that. The same can be said for Kirito. My only problem is that his strength is unreasonably high on several different occasions, but we do see him struggle more than once and fall into problems emotionally because of his faults.
Next, Asuna, the main female lead. She starts off a mysterious badass, but then overtime shows her softer side, as someone emotionally vulnerable pushing herself to the upmost limits to get out of the game as soon as possible. It's through Kirito's help that Asuna grows as a person to appreciate life rather than throwing it all away, and from her point of view it makes sense why she would like him. He follows a different path than her, but they both learn from each other to keep each other sane and happy in a merciless world of death. Her attraction and Tsundere mannerisms make sense given her dignified position and over time it properly develops into true sweetness and compassion without losing her cool edge. The 2nd half does something drastic with her, unnecessarily extreme definitely, but it doesn't necessarily hurt her character since she escapes by her own actions.
The female lead in the 2nd half, Leafa, actually has a personal relationship to Kirito, and despite having feelings for him, the problems with that are played straight and both of them once again learn from each other. It's her arc to get over those feelings to truly help him in his quest.
The rest sadly get only a little bit of screentime, but at the very least those like Klein, Agil, Lizbeth, or Recon do leave a nice impression on their appearances. The villains are mixed. One is a well handled foil to our protagonists, while the 2nd arc's is a foil to that villain, but they went too far in that direction to make him sadistic to a painful extent. He gets what's coming to him though.
Enjoyment (8/10)
Though overall, despite having somewhat disappointed expectations the concept didn't go further, I enjoyed this anime a lot. The writing and characters were alright, but at least engaging enough to be invested and see where it goes. The setting was beautiful, the soundtrack was music to my ears, fight scenes were action packed, and I looked forward to seeing where it would go. Just don't expect anime Nirvana or anime Twilight.",6
"
                SAO is a lot of fun but nowhere near as good as the hype would make you think it is. It's great if you want to sit back, relax, and watch something somewhat action driven with an interesting plot but definitely doesn't have anything that really separates it from any other anime. It really is just average at best.

                OK,here we go, my first review! :)
I learned about this anime from its Opening actually.I know LiSA from Angel beats! and Fate/Zero which are among my top anime!So I decided to check Sword Art Online as well.I didn't know that it was still airing so I finished up to episode 20 in 2 days and then I was like ""What,I have to wait a week for the next one?"" That was annoying but I was eagerly awaiting  Saturdays.Anyway,on with the review. 
At first it doesn't sound as something outsanding.Just some guy that gets stuck in an online game and has to clear the game
                  to survive.But Sword Art Online is  lot more than that.It makes you understand what they're going through and how they're managing (some joining guilds and some like Kirito being solo players).But what happens when you fall in love?Your priorities change.Kirito now wants to protect Asuna and wants to be happy with her,not just endlessly fight.I have to say that Asuna and Kirito are a favorite couple of mine.They act very natural together and complete eachother :) I really missed Asuna's presence in the second part of the anime (during Alfheim Online) and the other girls who liked Kirito annoyed me,although they never did anything bad,so its cool.
In Alfheim Online we also get to see a villain who has captured Asuna and in the end we see him paying for that (I wanted to see that bastard suffer) We see a bittersweet reunion and how they're returning to their normal everyday life as much as that's possible.The ending is left quite open so I'm hoping for more.Nothing is announced yet,but time will show :)
About more technical stuff-the animation is very nice.I like the music.From the OP and ED themes my favorites are LiSA's Crossing Fields and  Overfly by Haruna Luna ( which perfectly fitted the end of ep 24!)
I hope this review was somewhat helpful.I loved the anime a lot and it's worth watching if you like romance with some action :)",9
"
                This is my first review so what I want to tell you at first is that before doing the review of the show, I want to  talk about the fans (or just viewers) of the animes.
Before do that I will advice you that I decided to use very popular animes on my examples. The animes I am mentionating are there just to help me to show you what I mean.
On my point of view there're NOT overrated animes. It is impossible nowadays to really say: ""the anime  ""______"" is the best anime ever"". It is impossible to say that because people's tastes change
                  throughout the time. We cannot say that fans of anime nowadays watch the same shows that people 10 or 20 years ago. On the same way, we cannot say that the way that many series are done in this edge is the same in which series were done before. Times change guys. 
Regarding my idea that there're not overrated animes just let me please you something. Why was SAO so popular on 2012? Why was SnK so famous last year? Why the best anime of this year is (and it is just an example because I dont know what people will say of the animes this year) Tokyo esp?. Well, the answer is simple. People like it so much those animes. If an anime reached a very large popularity it is probably because poeple really liked that anime. It is unrespectful to say that an anime is overrated just because you saw it and you didn't like it as much as maybe other animes you have seen. Anime is not exactly about fashions. To illustrate, in 2011 maybe the most famous was Mirai nikki (and as I said before it is just an example), and then in 2012 people got crazy with SAO, and then in 2013 people loved to dead SnK. What it means is just that for many people there are still new shows which can become their favorite. It won't be weird to find out on 2015 that the best anime ever is not SAO or Snk but Fate zero.
Of course there will be lots of people who still will prefer ""old"" animes such as cowboy bebop, slayers or DBZ. Then I say to you: Please don't say that anime before was better.The idea of watching anime is not to be close-minded to the changes. Rmemember that new fans are coming and it will be very common that begginers in the anime just watch animes from 2006 so on and don't care on watching classics as Evangelion. Maybe some years later Steins gate will become ""the new classic"" and Evangelion will be forgotten.
To wrap up, Anime is just about likes. It is not very intelligent to discuss which anime is the best beacuse it willl never happen that ALL people agree. Of course there can be recommendations, but don´t take recommendations as orders that avoid you to watch an anime that you might like. Just enjoy an anime and if you want to just share your opinion of why is it bad or good, but never ever judge an anime as the worst one. Just remember, there're lots of people with lots of different tastes.
Now besides all that advice, I'll proceed to give MY personal opinion.
As we know SAO has been a very controversial anime because the opinions are extremely divided. And the reason they´re divided is probably because of the twists that the story has.
Story: 1st arc: 8/10. The story in the first two chapters seems like the serie willl be about a group of people trying to finish the game. (At this pont I don´t give so much details because you are suppossed to read the summary first) I think here´s come the first reason of why opinions are divided. Many people (Most of them gamers maybe) were expecting that the serie continues straight with the story presented in the first two chapters. I mean, lots of people wanted to see how they actually finished the game and that's all. But here appears the first twist. After the second chapter the story takes a different way to develop. We'll notice in the show some parts of comedy, action and romance (and a little bit of fan service too) that are not very connected with the principal story that is suppossed to be finishing the game. Well, maybe it is connected with the story but actually without the situations that are presented between chapters 3-8 (more or less) we ould say that the progress is very slow. Is in this part when I noticed that the focus of the story was not really beating the game but show how while they advance in the game the MC, who got an harem (and many people, including my self, believe that it was not neccesary that the MC had an harem) and the female MC interact until fall in love. So in this point of the story many people dropped the show because it finishes being a romance anime on chapters 10-14 (more or less) and at the same time many people who was boring with watching how they advanced in the game got happy because of the relation ships of the characters.  For this frst arc what I can say is that it has of all a little bit: action, comedy, romance, mistery (in a pair of chapters xD ), etc.... As it has all that I´ll give it an 8 because to me seemed interesting .
Now the real problem comes on the 2nd arc..... 6/10
The problem with this part of the story is the drastical change of the show. We'll be introduced in a new game with some new characters. The problem here is that the new game and the reason to finished it are not pretty good. To illustrate the feelings of who followed the anime, let´s say that you just watched your favorite movie, then you decided to see another movie that compared with your favorite one is not very interesting. That´s exactly what heppened here. Maybe the idea of the arc is not bad, but compared with the first part just let´s say taht is weak.
Art: 8/10
The art and the animation is one of the strongest points of the show. Maybe the art or the animation are not such great as other animes but without doubt is pretty good and it is above the average. I like it a lot.
Sound: 8/10
I'm very hard to convince when the topic is music. I loved the first opening and the second one was just good. The endings didn't produce me nothing special. The ost was cool enough. It had the level that it required for the show. It wasn´t epic but enjoyable.
Characters: 8/10
Nowadays most of the characters of anime are clasified and the result is that many charachters of this industry are judged as cliché characters. For me SAO doesn't have any original character but still you can like or dislike them.
For many people who watched the show, I think their main problem was the MC. Kirito was judged as a bad character because was the typical OP MC who was wanted by lots of girls. But as well as this attitude is hated by many, there's probably many people who loved his expressions and the character himself.
It is useless to talk about characters, specially if there are many tipes as in this case, because the reactions of dfferent people will be very different for sure. To exemplify, the female MC, asuna, has a tsundere attitude in a good part of the show. People who hates tsunderes probably will hate her and in the other hand people who love tsunderes will probably like her a lot.
I like it Asuna and some other characters so I'll give them a 8
Enjoyment: 8/10
This is the most important part, In the end nothing cares if you enjoyed the show. There are sometme that a serie can have a very bad story, sound, art, characters, etc and still you can enjoyed it. I know the show has many mistakes but I'll be lying if I say that I didn't enjoy it. I liked to see the battles and the romance parts and sometimes the show was just bored. I´ll give it a 8
Overall: 8/10
I´ll give it a 8. In my opinion it is not the best anime I have seen but I like it. I would recommend it because is a simple story that can be interesting if you get engaged. Just remember, I´m just sharing my opinion about it, it is not my fault if some of you watch this show because of my recommendation and in the end you don't like it and I don't want to see people messaging me that they hate me because I didn't say it was a masterpiece.
Thx for the attention and sorry for the mistakes on the writting.... I'm not a native speaker and I'm still studying the language.",8
"
                What attracted me to this show actually wasn't the hype around it at the time, but the split opinions.  I was fascinated to see this on top 10 best lists and top 10 worsts lists.  I am kind of in the middle: I think overall it is a good show that is fun to watch.  I think what draws people to this show is the setting that it created.  It creates an interesting world that is constantly introducing interesting ideas that keep you wanting to see more of whats in store.  This is my third review, and I am changing
                  up and experimenting with the format I will use.  My goal is to try to give my honest opinion, and try to explain the pros and cons.  I will try to be neutral in my future reviews and provide reasons why you may like or dislike the show. 
Story: 6.5/10 (decent)
The first half actually does what I think more action/romance anime for simple entertainment should do.  It sets up its premise incredibly well and then expands on it nicely.  It explores the world, and shows how different people deal with it or react to it.  Some people accept the world and just want to get used to living in it.  Others can't accept the world they are in and try to group together and break out.  These lead to some cool ideas and actually has you question how it would be like if people were stuck in a virtual world for so long.  If there is one problem I have with the first half, its that it could have expanded on these ideas more.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of time skips and the pace moves a little too fast for my liking.  The biggest problem of the show is the narrative in the second half.  Without spoiling too much: it loses a lot of the tension in the first half, has a new cliche over-the-top villain with a laughable motive, and it revolves solely on a love story which you may or may not be on board with.
Characters: 5/10 (average)
The characters aren't the big highlights for this show.  For the most part are likable and well established in the first half, but don't expect too much depth in their development.  One of the elements of the show that has the most mixed response is the romance.  Some people LOVE the romance, others see it as poorly written teen drama.  I personally think it works.  Is it a unique and well written romance?  Not really.  But, do the characters have good chemistry and are you rooting for them?  I would actually say yes.  They fit each other well and it doesn't feel totally unbelievable especially under the circumstances they are in.  I do have a problem on how the characters are treated in the second half however.  The side characters in the second half are completely forgettable and the main heroin is reduced to a damsel in distress.
Art/Animation: 9/10 (Near perfection)
Part of the reason why this show succeeds so much is the world that is created.  The setting is beautiful and you really feel like your in a video game that you almost wish you were in (minus the death penalty :p).  The action scenes are terrific: short, creative and exciting.  And I personally love the designs of some of the bosses in the world.
Sound: 10/10 (Perfect)
Yuki Kajiura is one of my favourite composers in anime and the ost is perfect for this show.  Swordland in particular is fantastic, making each fight scene feel epic and exciting.
Enjoyment: 8/10 (overall a fun show!)
Personally, I really enjoyed the first half a lot and if I rewatch the show I probably will only watch the first fourteen episodes.  To me its harmless entertainment and good escapism if that is what your looking for.  I also played quite a bit of video games so this show did appeal to me.  The second half had a plot that was a little too dumb for my taste and I am never a fan of love triangles; however if you can turn your brain off and tolerate these things then you might enjoy it more than I did.    
Overall: 6/10 (above average)
In conclusion, if you are a gamer or someone who likes to get lost in a fantasy world with a simple and straightforward story this will probably appeal to you.  If you are looking for a lot of depth or raise your expectations too high you probably won't like it.",6
"
                Let me just get this off my chest before starting the review as always: I'm a fan of Reki Kawaharas works no matter what the ardent haters say or think. 
Now that that's settled I'm guessing some of you who even bothered to read this damn review are wondering about the low score despite the declaration above. And fair warning but most of what you are about to read is just plain ranting and most of it has been said by countless others before me so if you're not in the mood for that then please stop reading and change the web page now...........................
Still w/ me? Hoookay then. First of all let me start by saying I absolutely adore SAO. It's the series that got me into reading LNs (Light Novels) in the first place along w/ To Aru Majutsu no Index. I loved it so much I was sneaking peeks at the baka-tsuki web site for updates using my workstation PC behind my boss's back. Risk of being fired straight away be damned! But, like countless other adaptations of a written work, a lot of what A-1 has done w/ the anime just degrades the series in it's entirety it's become cringe worthy even for die hard fans such as myself. 
(Story/Characters)
THIS is where the adaptation failed the most. I know the futility of arguing about how great the source material is to an uncaring bunch so I'll not do that for the sake of my health. But I'll try to point out the things w/c made this adaptation such a train wreck anyway. 
Some have complained about the countless time skips the anime implemented though out the first arc saying it's too abrupt a transition and that it had a ton of wasted potential. Apparently Reki agrees as he is currently working on a remake of the Aincrad arc called Sword Art Online: Progressive w/c would recount the adventures of our MC Kirito over the two years they spent trapped inside Aincrad giving it a more fleshed out feel and better pacing. See this series was originally an entry piece to a one-shot novel writing contest w/ a very strict and specific word count way back when. It's only after it's growing popularity that Reki was told to come up w/ follow up novels. But since the demand for the continuation of the original work was high he wrote a direct sequel w/out fleshing out the prequel resulting in a work w/c had problems when it comes to story transition and character development. Would the story have been better if they waited for Progressive to finish? I don't really know. But I do know that it would've flowed better.
As for the story itself there is no denying the fact that it's Shounen w/ a blatant self-insert OP MC. It's cliche as hell and the pseudo harem can be really annoying. But it has it's moments. And what actually adds to it's charm is Rekis writing style. He conveys a lot of different emotions and scenes expressively while managing to pack it in as less words as possible. It's not very wordy and comes in easily digestible paragraphs w/ occasional moments of dry wit, sarcasm and silliness. Kiritos inner monologues are amusing and at times bizarre w/c made reading them such a joy. 
I'm sure the ones on the other side of the fence vehemently disagree I'm not touching that even w/ a 20 foot pole. One can argue that this is just Reki trying to dress up a poor story by using walls of text. But really people. There are countless other literary works out there and there exists not one sure fire way to differentiate ones work from the rest of the pack. If being able to add color to a cliche story and setting by using wordplay isn't a sign of a competent writer then the world really does lean towards the idea ""Originality is King"" more so than I had initially thought. I've seen countless other works fall flat on their collective faces even after boasting strikingly original concepts though so I don't even know what to think now.            
So after all that ranting I assume you've already had an inkling of what I was going to say next. What? No?... My bad then. Anyway the point is that the crux of this series is Kawahara Rekis writing. There are no too ways about it. The internal monologues and colorful scene and character descriptions add flair to an otherwise bland story. The anime fails to incorporate even an inkling of that w/c is why it failed for the most part. 
(Art/Sound)
The art I can live w/. Despite having fluid animation most of the time I find it real hard to look at the character art w/c really looks like Poplar and the gang from Working! w/c is understandable given it's A-1. But it doesn't really remove my misgivings w/ the art. The fanservice... meh it was in the novels too but at least it was fairly less overt that what the anime made it seem to be. But I do agree Reki f*cked up w/ the tentacle scene. I'll give you that. Most fans agree actually. 
As for the music well I honestly felt it wasn't on par w/ Kaijura Yuukis other works. You can make all kinds of assumptions as to why this was the case but I won't jump on that too thank you.
(Overall)
Shame. A real damn shame. I still like SAO and probably will continue to like it but the adaptation really does such a poor job at conveying most of the things that made me (and other fans) like it as much as we have it really leaves you w/ a bad aftertaste. And for the legions upon legions of SAO haters out there... I feel you guys. I really do. My one single flickering hope is that the new season would at least upgrade this series as ""watchable"" instead  of ""utter trash"" in your collective books. I know that's just wishful thinking but well... people can hope right?",6

                  that. I certainly can make a review that deserves ""Constructive Criticism"", but I certainly don't intend on EVER making a ""Bad Review"" of anything. Anyway, rant over. Onto another review.
Sword Art Online is definitely one of those anime that caught me a little off-guard. I was kinda expecting a whole lot from it, but it didn't exactly deliver it how I wanted it to.
The Story revolves around this thing called the Nerve Gear, which puts you into a virtual reality state within video games, which is AWESOME! Sword Art Online was one of the first games on the market with the Nerve Gear, and only around 10,000 people could get it. Kirito was one of those people, but there was a catch that people didn't realize. Once you go into the game, you are stuck there, and if you die in the game, you die in real life. That was an interesting twist, but once they went ahead into the next couple of episodes, apparently there was a time skip that confused the hell out of me, and there weren't any explanations to it. Also, along the way Kirito meets up with various different characters, primarily women, who help him along his journey to defeat all the levels of the game, which apparently is the only way out of the game. Then, apparently when the stuff with SAO was done, a new game called Alfheim online came out, and in this one, if you die in the game, its actually okay... what? The only major problem I had with this was the fact that it was a bit too rushed with the story, especially with Sword Art part. I am surprised I even am giving it the score that I am, but it was still well done. (8/10)
The Art was simply amazing. For an anime that came out only a few years ago, it surpassed my expectations with the artistry and physics engine within the anime. Now, it wasn't perfect, because I have seen slightly better within 2012, but it was VERY well done, except for a couple of minor parts that I nitpicked. (9/10)
The Sound was pretty good, but it wasn't great. There were definitely some excessively used songs in it that were very well placed and are epic, but the opening and endings were more mediocre, simply because they were a bit wonky for my taste. (8/10)
Now, unfortunately, I have to say that the characters were probably the worst aspect of this anime. Now, Kirito and Asuna are probably one of the best anime romances I have seen in awhile, despite it being somewhat forced, but that is because mostly of the situation. However, all the other characters were mostly there to fulfill their respective roles, and that was pretty much it. They were special in their own way, but they weren't great, nor horrible. (7/10)
Overall, this anime did its job and compelled me to watch further, and it was very enjoyable, but there were apparent mistakes with the story, characters, etc. that were apparent, so I didn't rate it too highly. It is well deserved to get this rating, but Sword Art Online II doesn't deserve nowhere near as much praise....simply because Sword Art actually concluded their story, and plus...it is pretty bad anyway...just saying (And no, I am not trying to make a review of it, because I don't even think its worthy of that, and that is my honest opinion, so don't get your panties in a wad, if I don't like the anime you do.)",8

                First review here. I've been watching anime for a bit now. I wouldn't consider myself a fresh catch or a 24/7 otaku, but here goes.
""This anime is like wish-fulfillment drug for male teenagers and adults who're addicted to online gaming and can't deal with real-life challenges. ""
Sword Art Online is that anime that all your friends are talking about. From how I see things, this show was made to attract every audience you could imagine. A romance, a black-haired skillful main character in his teens, a little siscon, and all of it pretty much rounded up inside of a virtual reality. What could go wrong?
Story
                  - 7
The writers did a great job of stating the rules of the game and giving the characters the green light. I enjoyed the overall pacing of the show's entirety, except for the very strange stop in the very middle of the season. It almost felt like intermission, where you go refill your soda and hit the restrooms while our faithful protagonist recovers from the first act. One thing that I didn't enjoy was the major, random time leaps. By the next episode, two years could have passed. You might notice a few kids in that time (thankfully it's a video game). In all seriousness, there's a sense of progression in the game despite no visual leveling system. In other words, a beginning and an end.
Art - 8
Animation is really getting great these days, isn't it? I wonder if the Japanese use Windows or Apple.. Nothing special here besides the great environments the animators wanted to flesh out into a whole new fantasy. It really did feel like an adventure and I would have liked to see more.
Sound - 8
Another good one. Even though it was a virtual world, it was definitely a good example of music put in the right places for a story.
Character - 6
While powerful main characters are considered a very controversial and volatile topic in the anime industry, some writers manage to pull it off.. Kirito is a good example of how a character doesn't have much depth and can still swing swords like some super-samurai. It makes the viewer able to blend into the world without too much to think about. Although for the other characters (the earlier episodes at least) I think they were used like warm-up sessions for the bigger picture. Sometimes I get the feeling the first few episodes of some shows are basically the studio going ""Hey, look at what we can do! Look at us! Now sit still and finish the show!""
Enjoyment - 8
This show was hyped, I was not. Smart decision.
Though I like psychological thrillers and romance, I can easily sit back and enjoy an adventure or two and be easily entertained with Sword Art Online.
Overall - 8
If you are new to watching anime, this is definitely a great place to start.
If you like to sit on your porch on a spring afternoon with a chilled beverage, not worrying about that guy's opinion on MAL about how terrible the show's character-development was, this anime is for you.",8
"
                Okay so this anime has a very good setup and premise, as well as good visual and audio design. The way they handle the menu interactions as well as game exploits is all very engaging. What is not very engaging, however, is the filler they spend most of the first arc on. In every single one of these one-shots, Kirito (the main character and a very bland person) meets a girl who invariably falls in love with him (even his female cousin during the second act). In addition, the pace of the plot kind of speeds up and slows down in a really annoying way.
                  Perhaps the highlight of the series (at least for me) was in the final episode when the antagonist, a grown man, grabs a knife in real life and ambushes Kirito (a teenager) in a dimly-lit parking lot. It serves as a stark contrast to the virtual action present in the rest of the series and is quite frankly hilarious.
Final recommendation: Watch it, if only for the good art and world design. If you can't get past a lousy story, do not watch this anime.",5

                Sword Art Online. ;D
Sword Art Online is a hilarious anime. While it's tagged as action, adventure and drama, it should definitely include the tags horror, and psychological, and comedy. 
The character development is a perfect example of the later stages of type 1 diabetes. The anime begins by introducing the character ""Kazuto"". He is something years old, he has black hair, and his parents apparently do not exist. We forget about him soon enough, because we are introduced to him again as Kirito. Kirito has black hair, he is of an unknown age, and now he doesn't even exist, as he is permanently in a
                  game. 
Why did the developers of Sword Art Online decide to trap players indefinitely so that they essentially become vegetables in real life? Was it for economic gain? No, they are going to be arrested. Was it for political gain? No, they are going to be arrested. What is the motivation of the antagonists in this story? Does society not care at all about the thousands of people who were trapped and killed in an internationally public video game? 
One month after the start of the the death game, Kirito learns that 2000 players out of the 1000 chosen for closed beta, have already died. 
Very quickly, with absolutely no story or insight, Kirito becomes the seemingly most powerful individual in SAO. 
He clearly only levels up so quick because he plays the game more than everyone else. 
Somewhere in the story, Kirito meets a group of awful players. This group of bad players have an average level that is half the level of Kirito, and have a combined IQ of around 69. 
A crazy female bad from the group breaks down to Kirito about how she is afraid to die, and Kirito immediately reassures her that he will protect her. Literally 14 seconds later, the group finds themselves stuck in a room with Kirito. 
A bunch of monsters swarm in, and Kirito waits for them all to die before quickly disposing of the monsters in 1.6 milliseconds. 
The leader of the group apparently realizes that with the death of his friends, the combined IQ of the Moonlit Black Cats is now 4, and he quickly jumps off a cliff.  Kirito watches him as he flings himself to his death. 
As it turns out, Sachi, the girl who broke down to Kirito, foresaw her own death, and recorded a message for Kirito telling him not to blame himself.
Unfortunately, Sachi's clever suicide also caused the deaths of her friends, so her post death message to Kirito was not very complete. Also, Kirito literally watched them die. 
Apparently, unlike the hundreds of human players that literally live in the towns, not doing anything, Sachi and her friends have to fight monsters and die. 
By now, the story has revealed that Kirito is a sadistic and bland person. He doesn't say anything smart, anything interesting, or anything funny. He doesn't do anything. He doesn't meet anyone that does anything. Literally nothing happens. 
Kirito quickly progresses in levels, as he spends much of his spare time playing SAO, unlike apparently the rest of the population of players. He eventually meets Asuna, 
Asuna's character can be defined as 
Sword Art Online then ends, and Kirito is freed for around 14 seconds before joining the game again, except this time with wings. 
The antagonist shows himself in the second arc, revealing his his lack of logic and character design. For some reason, he is going to be married to the vegetable Asuna, and he decides to focus the latter 12 episode of SAO trying to rape her with Kirito watching. He essentially puts Asuna in a cage for no reason, so that Kirito can save her. 
Obviously, nothing happens in a majority of the episodes before Asuna somehow escapes the cage set by the admin of the game. She is quickly discovered by two scientists, who are actually jellymen. These scientists have tentacles because they are ugly in real life. 
Eventually, Sugou, the main antagonist and sufferer of mental disabilities, begins to molest Asuna. The final battle! Finally! What the entire storyline has led to. The conclusion for this anime is literally a rape. Okay. This guy is literally getting married to Asuna, and he decides to virtually trap her for weeks, before virtually raping her? 
Eventually, it coincidentally turns out that Kirito and Asuna live in the same city, and within a bikes ride distance. 
In the end, Kirito realizes that he should continue to allow game developers to take control of people's lives, and uploads the ""world seed"" to the internet, which revives the virtual gaming genre.",9
"
                I'm going to put it on the line and say it
Story: Sword Art Online isn't good at all. It has its moments where it shows potential like when Kirito's first guild is slaughtered but who are those characters to us? We know nothing about any of them other than the fact the girl is scared of dying but who the fuck isn't at that point. The death scene itself was actually extremely well put together which makes it even more frustrating, watching all these people die but at the same time you can't help but think ""hmmm Kirito probably could've saved these guys he's like
                  level 50 at this point"" but nope, they all die anyways so Kirito's character can go ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. Don't get me started on the romance, it's so hamfisted and clearly shoehorned it for fanservice-y lovey dovey shit so they can get some female viewers. 
Art: This is where it gets REALLY insulting guys because the art is STUNNING. It's really hard for me to take my eyes away from the beautiful scenery, great action, bright colors and detailed characters. Just knowing it's supposed to represent the awful story we were given makes it so bittersweet I had to deduct a point. The animation is also extremely good with all of the characters attacks looking like they have some SERIOUS power behind them. Even the 3D stuff like the Dragon from episode 7 looked good. It's just such a shame it got paired up with this story.
Sound: The music is ok and the intro is catchy. I really don't have much to say here because it's just really really average to me. 
Character: Here we go guys this is the biggest fault of Sword Art Online, the characters. Kirito is an obnoxious edgy teenager with some kind of bipolar disorder because he keeps flipflopping from solemn loner to friendly lady's man. Not to mention there's many occasions where he could've prevented a lot of people's deaths but nope god forbid ""the black swordsman"" (Guts is the real black swordsman, by the way) do something for someone other than himself. Oh not to mention the loli, the blacksmith and the mary sue he tries to romance in the first couple of episodes. They're all annoying except for Asuna I guess, mainly because she can at least handle herself a little bit while loli girl and blacksmith scream and cry while trying to fondle Kirito's video game dick. I liked Klein or Tsuboi, he was pretty cool. 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed looking at Sword Art Online but I didn't enjoy listening to it or it's characters. The twist of the story is so generic and revealed way too early, everybody is fucking annoying (bar one character,) the romance is forced and harem-esque for what Sword Art Online is trying to be and you know what? Just do yourself a favor and watch something else. Hell go watch Attack On Titan, even it is slightly better than this wreck. You're allowed to enjoy the show guys, this is just my opinion and I feel very strong about it. Apparently it gets even worse in season 2, count me out.",2
"
                I think this show really had the potential to be a very very good show but in my opinion they somehow screwed the story with unnecessary charachters with no development at all, a predictable love story,these things?! --> (SPOILER: http://i.imgur.com/2zz3WXv.jpg),...
On the other hand the art and animation were really well done as well as the soundtrack that was really amazing. In my opinion this show is an example of wasted potential. the first episodes were amazing but they have not been able to maintain this level.
This show is really over-hyped. ",1
"
                SAO is... um... not worth watching. I don't understand why so many people watch it, and overall it is overrated.
Story: 6/10
This anime has so many genres: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Game, Romance, Shounen -> which would satisfy many people, I would be satisfied, too, but seriously, the story became worse and worse until, the latest episodes, it kept me in patience (just a little more).
I mean it would be damn great if those first episodes of adventure were OVAs or something. Everything was so slight. I don't want such multi-in-one like this, since it doesn't have enough fight scenes, it doesn't show much of Kirigaya and
                  Asuna's love development, a.k.a lack of romance and action.
I was like, ""meh, didn't really pay enough attention to this anime, but urgh why I still want to see what will happen next?""
The story was so so, novel but TOO VAPID, just like my reviews (lol). I don't like it though.
Art: 8/10
Sure the art was great, spectacular also but I don't like the way they draw those unnecessary ""sexy scenes"". It was graceless.
One more thing is that Kirigayo looks kind of weak, just my own opinion. But I don't mind watching him because that makes him cute and some.
Sound: 6/10
Meh, not memorable to me, but didn't annoy me or something.
Character: 5/10
Haizzz, I can't even stand Kirigayo's characteristic. Of course he's got his innate convincing words and his innocent mind that the girls fall for. But out of that, I would say he's just too normal for a main character.
Enjoyment: 6/10
yeah yeah it is another ""meh"" score. I want to know what happen next so bad but still the story keeps going too dramatic and too long but too fast in action/ adventure.
Overall: Don't watch this, seriously. It's too vapid. Not a good anime.
My Overall score is 6/10. My rewatch value is 0/10
I can't drop this series, I will watch the whole series though, since I don't want to dismiss things.",6
"
                Sword Art Online is the definition of ""potential"", an initial storyline that started off comfortably but left a slight bitter taste in my mouth as I progressed. Although the flaws within the anime are clearly visible, it didn't stop me from enjoying it.
<<I'll try to make this a non-bias review>>
Story 6/10
First Arc (SAO Episode 1-14):
The plot of the story was initially breathtaking. The story that if you died in the game, you would die in real life was breathtaking. The story that the characters within SAO had to clear 100 floors to log out was breathtaking. However, what I received from the anime seemed to
                  stray away from the story where we are introduced to multiple other characters and followed their journey within the world of SAO. Except that what they achieved had nothing to do with the clearing of floors, but were just random scenes in the anime which seemed rather unnecessary. It took a few episodes before the characters finally got back on track and started following the road of clearing floors and ""escaping the world they are stuck in"".  The concept of the story had massive potential but the anime seemed lackluster from around episode 4-7. The other episodes were thoroughly enjoyable however, where we get to see several floors being cleared and also development of romance between Kirito and Asuna. One massive selling point in the anime to me was the plot-twist towards the end, where it was surprisingly unexpected to me when I first watched SAO. It made the story take a massive turning point where Kirito had a choice/opportunity to clear all the floors once and for all in a single battle. ""Epic"" could probably be used to describe the last few episodes in this arc.
Second Arc (ALO Episode 15-25):
The second arc was rather disappointing. Fairies just didn't seem to suit the concept of the anime. After watching the first arc, I was expecting a plot similar to the first, but I was left with my head shaking and I never received the enjoyment that I experienced in the SAO world. One of the main drawbacks in the second arc was the removal of ""dying in the game = dying in real life"", which means that once a character died in the game they would respawn, meaning that there are no fears of dying. The objective of ALO was not very appealing too, how Kirito had to save Asuna from Sugou. I stuck through with it however, and I still ended up enjoying the action scenes and how Kirito progressed through the unknown world in which he was thrown into, or forced himself to be thrown into. 
Art + Animations 8/10
The art in SAO is not in any means unique from other anime, but it excelled in setting an atmosphere for each scene in the anime. You get bright, vivid colors in cheerful scenes, you get dark, gloomy colors in times of despair. Animations are fluid, making each swing of a sword feel impactful and causing severe damage to the receiving end. Sword skills seem powerful and doesn't seem ""forced"". There were a few scenes where sword skills seemed ""idle"" and just the background moved, but its only noticeable in a frame by frame pause. Budget Art Online
Sound 9/10
The sound in SAO was amazing, as expected from Yuki Kajiura. The sounds from the anime were enough to cause shivers and goosebumps at intense moments, while feeling contented and happy during the lively, romantic interactions between Kirito and Asuna. Only downside was the transitions of the soundtrack between scenes, which seemed unnatural and didn't flow well.
OPs and EDs were decent in both arcs, with OPs having a more ""hyped"" tone to them and EDs having a calm one, which suits what an OP and ED should achieve with the audience.
Characters 7/10
The only two characters I felt attached to were Kirito and Asuna as they had the most development between them. I felt like the other side characters were thrown around and appeared randomly, then discarded, then reappear again. Aside from the side characters, it was intriguing by how Kirito and Asuna slowly developed feelings for each other as they worked together in the VRMMO world, and it was clear that there was a transition of the initial hatred from Asuna to Kirito, then slowly accepting him, and finally being together as they realize how much they care for each other. Yui as a character was.... okay, I didn't seem bothered by a computer AI being an adopted daughter of the two main leads. She was cute at times and she did do well in strengthening the bond between Kirito and Asuna. I have mixed feelings when she says ""Daddy"" however.... a mix of cute and cringe, but I let it slide.
One of my biggest dislikes for characters within SAO was how the image of Asuna transitioned from SAO to ALO, being a strong, dependable lady to being a damsel in distress and being completely helpless in the arc of ALO, which set a sour mood for the entire second half of the anime as I enjoyed Asuna as a character from the first arc.
Enjoyment 9/10
SAO was an anime I enjoyed throughout, although there were some obvious flaws in it that I had to force myself to ignore. Action scenes felt intense and impactful. Romance and progression of the relationship between Kirito and Asuna was well made and I adored every interaction between the two of them. Soundtracks were catchy and really managed to set a direct mood as I watched. Pace of the anime was fitting for the number of episodes and seemed to flow well from episode to episode, leaving appropriate cliffhangers to make me keep craving for more. I would recommend SAO for those who love action and romance in particular, with slight drama.
Overall 7/10",7
"
                Really, after whatching the first 5 episodes I was like ""Ok, it´s just another //:hack anyme style."" HOW WRONG I WAS!! It is after episode 8 that this anime truly becomes what it is, a huge masterpiece!
First of all, it has an awsome art, not only the visual treatment of every scene is awsome, but also the concept art of every scenario you see. The music that accompanies it is not bad either, it is a music that you could expect to hear in any MMO game out there, so it fits perfectly in the serie.
But what really make this anime awsome are the characters
                  and the story, Asuna and Kirito are characters that really make you feel they are alive! Their emotions, what they do in-game etc... All seems so real. The story helps with this as the epic and dramatic turns it makes make you want to watch more and more.
In the end, and not to spoil too much, this is one of the BEST animes I´ve seen, remember that there are two parts in the same season, one that goes until episode 14 and the other one that will go until episode 25 (I guess). If you want to see a good anime show you can´t miss this one!",9
"
                This was my first anime ever, which says a lot comparing it with my score. I feel that this anime is a good entry anime to a newbie. I'm more of those casual watchers, watching for fun, but sometimes I am critical. On this one I feel more than I critic, mainly because it is my first anime. How I would critic something is if I myself learned something meaningful from the anime, which is a combination of story and characters, if I relate to them or not.
I don't find the story generic or cliche, probably because of my little experience of anime, but I
                  think that everything is a remix of something. However the story can be tweaked on a lot of areas, especially Alfheim Online. Speaking of ALO, I think that arc was simply not as enjoyable as the Aincrad arc, I didn't like Suguha, maybe even despised her, and I didn't like how they just went to a different game, but it was nice to see that the main characters reunited. 
Art was nice and crisp, with visual effects everywhere that made it very entertaining to watch, enough said.
Sound, a very nice soundtrack that goes along with the correct moments.
Characters were lacking in a lot of the cast, for example Klein, Lisbeth, Silica, and Agil. I felt like they would make a better background cast if they were to get more development since the little time they got were to showcase the potential that they could've gotten. Even though I am a fan of this anime, Kirito is not my favorite character of this series. Not because he's OP, but mainly because he doesn't relate to me to make me feel much emotion for him. Asuna is my favorite character, mainly because she has her own struggles that I can relate to. Now I don't think that she was degraded from the beginning arc to the other, I think she was just placed at a different challenges that she has to overcome, which I believe that she's the one to improve most from the experiences and I actually relate to. Not so much the rape part, but the idea that she wants to get stronger to protect others is what I'm more about.
With that said, I will just say that I watched this anime as my first, and I did take something out from this. I understand the hate for the show considering the many flaws, but nonetheless I still love it for what it is. I definitely don't believe that this is the ""best anime ever"", that just seems ridiculous. This show also hit my tastes, with gaming and a romantic story mixed in, I just enjoy that stuff. Made me enjoy it enough to be come a fan and read ahead of what's been adapted, and I feel really optimistic for this show.",9
"
                ''SAO'', Very much like'' Accel world'', In the future with advanced technology.
They both have identical set-up and that set-up is in a virtual world where you feel you're belonged into that world.
Except in'' SAO'' if you die, you actually die...To me this is a great concept to let the play feel that you must survive to survive, if that makes any sense to anyone else.
There is also the light novel you want to read it, personally the light novel is where it got me hooked onto the series.
After reading the manga and watching the first anime, I got so immersed into this series and began
                  hoping i could travel through time to watch the remainder of the series.Because i feel like it is on another level when compared to ''Accel World'', both the manga and first episode delivered so much hook for the next episode and got me into it. 
Hope everyone else find this series enjoyable and agree with me that it is definitely worth the time to watch.",10

                                       (~WARNING~ This is my first review so its probably terrible)
Well I know a lot of people will disagree with what I'm going to write but i don't really care! SAO is one of my favorite animes because...well just because!
Story: 7
Ok the story wasn't THE best ever but it was better than some. I was looking forward to this because it was about video games and anime and who doesn't like video games and anime? It had a really nice first part; the
                  battle scenes where really beautiful and i think they should have made more of them. Then it got to episode  and then it went slightly down hill. They kind of exaggerated Kirito's power which spoiled the atmosphere but i liked the second half of the story so its ok don't worry ;)
Art: 9
I think the art is amazing. That's alllllll i gotta say here
Sound: 9 
The sound tracks are really good, the opening and the endings are really good so yeah. Its better than BVB so its good for me xD
Characters: 7
There wasn't much character developing apart with Kirito and Asuna and even then you don't learn that much about them. A lot of the 'main' characters i cant even remember there names let alone anything else. And mostly all of them just turned up and then left *boom* just like that!
Enjoyment: 8
I did enjoy it alot and this being the first anime i watched properly i didn't think much while watching it so i was able to enjoy it. The story was interesting, the characters were interesting ,the artwork was beautiful so it was hard to think about the bad points.
Overall: 8/9
I really liked SAO it was amazing and so is season 2 so yeah!",8
"
                Personally, I did enjoy Sword Art Online, but not with what the anime presented me, but rather what I could have done with inside the world it described.
Raging fanboys, equivalent to the fangirls of Twilight, would most definitely disagree with me right after seeing the overall score I gave it, fine, but I wrote this review in the most objective manner I could ever possibly muster.
Sword Art Online, set in the distant 202X year, has Virtual Mass Multi-Player Online Role Playing Games available (VMMPORG), where technically, the gamer can exist in a virtual reality, feeling pain, seeing digitally constructed rendering and touch them.
It's every gamer's
                  dream, and I can see why it's hooked up so many interested viewers at the very first episode, but it quickly goes down from there.
Story: 6
Yeah, I give the setting and plot unique, but SAO could have brought it out better, no kidding.
The anime is seemingly divided into arcs. 6-7 arcs in a 25-episode anime?
Really?
Execution of the overall story was terrible, but what gave it such positive feedback is that every time. it's decorated with great graphics I won't deny, beautiful girls that fall in love with our beloved and oblivious Kirito, and some fighting scenes to please the gamers who watch this series.
This anime, which is clearly Shounen, had mini-arcs in the anime, which didn't really advance the story, except for introducing new characters, while the character development was terribly little.
It spent most of its time (no offense), catering to fetishes of guys, even though in the most subtle manner possible.
The action was bull, and I was very disappointed in the battle scenes, yes they managed to make me shudder in excitement sometimes (DUALL!!!), but it mostly lasted like 1-2 minutes, and appears every 2 or 3 episodes.
Art: 9
It's good, without a doubt, and the fighting scenes, although horribly/disappointingly short, are quite well animated in the sense that movements are not pixel by pixel, but rather smooth transitions and decent weapon effects.
The cast are also very well drawn, Kirito, Asuna, Silica, Klein, etc.
Sound: 9
The anime doesn't fail to impress you with background music that fits the scene you're watching. Be it battle, or simple tears on the characters, the accompanied music really emphasize and boost the emotions you as a viewer should be feeling.
The epic battle music, or the slow and harmonious romantic BGM.
Not to mention that the openings are great as well; Crossing Field and -I forgot the other one-.
Character: 2
As I've stated, the character development was trash, and the bane of this particular anime.
Characters introduced in their signature episodes, are immediately killed off and never appear again unless they are miraculously needed to spout 1 or 2 lines, or to even show one panel of their face.
Kirito, as we know as the dual-wielding badass, is cyber law-defying, and ferocious RPG sword master. But how did he get there?
Nope.avi, find out or fantasize yourself.
Romantic feelings between side-characters and Kirito? 
Yep, 24 minutes for each side-heroine! That's all!
Enjoyment: 5
Blatantly put, I liked it at some parts, and I didn't at others.
It's a 50/50 mixed feeling for me, sometimes it makes me anticipate the next episode, while sometimes it's just so dull that I stop watching mid-way.
It hovers between a generic shounen, and a unique story, really wasting the plot that the penning author had thought up originally.
Overall: 6
It's not that bad like other people had claimed, but also not as good as the majority fanboys would shout in protest and justify -with nothing-.
It can be quite refreshing at the start, while it rockets downwards in a negative spiral as it gets more and more predictable.",6
"
                I wasn't planning on watching this at all, the synopsis didn't appeal to me. But I did like it. It's quite good actually, though I didn't expect it to be. The plot's aright, the art is great, and character development is pretty good, nothing too stupid. I'm enjoying it overall. 
It was exciting in the beginning, I loved the objective of the first half of the anime: to finish the game and survive. I'd thought it'd be the only objective of the anime throughout but it all happened to quickly and ended so fast, it was a bit disappointing. All the characters of the first
                  half is gone too, it was saddening. 
The second objective was to get Asuna back. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's not very exciting to watch. I mean it's fun to watch but I missed the whole struggle for survival thing. 
(Spoiler) Where did his sister come from though? Why'd she have to fall in love with him only to have him reject her twice? It's kinda random, now that I think about it. Sad.",8
"
                SAO was an overly hyped up Anime that should have been hated on rather than praised in order to convey a message to the industry that feeding clichés and lacking depth kills the story rather than enhances it. The confusing thing to me was that the majority of the audience actually enjoyed it. I’m not sure if it’s because the animation was simply beautiful, the actions scenes made the viewer nostalgic and hyped, or it hit the nerd cultures in the soft spots, but the second half and the lack of focus was definitely the banes of the show and made me want to cry
                  for not reaching its potentials. 
I criticize SAO because of the horrendous second half. It was a series where they tried to shove as much as possible into a ballon but the balloon can only fit so much tension before it pops. They should have expanded the first half since the stakes were high, the characters weren't completely developed, and there was so much left to explore. The additional ideas they could have explored on the top of my head are change in order and how humans interacted in a lawless society (big topics that breezed passed them). They did some cool things but it was brief (the assassin and the killers). I get the search for a relationship side for Kirito cause he’s a loner but they shouldn't have made it the prime subject. They should have done something similar to Avatar Korra where they had one season devoted to the struggle as an Avatar, another for the stakes, and now what happens after the immense change. 
As a director showing the audience a new world, it’s good to follow a prestigious standard story arch. Part 1: the development (more optimistic elements and characters constantly grow), Part 2: hits a darker turn (shit hits the fan and things become too difficult on a large scale for the protagonist), Part 3: change (how the resolve from the last problem effected people and how things can be balanced), Part 4 or End of Part 3: ultimate conclusion to the story. That was a brief idea of how the process works and I'm not saying that it should be copied but its a good bases to follow since so many solid mediums have done. Ex. Christopher Nolan’s Batman, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Indian Jones, etc (list of famous works go on). If you notice, the structure of this standard is also what many analytical essays are like. If they have at least done that then SAO would have been an AMAZING series but they FUCKED IT. They had a superb villain with a god complex, fresh out look at a lost idea (video games-> HACK series), and just so much to work with for the story and characters (psychology, economics, humanity, religion, change, sociology, etc of this new world). SAO is like a cook who was given high quality ingredients but made coleslaw.
How to Improve the Show
SPOILER WARNING:
The executive business man pedo crap with Asuna was a detrimental choice to the series since the first half established her as a strong independent character, but then changed into a damsel in distress aka objectifying women. The misogyny was obvious and created a down hillside to the series. The 2nd half's villain was force to be hated and the incest love complex was just cringing. The second half could have easily been fix by simply extending the first half.
The situation presented in SAO was something so many philosophers wish they could test, making a new world and watching how modern people answer to the conflict; restarting everything to observe the chaos and human development. An example of an interesting idea to explore would be like a powerful leader figure that guides the people in this predicament but then he's removed from the equation because the villain (god like being) kills him off. The story to take a dramatic turn, allowing the audience to see the unraveling of such a well established system. WHAT!?!?!?! IS COULD HAVE BEEN DONE? The guild was run by Kayaba Akihiko from the beginning. Let him fake his death during the fight with the boss on the 75th floor. No heir to throne and maybe his OP shield is left so everyone wants it and Kirito is feared for having it because he would be too powerful. So everyone becomes archaic, bringing the main characters into a dark turn of events. Heathcliff, Akihiko in SAO world, could been more charismatic, giving the viewers a reason to feel attached to the character. He could have been a mentor like character to Kirito where he would teach him how to be a leader and taking Kirito out of his secluded shell, creating an empathetic feel. A clash of ideals at the end would have been the epic climax everything built to, Kirito believing in humanity while Akihiko wields the latter. When Kirito wins the fight and debate, the Seed would have been that much more depth and reward to the series. That character development would have hit it home right into the gamers’ hearts. It would have been gripping and inspiring to all viewers.
Another issue SAO had was focus. ""Survival"" was the main task but it became more about Kirito's search for a people, primarily a girl. I liked how he started and found a group but then it was lost, but then it just toppled over. There were a lot of situations were some kind of life lesson was embedded somewhere in his harem adventures, but was that really that bit really necessary for the overall story. The emotions aren't from the actual event, but rather the girl's DISNEY EYES (making me feel tingly and protective. HAHA I'M ABOVE THAT). You get the intense setting by the stakes so to preserve their precious formula, they added little bits of struggle to make it looks like Kirito had character build, but it really digresses rather than supporting the main themes. I these episodes like OVAs or fillers when they had so much other material to work with. These shenanigans caused Kayaba(the bringer of the twist and purpose of SAO) to be a weak character since we weren't given much about him. Yes there are struggles, but like I said before. Themes are trivialized. We don't know him more than Heathcliff and his game. That's why I wanted more about the chaos or about the game itself. Under exploring SAO also means not really understanding who Kayaba is. If you've seen Indie Games the movie, you would get want I mean. A game is a medium of art and therefore a form of expression. You can clearly see that Kayaba did this for philosophical and experimental reasons. That was the conclusion but not the focus. It went off of what it was intended to do. During the fairy crap, I liked that the sister was part of the adventure but she was there for the wrong reasons. She was the drive Kirito used to continue fighting in SAO but when he comes out of the game, the viewers see siblings not really knowing each other, one-sided incestual love, and misconception. This creates a gap between such a central relationship which makes it feel like coming out of SAO that much less meaningful. I would like to also add Asuna's tentacle crap was cringing and the molestation scene was uncomfortable. Shock value creates emphasis. Lacking focus again. The shifts in ideas make the series feel scattered. The ending worked because of the intensity factor and it was one of the only good scenes because we get to see Kirito man up and dominate his oppressor. If you think about it, there isn't real build other than small events that are irrelevant from the plot. That's why I also mentioned that by exploring Aincrad makes the Seed more ionic than just some tool. The lack of focus created a blur of ideas in the series limiting the amount depth that naturally accumulates.
Ultimately, what I'm trying to say is that SAO was not thoroughly planned out. It was an OK anime but it’s not even close to its true potential. My example isn't the answer but its a huge improvement compared to what SAO is now. I’m putting so much weight on this show because it brought in such a large fan base into the Anime community. Giving SAO praise means that the industry won’t change and continue using this over used formula and Anime will still be seen as an immature medium. People must be more critical with what they watch in order to help improve work. Behind every great piece of work is a thousand failed attempts to make it and clearly SAO wasn’t given much thought.

                Welcome to Robert's Too Late Review! Working dub as usual. Today I imagine might be my first ever review with 0 'likes', one because I rate it way too high for the haters, and too low for the fans. But I have to call them as I see them, so to speak. If you want a quick of it, it's worth jumping into, though the second half of the season doesn't stand as well as the first. Let's jack in with our Nervgear and see what's going on!
Story: 7
I scored this one lower because, SPOILER HERE after they leave SAO for Alfhein a great deal
                  of the tension is lost. Yes Asuna is still in extreme danger, and the other 300 SAO players are being horribly experimented on, but without the fear of death in the main character, it loses a lot of its gut-punch. In the first half, when they are all in SAO together, and every wrong move meant permanent, real life death, there's an air of danger around everything they do. But once SAO is broken and Alfheim becomes the focus, the suspense drains from it. While the main female, Asuna, can still die if defeated in game, she's kept in a literal gilded cage to protect her. 
At one point the main character shouts to another in Alfheim that he won't let another party member die, not again. Well, problem here is that death is nothing more than an inconvenience. It might reset a few hours of play or respawn you further from the battle, but there's no 'real life' implications. In fact in Alfheim people regularly (including the main character) log out for real life obligations. I know the series was trying to replace the tension of every monster battle being their last in SAO with the urgency of stopping the evil bad company from doing their nefarious brain research. Just doesn't carry the same weight.
Another sticking point is that Asuna is to marry. She's in the same state as she was in SAO, along with the 300 other players. She cannot be removed from the VR gear or she'll die. She's still trapped in a virtual world. Even though her and the main character fall in love, some skeezebag decides (and arranges!) to marry basically comatose Asuna. Of course said skeezer is the master of Alfheim, of course. This means the main character has to infiltrate yet another world and save his beloved from yet another madman. The first time, great, the second time, it seems a bit tedious. 
Then there's the usual knock of incest Japan is so well known for. The main character's little sister (who in all actually is his cousin) has a thing for him and is initially jealous of his time playing games and even more jealous over Asuna. Using an avatar that looks nothing like her, and a username, she befriends her big brother/cousin in Alfheim and helps him in his attempts to rescue his beloved Asuna. In doing so, she realizes how much the main character loves Asuna, and realizes her feelings can be reciprocated (unless you live in Alabama!) so she makes peace with her feelings. 
As expected, the fights are awesome, and the main character is an utter badass. Asuna holds her own well, and the battles are over the top good. The fact that game death means real life death gives each encounter a dread that it could be the character's last. In fact, the show does not shy away from people dying in game, and therefore in real life. It's all pretty well done, except I would have put Alfheim somehow before SAO, as SAO has a bigger story impact. 
Art: 7
Even with the banging fights, I couldn't help but notice some cookie cutter characters in appearance. Take Sugu, Yui, and that guild chick that dies, and they are all basically the same character. Other than that complaint, everything does look good, and the sword and magic effects work well. 
Sound: 8
I adore all the opener and closers, and they sounds great. The voices never strain the ear, except perhap Yui. Since Yui isn't all that big of a support cast member, it's not so bad. Asuna's voice is perfect, and the main character nails it pretty well too. 
The background music is nice and well done, rising and falling as needed. The music fit the overall theme, SAO's background music conveys the tension whereas Alfheim seems lighter and less dire. The music is used effectively. 
Character: 8
The biggest complaint I have character wise deals with Asuna. She goes from a totally badass sword swinging warrior chick to basically a damsel in distress awaiting her 'prince'. I found her character arc in Alfheim to be a huge letdown from the ass kicker she was in SAO. 
The main character also takes this hardline stance on people dying in Alfheim even though it's NOT SAO. Death is not permanent, yet he flies around and fights like his life literally depended on it, which in SAO it did. But he takes Alfheim far too seriously. Yes, saving Asuna is the goal and all, but dude, chill a little. Also don't pick your starting race in an mmo without giving it any thought. 
The rest of the characters round out fine, and keep it interesting. I would have liked to seen more of the blacksmith that forges the main character his second sword, but oh well. 
Enjoyment: 8
I did really like my time with SAO. I plan to continue watching it. It doesn't deserve the hate it gets, but it's not also the  shining pinnacle of perfection either. Just a fun show, with some great elements built in. 
Best Girl: Asuna. Even if she weakens as the plot continues, she's still one hell of a badass, so that wins my vote every single time. Not to mention they draw her all cute too!
So ignore the haters, take a grain of salt from the lovers, and just enjoy this show for its own merits. It's not so bad, it's not the best ever, but it is a good time. Keep that in mind and everything should fall into place for you. Thumbs up! Now where's that damn logout button?",8

                When you really get down to it, Sword Art Online is a pretty generic anime. Most of what it does is pretty common to other mediocre shounen. I guess that the reason it has become so polarizing despite this is that it's a pretty extreme example of some of these things. So people who are into that type of show will love it while people who aren't will hate it.
On my end, I'm one of the people who hated it. For one, and there's no way to say this without sounding like a bit of a tool, I find the way gender roles are portrayed
                  in this and other anime like it extremely annoying. When women hit or abuse men it's used for comedy, which really reflects some hatred toward both genders. In this case it happens a few times in the relationship between Kirito and Asuna, but in fairness it's not all that common. It's more extreme about sexualizing its female characters and marginalizing their roles though, with a massive absence of anything equivalent from the guys, even for a shounen, sorry ladies. It gets to the point of being really creepy. Again, in fairness, it's deliberately creepy, but that doesn't make it any less unpleasant to watch. In a more thoughtful show some of that sort of thing might be alright if it were handled respectfully, but in this one it really just makes it a bit more painful to get through. Alternatively these aspects probably provide some fetish appeal, if you're into that, I suppose.
Obviously that sort of thing isn't the only issue I have with it. It's pretty weak in terms of characters and story as well. The root of the problem is that SAO is pretty purely about wish fulfillment so the protagonist is inexplicably great at everything, which is just painfully simplistic and unrealistic, and when combined with his being a bit of a dick makes him really unlikable. Meanwhile the female lead is a similarly idealized fantasy love interest who instantly falls in love with the lead. Which is a problem in and of itself. The romance is a huge, important part of the story, but it's really badly paced, with the two falling ridiculously in love pretty much as soon as they start seeing each other regularly. It really stops being about anything else once they do, too, and since the romance is so weak its domination of the story really drains the show of any entertainment value. It also has a problem of using a few pretty ridiculous scenarios to make the main characters succeed. It really comes to a point where the climax of each half of the story gets resolved with a Deus ex Machina.
There are a few good points, though. Before the romance takes over the story it's a bit more interesting. It gets a bit of mileage out of the premise by exploring the likely results of people being stuck in an MMO, and looks at a few minor characters who, while not particularly likable or interesting, are at least more so than the leads. The production values are also quite high and the fight scenes are good enough.
Basically if you hate anime like Fairy Tail, Naruto, To Love-Ru, etc. You'll probably hate this even more. But if you're into a wish fulfillment scenario like this one offers and want to see a girl showing a lot skin and getting sexually harassed then this will definitely scratch that itch. It'll be even better if you'd like to imagine yourself getting slapped around by your girlfriend a bit on your epic adventure.",3

                --NO SPOILERS PAST EPISODE 1--BIASED--TOTAL FAN BOY--OPINION--
This anime was simply amazing. I started this anime on a Sunday. Needless to say I had school the next day, around this time S.A.O. (Sword Art Online) had 9 episodes. I watched them all after instantly getting drawn in to this anime for its amazing concept. Not 100% original but nonetheless still a good concept. 
This story revolves around the main protagonist Kirigaya Kazuto (Kirito in game). As he enters Sword Art Online the worlds first fully virtual 3D RPGMMO. After spending some time in game he realizes an odd fact. He can't log out. As if the
                  first shock wasn't enough all the players receive a terrifying message from the games creator. ""If you die in the game, you will die in real life"" With this as his parting statement he tells them one more thing. That the only way to leave is to beat the game, which has 100 levels each with a end boss that increases its strength each level. 
This anime has the perfect balance with a strong lead, captivating episodes, graphics and just the right touch of romance that bound it together to make it one of the most amazing anime to be created.
This anime is 1 of my top and will be on the top for a long time to come. Watch it I 100% fully recommend this anime and if you have problem with me then we can take It up in anime court.",10
"
                The anime of virtual controversy, gamer paradise, and uncertain emotional investment - Sword Art Online. Helplessly overused comes the sudden thought, ""The premise of SAO is amazing, but the execution..."" from the vast horde of anime veterans, and a rebuke is rarely summoned as response. But SAO doesn't deserve the rage-filled abandonment of a supposedly betrayed and disappointed community; Sword Art Online, Season 1, deserves a Fair evaluation.
-Story-
Again, the premise issue arises, and a grudging admiration for the initial complexity and significance to the death game of SAO must be given. The world of Aincard is no pushover in the demands and sacrifices necessary for
                  story progression, and sacrifices are indeed the driving force behind the story development. However, the pacing of romantic, technical, and flag elements is barely decent; granted, the story is spatially patterned, but non-sequitur abruptness can only go so far. Many say that SAO's story cohesiveness falls apart after the first major arc, and I am in unfortunate agreement.
-Art-
The artistic element of SAO is its selling point. Characters are detailed and distinctive, and the backgrounds are pleasantly impressive, as if it were a subtle hint towards the genuine artistic and technical ingenuity of the world creator. The animations are consistent in quality and raw fluidity, lending well to whatever respective mood determined by the animators. There are little complaints towards the art of SAO.
-Sound-
It would appear that the sound for SAO is Fair enough. The OP/ED songs for SAO Season 1 is deliberate, and all other OST are understandable as to why they are inserted within the relative positions within the anime. Aesthetic interests in sound are relatively euphonious, and serves well as a casement for emotional juxtaposition with auditory senses.
-Character-
The portrayal and development of SAO's character cast are the issue and cause for the alleged betrayal of SAO enthusiasts. When there is little development to be seen (in the case of personality and mentality) for the protagonist, Kirito, throughout the entire season, it does not bode well for the rest of the minor characters. Some may argue that Kirito is even more standardized and static than his fellow gamers, and I remain undecided to that point. While not all are flat characters, SAO's players are, for the lack of a better description, simple and horrifyingly expressive.
-Enjoyment-
SAO lifted off of the mediocre levels of anime, but it just wasn't enough to hit the big names. It had an explosively fascinating premise and world (yes, a entirely new virtual world), and it is probably one of the best anime out of there that replicated a thin resemble to the unobtainable gamer paradise - all this is true. The thing that betrayed the expectant audience was not SAO itself.
No, the problem lies within the gamers that never really lived in the world they inhabited, in more ways than one.",6
"
                After watching Ga-Rei Zero, I was searching for an anime that had similar themes which is Action, Romance and Drama. I came across this anime. I thought at first it was going to be a weird anime but the show proved me wrong. From great story to great romance, it had what I wanted. 
SAO 1st arc (9/10)
Story: A 14 year old kid named Kirito bought a game called SAO along with the NerveGear. Only 10,000 copies were sold to the players and he's one of them. Kirito is a beta tester of the game so knew what to do once he entered SAO. Later
                  on, players found out that the log out buttons were gone. The developer did this intentionally and now these players have to clear all 100 floors to get out of the game alive. There's a twist though, once you die, you can't revive and you're dead. The NerveGear is also going to fry your brain once you die in game meaning you also die in real life.
Art/Animation: The Animation design was wonderful and well designed. Even the character designs are good
Sound: Whoever composed the soundtrack, great job to you. The soundtrack actually fits in the battle and most of the time, it gave me goosebumps. Especially the opening soundtrack. The best opening soundtrack I've heard yet. The emotional scenes had some pretty good soundtrack too
Character: A whole range of characters are going to be introduced in this arc. Kirito/Kazuto, the main protagonist of the show and a ""beater"" (beta tester/cheat). He didn't get a character development. He's somehow perfect from the start. They do explain why. Asuna, the supporting character of the show and later becomes the ""second-in-command"" for the Blood of the Knight Oaths. Silica, a supporting character and a beast tamer. She has a familiar called ""Pina"". Lizbeth, a supporting character and a blacksmith. Yui, a supporting character and an AI characters who happens to have human emotions and acts like a real human. She is a ""Mental Health Counselling Program"" Codename ""Yui"" designed to help players through a difficult time. Asuna and Kirito later became the in-game parents of Yui. I won't introduce the antagonist of the show. You'll have to watch the show.
Enjoyment: I truly enjoyed the show. I don't care what the SAO haters says, I'll never hate this. I can watch this arc all day and not get bored
ALO 2nd arc (6.5/10)
Story: 2 months after the SAO incident, 300 SAO Survivors along with Asuna has not woken up yet. Kirito received a picture from Agil. The picture shows of what looks like to be Asuna. Kirito got in ALO and decided to help her.
Art/Animation: It was pretty much the same. Not that I'm complaining or anything.
Sound: New soundtracks were introduced along with some re-used/improved soundtracks. Again, the soundtrack was amazing. The soundtrack never failed to give me goosebump. The opening soundtrack was good but not better than SAO's opening soundtrack. The ending soundtrack was a bit better.
Character: Only 1 supporting character was introduced in this arc along with many sideline characters that aren't that important. Suguha was introduced in this arc. She is Kirito's sister/cousin. While Kirito was still in SAO, Sugu found out that Kirito is not her real brother. She later fell in love him but got heartbroken after finding out that he is in love with Asuna. There's Leafa who is Sugu's avatar. 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed the first few episodes of the arc. After that, I was just shocked at the rape scenes. They showed it at least every episode until Episode 24. That's the reason why I didn't enjoy this arc as much as the SAO arc.
Overall (9/10)
One of the best anime's I've seen. It has one of the best stories out there and one of the best soundtracks. 
Pros:
-Great story
-Great characters
-Great soundtrack
-Great animation
Cons:
-The rape scenes",9

                *spoilers for a show that you’ve almost definitely seen by now*
prologue
Sword Art Online is perhaps one of the most unfortunate anime in existence. While it’s still a beloved gateway anime for new anime fans every year since it began in 2012, the international multimedia empire of SAO has been a derided one for almost half a decade now. Chances are, before even reading this review, you already feel that SAO is terrible or have at least heard dozens of arguments for why the series is horrible. It's such an acceptable target that even people who like shows that have all of the problems that this
                  show has and then some, still shit on it. However, there’s paradoxically little coverage centered on what I feel is the core of the show’s problems, at least as far as the first season and arc is concerned. 
SAO is not just bad because it features an unreasonably overpowered protagonist showered by an ever-increasing cast of spurned women who follow him and his OTP relationship around. It’s not just due to a dubiously crafted setting that left a whole lot unfulfilled. It’s not because of some of the mid-cour side stories that only exist to bring the wannabe lovers. It’s not even due to some of the most infamous, dubious, and poorly-presented plot points in the second half of the first arc and the entirety of the second arc rear their ugly heads, though you’ve likely put a pin in all of that like you should. Perhaps the most confounding aspect of SAO, why the first arc is generally more widely regarded compared to its successors while subsequently being one of the most corrosive disappointments, is how it leaves so many obviously compelling ideas criminally unfulfilled despite almost no one bringing them up!
Part 1: A Lukewarm Defense of the Aincrad arc being broken and disappointing on a macro level cuz people kind of ignore aspects of the show when shitting on it. This is what the review started as...holy shit, we are all fucked.
At its core, the first volume of SAO is a love story set in the backdrop of this expansive, fascinating sci-fi hellscape that’s far too big for just one light novel volume. As a result, the second volume was dedicated to side stories that introduced the bulk of who would ride Kirito and Asuna’s coattails in subsequent arcs as the two lovebirds went about being the protagonists of different stories. Perhaps not wanting to dedicate subsequent volumes to filling in the bible-length blanks the first one left behind in the subsequently dubbed AIncrad arc, and due to the author having new ideas, Reki Kawahara began SAO Progressive as a side-series to the main Sword Art Online cash cow. Sure, sometimes incrad could be revisited like in the murder mystery plot in volume 8 that makes up episodes 5 and 6, but those would mainly be flashback materials as the series moved on. 2 volumes were out for Progressive, and they probably wanted to sprinkle a little bit of that in for the anime, so episode 2 ends up being a condensed version of one of the Prog books. I bring this up both to address some of the disappointments some LN readers had, and to contextualize why the first arc is one of the worst-constructed stories put to animation. The second arc, Alphein, generally has all of the bases covered in terms of why people hate it, as will be discussed later. 
While the idea that SAO is one of the worst anime ever made --mainstream or otherwise-- is rather overblown, it’s not a stretch to call the first arc one of the most poorly paced and structured stories in the medium. So much of the season’s problems would be fixed by giving it some breathing room. The only problem is that the show was slated for just 2 cours and each arc ended up being around 1-cour each. This leaves no room to add anime-original episodes to space out certain plot points or even stretch certain mini-arcs past 1-2 episodes. This is most apparent in the 3rd episode when Kirito joins a small guild, feels nervous about revealing his powerful “Beater” status after Beta Testers start getting a bad rep, catches feelings for one of the members after a talk they had alone, and watches all of them fall prey to a death trap only he could escape before going on a small quest for an revival item that wasn’t worth it. 
Yes, all of that happened in a single episode. No, he does not express further hang-ups about it in the immediate proceeding episodes. This could have been a 3 episode arc where both he and we start getting used to these new characters before they’re taken away from us in the next episode and Kirito begins going on a fruitless journey that forces him to accept that he’s alone once again. Then we can spend an episode with him training, developing a reputation as a badass asocial (perhaps even antisocial) loner before side story encounters with the other girls and his eventual relationship slowly pull him out of it. Instead, he gets over it by the start of the next episode, offscreen, and goes from already kind of overpowered to downright absurd. The stuff with the guild and the first girl he fell in love with has almost nothing to do with the romance between Kirito and eventual soulmate, Asuna, moving forward. This is because the gap between episodes 3 and 4 is filled by one of the first arc’s myriad time skips. 
Let’s put this into perspective. At the end of episode 2, Kirito and everyone trapped in the SAO game that isn’t dead yet cleared the first of 100 floors. In episode 3, we’re already at floor 28, and when episode 4 rolls around, Kirito is already exploring an area in floor 47 for a side-quest. Each floor can house several forests, fields, and at least 1 town as far as we know, and it took a month + thousands of deaths for the first dungeon in floor 1 to be found, let alone beaten. The time between the first floor and the 28th in episodes 2 and 3 is 4 months. The 2nd half of episode 3 takes place in floor 49, over a year after the game launched. Keep in mind that episodes 4-7 are essentially side-quests introducing future pseudoharem members or only slightly progressing the relationship Kirito and Asuna (who was only introduced in episode 2 before coming back in episode 5) form before the last 7 episodes are focused squarely on their relationship and how they eventually clear the game while falling in love. On top of that, episode 8 skips to floor 74, further reinforcing that not only does progression only take place every ¼ of the game without any of it feeling earned or tangible, but that things just happen in this show with almost no semblance of pacing or connective tissue. On paper, spending a few episodes on side-quests that flesh out the world before getting back into the meat of things seems like a good idea. However, as established, we’re about halfway through the game at this point and Kirito has already undergone about half of his entire character arc offscreen. They won’t even be finished introducing characters via side adventures that have nothing to do with clearing the game at this point since the threat of escaping the labyrinthine hellhole that is this game has long since been exterminated like a large chunk of the player base.
Weirdly enough, most of the less plot-driven episodes show people making a living in these floors, almost as if they’ve come to terms with this being their life now. By episode 8, when we're finally back to the plot-driven excursions, it's actually confirmed. Entire cities are established and run by both NPCs and players alike. Sure, people still have an objective to clear, but even as early as episode 4, this has gone from a “trapped in a death game” setting to that of another MMO, the latter of which was likely what most of the game devs had intended. The only one seemingly exempt from this thought process is Kayaba, who has disguised himself by becoming the leader of the most prominent guild in the game, the Knights of Blood. They become the main group leading the charge to clear the game now that the whole idea of “those nasty Beaters” has been dropped by episode 6 and only gets mentioned whenever people talk about Kirito’s reputation. Kayaba or “Heathcliff” himself apparently wanted to see what happened after putting them in this hellhole of an MMO, at least until episode 14 has him say he hardly even knows why he did this beyond a vague memory of a castle beyond all laws in restrictions. In replicating that, we have Aincrad but the vivid image is still little more than a hazy memory. 
Theoretically, all of this could have made him a tragic character, one who was genuinely fascinated in creating the ultimate escapism platform where he could truly become the charismatic leader he was likely seen as during his career. Maybe his rockstar status in the game industry could have been something he wanted to keep and directly translate into something else. Perhaps we could have seen that ambition combined with the stress of working on this game during crunch periods for several years before his life came crumbling down and his control freak tendencies or some kind of character flaw to that effect drove him to trapping everyone, including himself, in his own creation. Perhaps over the 2-year span this arc takes place in, he gets so accustomed to life as a guild leader clashing with the guilt of being directly responsible for the deaths of thousands that he forgets why he created the game in the first place. This deadly simulation has turned into its own lived-in civilization complete with different cultures, anyway. Perhaps the weight of all of this could have made him seek someone he knows could kill him and end the game, turning him into the final boss he was destined to be once he knew Kirito was capable of truly challenging him and when he was eventually called out by said challenger.
This is a character we’ll never get to see in this show. Even subsequent appearances as a tech ghost effectively exonerate him as he helps Kirito overcome obstacles and generally gets referred to in a light that isn’t unilaterally negative. Eventually, Kirito himself is inspired to make a digital utopia akin to what SAO’s Aincrad world could have been, though that’s peering into SAO 2’s turf, meaning I’ve digressed for long enough. Still, perhaps the potential highlighted by this one scene was enough to burn people, make them feel like there was so much more to explore that was only hinted at in the end of this first arc. We’re just left with a bland twist villain who turned out to be the shady mastermind all along when, with a little more time to explore him and his guild, we could have peeled back the layers of his character as the seeds began being planted for this one big revelation. A relatively blank character is less frustrating than one who turns out to have all this potential backstory and depth at the last minute when it can no longer be explored. However, that’s Sword Art Online’s first arc in a nutshell. The first 4 episodes span 50 floors while the last 10 span 25 before the game ends prematurely. There’s a whole world that’s barely covered beyond the 6 or so side-quests that introduce characters who only gain their own varying degrees of relevance in future arcs. There’s a character beyond the protagonist who is constantly called a Gary Stu. There’s an interesting tragedy beyond the almost blank slate villain. There’s a lot here that gets skipped over because that’s what the novels did. Perhaps that’s why Progressive was made and why so many were looking forward to it getting an adaptation.
That being said, all of this implies that SAO wasn’t at least sometimes absolutely broken in the moment to moment, episode by episode viewing like it already is on a macro level. The devil is in the details, so it’s time to talk about what a miserable experience the show actually was on rewatch.
Part 2: The stuff everyone talks about when saying SAO is dogshit cuz on a scene by scene basis, SAO’s so bad you almost completely ignore the bigger picture disappointments and ideas the show had ⅓ of the way in.
The first episode showed some promise with solid direction and a clear idea for its main lead, Kirito. He’s reclusive and whenever he does want company, he wants it kept to just one other person as he values his life and that of whoever is immediately with them over any friends they might have. Then, episode 2 ruins all of it when he decides that despite there being an obvious skill ceiling for solo players in an MMORPG, he’s gonna distance himself from someone he hit it off with (Asuna) after not even trying to defend himself and Beta Testers from erroneous accusations of letting people die while they hoard all the boss and game knowledge. Even worse, he plays himself up as a villain for no good reason! This isn’t even all of the baffling decision making characters make in that episode. Remember the Beaters plotline that was introduced in this episode? This is what it’s all about: beta testers helping out newbies and getting the rug pulled out from under them by the devs, all the while being blamed for everyone’s deaths before Kirito says “your average beta tester was a pussy, I’m the real pro gamer” and subsequently being called a cheater until Beta Tester and Cheater became the silly portmanteau you probably forgot about until reading this review. Sure, you can argue that Kirito didn’t want Asuna strung along for the backlash, but he could have easily diffused the situation by pointing out the obvious instead of doing all of this.
4 months later, i.e the start of the next episode, Kirito’s asked to joining a 5-person guild with people he saved while doing something on his own, and accepts with only a hint of nervousness at joining an entire crew of people he doesn’t know after ditching someone who was likely willing to stick with him during the Beater backlash he instigated and watching Klein offer him the chance to join his guild with his friends and running away cuz he didn’t want much company. This is definitely a result of bad adaptation given that episode 2 was from the prog novels while this third one and the side-stories not major to the main romance or game are in volume 2 of the original LN. However, anime only viewers wouldn’t know that and would instead just see broken, wishy washy character writing as they give up and just call him a Gary Stu episode 4 onwards when he solos entire armadas of high-level douchebags and almost 1v1s entire bosses with either some or no help from others. Even episodes that aren’t riddled with nonsense, such as episode 3, fail due to the show’s god awful structuring and pacing. Those are the better episodes, by the way. The worst ones are definitely the likes of episode 2 and the bulk of the arc’s back half, where nonsensical decisions and ideas come about. 
One thing that is consistent about a lot of episodes, particularly in the first half, is that they never really know how to handle Kirito as a main character. Even outside of how wishy washy he is about companionship and guilds, he seems to be portrayed differently from episode to episode without much of a clear, defining aspect about him outside of how OP he is and will continue to be. He has a character arc but it’s almost entirely handled offscreen, as mentioned earlier. Otherwise, it’s hard to say he even has much of a character thanks to how inconsistent he is until episode 8 squarely lands him as the bland, milquetoast LN lead he’s solely remembered as. The only thing really separating him from most bland LN protagonist dubbed “Kirito clones” is that he’s still capable of experiencing a wild flurry of emotions and concerns from all over the spectrum, making him feel at least somewhat like a person capable of emotion and garnering empathy. Perhaps they should have combined episode 1 Kirito with episode 7’s smug, sassy asshole Kirito so that he’d be a consistent and likable character whose development was still tied to a well-defined core. 
The deuteragonist, Asuna, fares little better as while she is a reserved yet competent player in episode 2, the next time we see her in episode 5, she’s just some tsundere who hits and threatens Kirito all the time cuz tropes. Both mellow out of their most aggressive and snappy forms in episode 8, cementing Asuna as a tsundere while Kirito struggles to find something to latch onto in regards to settling down on a personality. They have almost no chemistry before really catching feelings for each other, let alone afterward, so there’s no reason to care about their romance. Keep in mind that this is the emotional core of the show once Kirito’s loneliness and eventual guilt for Sachi’s death are sorted out offscreen 3 episodes in, and that this is meant to be an extension to his character arc. Lisbeth, Asuna’s best friend, has more chemistry with Kirito in their weird pseudoromantic journey against a hideous CG dragon in a frozen hellscape in a one-off episode. 
As a matter of fact, Lisbeth’s easily the best character in this whole show despite only really appearing for one episode. She not only deals with the sassiest, douchiest Kirito yet, but despite her falling in love with Kirito is annoying on the basis of her becoming the 2nd accessory to the eventual romance he has with Asuna, her reason is far more interesting than Silica’s. Whereas the episode 4 girl with an S for a name and an “hit” to complete the description and depth of her character just kinda becomes attracted to him, Lisbeth simply wants something genuine in this artificial hellhole. As a result, she uses Kirito as somewhat of an outfit for it when she asks him to hold hands or when the sense of life and death adventure combined with her desperation for romance and something real beyond friendships quickly (and abruptly) makes her fall in love with him. Realizing he might already be taken due to Asuna having an earring and her making the admittedly unfounded in context but reasonable in a better-paced story connection, she tearfully comes to terms with that fact. It could have been better told, especially if this wasn’t the second time a side character became attracted to Kiribro in a one-off episode, but it’s still perhaps the most interesting on-screen bit of character development in this arc for the best character in it. She’s not even all that good thanks to the pacing, but she’s by far the most multi-faceted and interesting character this season that when contrasted with everyone else, she suddenly comes off like a Neon Genesis Evangelion character! At least, that was the case until the end of season 1/the end of the next arc undid the conclusion to her arc, but we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
The last one worth talking about to any extent is Klein. Barring some creepy moments in episode 1 and how he goes full Brock from Pokemon at every girl he meets, he’s also fairly alright. Wow, 2 for like 10 in the worthwhile characters department. He and Kirito have some decent chemistry at times and pops in to check up on Kirito and try to make sure he doesn’t go off the deep end before eventually just being there to have a side character be competent enough to give Kirito and Asuna a hand whilst doing nothing else beyond serving as comedic relief. The latter half of that sentence could also be applied to characters such as Agil, which is why it’s difficult to remember most of the show’s cast, let alone care about them in this badly laid out hellscape named Aincrad.
The worldbuilding in this arc isn’t that much better. 10K players is a low player base for even the first day of a game that had a premiere press launch and huge lines outside of stores. The idea that players have to touch themselves everywhere to calibrate the Nervgear gaming VR headset system and how it scans your IRL face even before that sounds like such a breach of privacy that it should have been a major scandal and a series of lawsuits that forced either the thing to be shut down or altered. The same goes for the idea that there’s a safety switch for the tech’s brain-frying microwaves that can be turned off! Already, as soon as episode 1, there’s quite a bit of suspension of disbelief to get over, and that’s when the narrative and character writing isn’t utterly nonsensical yet! Dungeon raids and boss meetings seem to only house like 30-50 people at most in a game where clearing all the floors is essential to escaping with your life. Kayaba forces everyone to play as their IRL selves, revoking their avatars, but apparently some characters like Lisbeth essentially dye their hair and effectively only barely resemble their real-life selves, anyway. Perhaps the most galling fact is that Kirito is the only character who can dual-wield in a sword-based video game because dual-wielding is a random unique skill instead of a feature relegated to certain playstyles. Nevermind how someone actually dual-wielded axes when fighting Kirito in episode 4, not that most people would notice. Why is this...a thing?! How could it possibly make any sense given what we know about the game? What kind of design is this?!
There are several other little inconsistencies and jarring details to go over but it’s honestly just not worth it.
There are other nuggets of lore and game mechanics sprinkled in that only matter to the episodes they come up in, like the idea that bad deeds turn the crystal hud above your head from green to orange and red. Currency is one such detail cuz it literally only comes up once in episode 8. However, that doesn’t really matter when as a game, this thing is a mess. It’s not even the kind people acknowledge is a shitty, broken game, and instead is just an extension of how bad this show is regarding its setting details.
Part 3: Everyone already knows why Alphein was a mistake so let’s try to make this quick compared to each part of the Aincrad discussion, oh god, what do you mean it’s 3 pages long?!
If nothing else, the Aincrad arc is certainly the more memorable of the 2 halves of this show. Despite its glaring issues, there’s so much to really dive deep into regarding the criticism of the show, which was why I felt like there were several aspects left barely touched by those who harp on the show. By contrast, the Alphein arc is a lot more forgettable, way less eventful, and a lot more well-covered in terms of its flaws. Part of why that is might be due to how despite having less awful pacing than Aincrad, this arc was downright ill-conceived, not even attempting to capitalize on any of the drama one would expect from watching characters recover from being trapped in digital hell.
Very quickly, the arc sidelines one of the most beloved female characters in the industry, turning her into a damsel in distress thrown in several unnecessary erotic and explicit scenarios. The infamous molestation scene in episode 24 goes way too far to make an already unlikable and uninteresting douchebag antagonist as evil as possible. Said scene is also the worst Berserk reference known to man as the Black Swordsman Kirito with a big sword is pinned down as forced to watch the elvish, long-haired bastard assault Kribro’s lover sexually. The new characters it introduces are somehow even less engaging than Kirito’s friends and sidepieces from Aincrad who don’t have jackshit to do here outside of Agil letting Kiribrony know where to go. The final confrontation between Kirito and resident douchebag villain, Sugou, is downright laughable. Any PTSD or trauma from being trapped in Aincrad for about 2 years is reserved for one dream sequence in episode 15 before being relegated to season 2 in favor of an ill-conceived “rescue the damsel in distress” plot. You’d think that after seeing Kirito pick up habits from what his cousin/”sister” can only assume is the 2-year coma game, they’d at least talk about it. Nope.They’ve only had 2 months and the only thing she knows about his experiences is that he got a gf that’s stuck in the hospital for reasons neither of them know at the start.
The actual plot of this second arc is set in another VRMMO, this time run by the Nervgear's successor: the Amusphere. It takes place a couple months after Kirito had just escaped a game that kills you if someone removes the Nervgear headset or if you find yourself receiving an in-game death. Why would Kirito willingly agree to head into another one of these, let alone this soon and with no hesitations or trauma? Why are these games or a successor to the certified brain cooker allowed to be made, especially this soon? Rescuing Asuna isn’t valid enough as an excuse to completely ignore all of this when this could have been about exploring his current traumas, what made him become reclusive in the first place, and how he and Asuna have to adapt to having their relationship be in the real world while both dealing with the post-SAO trauma. Episode 4 even has Kirito expounding about how his grandfather beat him for quitting kendo as a kid and how his sister worked extra hard on it for the two of them ever since. Perhaps that could have something to do with his initial disposition, but we’ll never know as what we’re left with might just be the worst way to follow up the events of Aincrad.
Outside of Kirito’s IRL time with Sugu, Asuna, and info-broker Agil, the first half of the arc is barely even worth mentioning as it features a conflict between different in-game races that gets resolved in about 6 episodes, featuring boring planks of wood that are barely, if at all, relevant afterwards. They barely explore this far less interesting setting after the first 6 episodes because then we have a plot with actual character arcs and things happening to contend with. The 2nd half is about Asuna’s fruitless escape attempts because they don’t wanna completely downgrade her, just mostly. It also features Kigitalboy’s cousin, Suguha, and how she struggles with catching feelings for who she doesn’t know is his in-game persona. We’ll get back to this subplot and why it sucks. Then, he climbs a big tower, loses to a seemingly infinite armada of high-level NPC soldiers, then wins cuz his sister and her friends showed up in the next episode. I guess it’s the first time he has a genuine loss and not just losing in a recreational duel against the main antagonist of the first arc who was literally invincible. Then, the awful stuff with creepy rapey Sugou happens and everyone lives happily ever after until the sequels upon sequels flood in because the hype train ran over the cash cow and dead horse a long time ago but they’re still attached to the front of the locomotive that refuses to crash.
There are also some general issues that I feel should be covered about now as they pertain to this arc, as there are still a few major issues left to cover, believe it or not. The first thing is the comedy. Sword Art Online can tell a funny joke once in a while when the gag is predicated on the 2 character dynamics that have any chemistry whatsoever. However, a lot of the jokes are either dull or just flat-out shit like “the best friend is kind of a creeper” and “MC accidentally grabs girl’s boobs and gets fucked up”. This also leads into another issue, which is that SAO is actually kinda dull and whatever once you look past all the broken bullshit and particularly upsetting moments. There’s not much character chemistry, there’s not a lot of compelling drama since it’s all either rushed or placed on ill-conceived ideas, the jokes are a wash, and there’s not much in the way of stakes past the initial episodes. The show is very emotionally manipulative, but it isn’t very expressive or even that good as a title to watch for the spectacle --more on that later--. SAO isn’t the most laborious thing on the planet, but it’s not fun to watch or very interesting of a trainwreck cast beyond the complex web of world-building and structuring issues. There aren’t too many decisions in the writing that come off as so absurd that they become a reason to watch the show or even serve as compelling vent material. As discussed earlier, the show’s characters are nothing to write home about beyond the inconsistent handling of the MC and how many are abandoned. There’s the absolute mistake that was Yui, but all she did was make the show a little more cloying and narratively broken. 
The two big problems for this arc beyond the idea of it in context of what came before are as follows: Suguha and sexualization. Suguha is in love with her cousin/”brother”, Kirito, and feels hurt about him distancing himself from her several years ago. The significance of these two things is in the order listed. Every single episode of this arc prior to the last two have her constantly angsting about her suppressed romantic feelings for Pretty Colors Kigibro, usually complete with several fanservice shots because the show has decided that sexualizing her in every other scene just wasn’t enough. I mean, it’s been pretty adamant about executing fanservice shots and scenes for almost every single female character, regardless of if it made sense for any given scene, so why not? It’s not like the repetition of these two things is absolutely exhausting and that there are more interesting things to be focusing on, like how she’s still wounded about Kigi shutting himself off. While we were told about him doing this in the past several times throughout the show, we only learn of how that affected her when the arc comes to a head in episode 22. It’s interesting to learn of this from her perspective, but it should have been a much bigger focus, as should Kirito’s home life prior to and post-SAO incident. Instead, here’s this problematic arc that gets dragged out for 9 episodes before a small duel ends the thing with the two of them hugging out, surprisingly without the camera ogling her in her G-cup Leafa form.
That said, the camera’s still not as perverted as Sugou or his guards. Yeah, it’s time for the moment you’ve all been waiting for. The most defining albatross around Sword Art Online’s neck is its rape attempt and molestation scenes. They often feel so forced and over the top that you either have to take them seriously and be disgusted, or not take them seriously cuz you’re laughing at how juvenile the presentation is. Rape is a rather delicate tool for media to use, as it marks the point of no return for a character that enacts it, and requires a lot of tact and purpose. It can’t feel like it’s just an excuse to fetishize a female character while making an already horrible person turn irredeemable because the writers didn’t think they were awful enough. Sugou’s slimy guards tentacle groping Asuna’s entire body in episode 21 is very much a case of the former, and Sugou himself doing it to her in front of a pinned down Kirito is an example of both problems. It’s even worse as these are the only particularly significant scenes involving Asuna barring her being comatose and her reuniting with/kissing Kiri-nee. That said, perhaps more offensive than the scene itself is how it’s resolved by a Deus ex Kayaba giving Kirito admin privileges and the SAO source code to upload from beyond the grave in order to beat the shit out of Sugou and edge ever closer to that coveted Gary Stu title.
Let’s actually end this entire discussion with Sugou himself. He’s a maniacal rapist bastard who digitally kidnaps 300 players for psychological torture experiments so he can find a way to enslave people’s souls and conquer everything. He has a god complex and wears it on his sleeves. He’s already so evil that making him a rapist seems like overkill. It’s rather difficult to take this clown seriously whenever he slips into that side of himself or whenever he’s on screen for the last two episodes. There’s nothing really interesting about him, and he’s not even hammy or otherwise entertaining as an evil for evil’s sake kind of villain. He’s just boringly, putridly bad in a show that’s every bit as awful as him.
Part 4: This show isn’t even that good from an audiovisual perspective, oh also epilogue. Jesus tapdancing Christ, this thing is over 6K words long! How the literal and metaphorical fuck did this happen?! Why? WHY?! W W W W H H H Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y ? ! ? ! ? ! ? !
Sword Art Online --both this season’s production and that of all subsequent installments barring the GGO Alternative spinoff at the time of writing-- was spearheaded by A-1 Pictures. A-1 isn’t exactly a studio people herald for their visual prowess, and this show isn’t exactly one of their best on that front, either. There are some explosive bits of sakuga here and there, as well as a few shots that look fairly decent. The art direction in some locations in Aincrad is also neat, with fairly abstract-looking dungeon and boss room designs and particularly nice sunset views on occasion. That being said, a lot of the fight scenes are mediocre to terrible, with episode 2 being the absolute worst of it. Spark effects often stutter, animation fluidity during fight scenes is absurdly inconsistent, and the choreography is so weak that there’s almost no sense of weight or physicality to attacks. That’s one of the main reasons the fight scenes are almost never entertaining, the other reason being the generally 7th grader fanfic tier quality of writing on display. SAO is just a very inconsistent-looking show with lopsided animation and artwork quality, and the decent amount of god awful CGI, reused animation, and awful shots don’t exactly help.
On a more positive note, the show does have some solid music. Yuki Kajiura was the composer for the show, and while this isn’t her best OST --not even close-- it still contains several solid tracks. “A Narrow Escape” is the most exciting and tense theme in the show, while tracks such as “Swordland” and “we have to defeat it” serve as similarly compelling pieces for the show’s action scenes. Other tracks such as “at our parting” and “she is still sleeping”  are also effective emotional pieces. The show does tend to reveal more of its best tracks after the first ⅓ of the series, although there are some gripes. Towards the end, some of the tracks feel misused in the scenes they’re in, and the 2nd arc spams “with my friend”, the piece used for the bulk of the show’s comedy scenes, to an absurd degree. Still, the OST is fairly solid, and so are the show’s OPs. “Crossing Field” by Lisa is a solid Jpop song that is deserving of its iconic status, especially thanks to the lovely beginning passage it has. “Innocence” by Aoi Eri is another solid OP, though it’s slightly weaker than the first one. The EDs are ok sad girl pieces, but nothing worth noting either. 
Huh, you’d think there’d be more to talk about given how monolithic the talk of the show’s writing was.
I can't hate SAO, but I also cannot enjoy it. It's not the worst mainstream anime out there, not even for A-1 Pictures nowadays, but at best, it’s prime rewrite material with the endless amount of missed potential on display. It’s so absurdly broken in several different and complex ways depending on the arc that it’s no wonder the series has endured as the community’s resident punching bag for almost a decade. I just wish people would look a little deeper to see what the show could have been and what was actually right in front of them before blindly tearing the show to pieces and giving a pass to other shows with a lot of this series’ problems. 
So, essentially, this is just another negative SAO review to add to the pile while you watch SAO Abridged or pray for the Progressive anime to be any good. Fuck Painting Blade of the Interwebs.",3

                Story:
- it's so-so,  between siimplistic and complex, and if you're a gamers too, so it will be easier to understand about this anime.
- the first 14 episode are really good to me personally, episode 15 and the rest are quite dissapointed for me, because I don't really like the changed.
Art:
SAO has a good Art that really fit to the story, and the background is awesome work.
Sound:
The Op and Ed OST is really enjoyable, suited so well with the story.Character:
all of main and supporting character are created well, especially the equipment and heroine (of course, lol)
Enjoyment:
I do really enjoy this anime, it's because this's the best anime that bought game theme (at least that's what I think).",9

                SAO is something special. There have been lots of Animes which are related or are about games in this kind of form. But in my opinion Sword Art Online is the best of them. Well, the first episode was kinda boring at first, but after that episode everything starts and you just can't stop watching. All you want to do is watch it. 
The thing that I love about this anime is that it's not always like you can tell what's going to happen. This anime surprises me each episode :D
I think it's more than worth watching. 
Everyone who like animes like Accel World and
                  other game animes should definitely watch it, because not only the story is amazing, also the art is outstanding. Asuna is beautiful and I totally fell in love with Kirito :D",10
"
                This anime is probably a fan favorite, but honestly this is a disaster!
Pros:
The world of SAO and the depth of this virtual reality is pretty awesome! The main character is pretty cool, he is strong, somewhat passive. His swords though are incredible, in design and strength?
Cons:The plot was not there at all, it was sooooo un interesting. The goal was not survival nor wining the game, instead the players focused on giving up and settling there in the virtual reality. 
With the main female character, and the ""daughter"", it felt like I was watching a barbie commercial, it was fucking cute, boring, lovey-dovey stuff, which I did not care for.
The time progression was another disaster, I believe on the third episode the main character was already a legend and the strongest players in the game, and he went from level 1 to 60 something in like 3 episodes. but, we never saw him fight to gain strength or practice, all he did was dream and sleep. WTF!!
Dislike this series so much and the fans it got, because honestly there is no real story here. I give SAO a 4 and would NOT recommend!
Watch BTOOM! instead!",4
"
                SAO is an anime I honestly had high hopes for. As a sci-fi fan and veteran gamer myself, the whole revolutionising the gaming industry thang SAO had going for it was a genuinely intriguing one to me, and I was hyped as hell at the end of the first episode. Of course eventually, SAO blew up in my face; and all I could do was seriously rue upon the fact that something with so much potential, had been messed up so badly by cheap characterisation, a writer's block midway and a sudden dip in thrill factor.
The first arc of SAO, or the first 14 eps,
                  were the only part of this series that I actually liked. That feel of a deceptively beautiful, dangerously crafted, Unreal Engine 20.0 world was there, well drawn, animated and illustrated; with a fantastic score to go for it as well. As a gamer, I felt the need to be part of such an experience, but I also felt that danger through my screen. The whole ""Kirito vs 99 bosses"" thing was fun as well, and I actually liked the ending to the arc. Sure, most of the sad scenes didn't work out due to terrible, shallow characterisation (more on that later), but the feel SAO gave out papered over the obvious cracks rather admirably. Had it ended here (a proper ending), I'd have given SAO a 6 or 7, just for that experience it provided.
But it truly became utter bollocks after episode 14.
The second arc was terribly atrocious, that's about as politely as I can put it. First we get a really stupid looking world called Alfheim, which is nowhere near as badass as the first world; its entire atmosphere just sucks. The characters get even more terrible here, and without an immersive world to cover for them, everything spirals out of control for poor SAO. An added incest plot turns the show from faeces to a bloody stinking sewer, and there's literally nothing left to savour any longer. Everything bad from the first arc came straight here in full glory, together with the extra flopping additions to truly produce a foul concoction. I found myself wishing and crying inside for an end, simply because I couldn't just stop an anime halfway. The end came, thankfully, and compared to the horrible episodes that led to it, it was actually pretty decent. 
Characterisation, the thing I value most in every series alongside story, is terrible in this one. Horrendous. While it was bad in the first arc, the plot still progressed, and there were times where certain character combinations made for interesting episodes; and due to the constant flow, the irritating lack of depth for each one never made it to the surface that easily. Kirito the protagonist, is easily one of the worst MCs I've ever seen. Good at everything for no reason despite being a zero personality wise, getting ALL (yes, every frogging girl in the show) the girls despite having the sociability of a rock, and being so inconsistent emotion wise...he's a disaster. Asuna, decent at times, but overall just a female version of Kirito made just to complement him. The other characters lack any exposure whatsoever, so I'll save my time. SAO's main problem is, whatever it's characters have, they have it, JUST CAUSE.
Well that's that for SAO. Buckets of potential, splashed down a sewer, that sums it all up. The only reason it even gets a 4, is because of that first arc. That one part endeared me to SAO, even though I'm not at all enthusiastic to continue with any other adaptation of SAO. Wouldn't recommend it to those wanting a good, sweet anime; but if you're an ultra gamer, or if you're looking for JUST predictable entertainment; SAO will be alright to watch.
Final: 3.5/10, rounded off to 4.",4

                I think that it can easily said that Sword Art Online is an incredibly polarizing show. Many people consider Sword Art Online to be the best anime of all time while others would rather regard this show to be utter trash. Looking at this show in a more critical lens would show that there are plenty of merits coming from both camps however, in my opinion the number of flaws just outweigh the positives.
Art: Starting with the positives, I don’t think that it can really be argued that this show looks very good. Characters are well designed and are animated well. Action scenes in particular
                  are especially flashy and really craft some memorable moments. The only occasions when the art quality was in question would be the use of CG. Whenever incorporated, the CG parts would stand out awkwardly and not mesh well with the action occurring around the CG. 9/10
Sound: The sound of Sword Art Online is also top notch. Background music is fitting and atmospheric, the voice actors do an impressive job pouring emotion into their characters’ words, and special praise for both openings for being amazing. 10/10
Story: This is where things get very messy. The show does hit the ground running with an extremely compelling concept. The story involves thousands of players who have just logged into a new virtual reality massively multiplayer online role playing game (VRMMORPG) realizing they have been trapped in this virtual world with no means to escape other than to beat the game. The show however seems to forget the fact that it was trying to tell a compelling story after the third episode as the plot diverts into a slew of romance sub-plots that not only feel forced but also pointless as they ultimately serve no purpose other than to pad the show with more cute girls. Then when the show remembers that it needs to actually progress the arc abruptly ends. The game of Sword Art Online is completed and it comes out of nowhere only to have a second arc begin right away with a significantly less interesting damsel in distress storyline. 3/10 
Characters: For all intents and purposes there is only one character really worth talking about and that is Kirito. Kirito starts off likeable enough. He’s somewhat shy but is willing to help anyone who needs it. At least, Kirito is in the first episode. From that point on however, Kirito really loses a majority of his personality in favor of just acting like a badass. Now this isn’t a bad thing in principle. There are plenty of beloved characters that are badasses. Kirito, however, is a badass for all the wrong reasons and that’s because everything is just handed to him with no explanation. Every girl falls inexplicably in love with Kirito, Kirito just happens to have the ability to dual wield though it’s unknown if this skill was even programmed into the game since no one else has this skill, and worst of all time skips were used to just get Kirito to the point where he completely over-leveled even though he’s a solo player that should have a really hard time surviving in high level regions. Every other character can honestly be summed up in a phrase since either they get next to no screen time or they lose all sense of personality at some point. Asuna is the tsundere, Klein is the goofy sidekick, Agil is strong and reliable, Silica is the loli, Yui is the more annoying loli, Oberon is the comically evil guy and it goes on. 2/10
Enjoyment: I won’t lie. After a certain point I found myself getting angry at this show more than I was enjoying it. Some of it has to do with the derailing story and complete lack of complex characters but I think most of it has to do with the fact that this show promised a story about a VRMMORPG and it never actually felt like a game. As a game what can actually happen is limited to what is possible to code and you want me to believe Kirito can just pull dual wielding out of nowhere. You want me believe that Kirito is capable of collecting the best loot and being by far the strongest player in the game even though he fights solo and shouldn’t have the means to fight the stronger mobs. You want me to believe that these people who went out to buy Sword Art Online on the day of release are really insane enough to turn into cold-blooded murderers and become PKers. As someone that has quite a lot of experience in MMOs I could say these things do not happen. So without the video game gimmick keeping me interested this is just any other fantasy show. 2/10
This show could have been great. That’s what makes me feel somewhat sad to see how Sword Art Online has turned out. What we are left with is a below average story with uninteresting characters wrapped up in a package of great sound and animation. If anyone really does want to watch this show I suggest just turning your brain off and just watch the pretty fight scenes.",4

                Sword Art Online
When I came across this anime whilst randomly looking for another show to watch, the synopsis caught me. I am a gamer and enjoy RPG, so naturally I quickly developed an interest to this series. The first several episodes caught my attention and the premise that you were trapped in the virtual world and in order to survive meant immersing yourself in this reality had me fascinated. The action scenes dropped my jaw right down to the floor and kept me wanting, wishing and anticipating for more action. Sadly the story, the plot and the characters lost their purpose and solid direction. I
                  found myself becoming less interested in the dialogue/plot and more anxious for another boss fight. 
Character and Plot Development. (3) The first four episodes created the atmosphere and struggles with the terms/challenges of survival within a virtual setting. It had that high danger element (killed in the virtual world = death IRL), gaming terms, boss battles and the development of a dark, mysterious plot. Later episodes developed odd time skips, episodic and pointless missions and a romance/partnership that though cute and at times innocent on the exterior, yet on the interior was childish and forced. Kazuto, the male lead embodied the hopes and dreams of all male gamers and fangirls by being good-looking, attracting every female gamer in this reality, every girl gamer needing his help and being overpowered beyond belief. Asuna, the female lead also embodied the hopes and dreams of all fanboys and female gamers by being cute, innocent, a bad-ass (when she wanted to be) having great cooking skills (literally) and needing being the perfect girlfriend. Whilst this annoyed the shit out of me thinking of this lazy-ass method to create these characters. It can also be mentioned how astute this series is in reaching its target audience by tempting us with our guilty pleasures and images of the ideal ""gaming"" life. (This sounds really sad) By doing this they've diminished the danger element and discarded the interest in the plot as you are addicted to the ideal of the gamer identity, not the individuality of the character or the story unfolding. 
Art, Sound and Action. (9) Clearly the best aspects of this anime. The music is grand and epic in emotion creating the drama and struggle during a boss battle. Eye and ear gasms, truly a wonderful spectacle complimented by the wonderful art. A particular feature that really impressed were the use of colored highlights from sword power-ups and attacks, adding to the feel of a environment. May this series an enjoyment to watch.
SAO is its own worst enemy. In the quest for the perfect anime, they created lead characters with unrealistic traits and little individuality; a plot underdeveloped and rushed and the demise of its danger element (demeaning its survival needs). But it does get some things right, like the action (its boss fights), use of gaming terminology, music and art style. SAOis worth a watch but should not be taken seriously as it is a B-grade action flick. If you wanted a solid story and characters, it may not be what you are looking for...",6

                When I was first watching sword art online, it had this magnetizing effect to attract viewers. Well because it was an idea of a VR-video game, and it's something that we want ourselves to actually experience. The idea was just gold, because it made the first arc completely original in my point of view. It was the fact that the first episode made the problem clear and it caught our span of attention. The first 13 episodes were just amazing for me because it was an idea of actually living in a world without magic, this new idea that made it intriguing. Everything else was
                  great except for the story in my opinion. What I didn't like is that they threw in another problem in the fairy arc. Anyone had the feeling that the experience of watching SAO was more magical without the magic? then the magical feeling of Watching SAO just vanished when they implemented magic?",8

                I am an avid fan of anime (specifically adventure-fantasy-action) and games, and so, when an anime like Sword Art Online came out, I was stoked. I was excited. I waited in high expectations because finally, an anime that will make my dreams come true, is here. Also, I was running out of fantasy-adventure animes to watch because I have watched most of them already. Finally, a new one is here.
I am writing this review now, because I've attempted to finish this anime four times, and failed all times. And never will again, try.
For a lover of adventure-fantasy animes, this anime is an insult. Why? The
                  adventure I was looking for, wasn't there. Yes, the art is good, the places are good but I expected an ADVENTURE. I expected them to go places and kingdoms but no. Sadly, I didn't feel any adventure in it, though the settings change. 
The action I saw in this anime was the blandest. Fight scenes made me yawn. There are no strategies whatsoever, unlike the games we play in. Kirito just ran toward the enemy and TA-DA! He wins. Because he wield dual swords suddenly, in the middle of the fight, with apparent no reason why. Just because.
The story, I didn't get it. I mean, it's there, but somewhere along the way, it just appeared to me that the anime is just a big show of FANSERVICE. Nothing is happening. The pacing is so horrible. The expositions are so weak. Characters who you thought were introduced as smart, apparently needs someone to blurt the information out before they realize it. 
The characters are non-existent. They all exist just to cater to what the audience wants to see. Male audience. Kirito is just a tool for the guys to project themselves into, and the female characters were every man's dream. I was so confused about their characters. How could I possibly love characters if they don't have one? I would have loved if the writers made an outline. The character fluctuations are intense as hell! One episode, Kirito's a badass, the next, he is so weak. And then suddenly, with one hit, he kills a boss who almost killed him with one hit just because a ""Dual Sword"" menu appeared flashing on his right side. How amazing... 
And because they don't have solid characters, there were also no character progression. They just fluctuate. 
I was so stressed watching this anime that I had to drop it. I didn't enjoy it, at all. For an avid fan who loves adventure and fantasy and action, for an avid fan who tries to see the good in every anime, for an avid fan who just tries to enjoy the anime and criticize less, this is the worst anime ever. I couldn't handle it. It destroyed everything.
It had a good something at the start, but somewhere along the way, it ran off road, then off the cliff, tumbled down onto some rocks on the way down, and died down before reaching the ground. 
I was so disappointed, to the point that I have to write this review.",1

                Sword Art Online: the anime with perhaps the most controversial reviews on MAL. At least from what I've seen, there really isn't much of a middle ground with people's opinion on this show; the people who love it profess it to be a masterpiece while those who hate it hate it with a passion. Personally, I think the show was overhyped, but it's not terrible, but somewhere in the middle of the two. Please note that I'm not being moderate just for the sake of it, this is truly what I think of the show. But enough about my opinions on other people's opinions, and
                  on to the actual review.
WARNING: Mild-major spoilers below. Do not continue if you have not seen the anime yet and want to remain spoiler-free.
Story-(6/10): There are two things that really prevented SAO from being as good as its fanboys/girls constantly try to remind us it is: the inconsistencies in the pacing, and the random addition and subsequent shoving aside of new characters (which will of course be discussed down below). The first story arc in Aincrad had a good but not great story line, which was really nothing special. What really grabbed me was the concept and how well it was done. Yes, I know it's not original, but the way the rules of the game worked and the game constructs were something I found very cool and unique. The problem here was with the pacing. The story progressed very quickly for how much was actually shown to be completed, until the 1 maybe 1.5 filler episodes before picking up for the final boss battle. Then after the game was completed, the show slowed down immensely as more was shown outside the world of VMMO's. The show became more focused on drama with the new game Alfheim Online as a plot device used to perpetuate some of it. In short, the series strayed away from what made it good in the first place, and it really put a dent in the quality of the show. Even so, the second arc wasn't entirely bad, and it was kind of unavoidable to create the same plot conditions that made the first arc good. Unfortunately, the storyline was just handled poorly.
Art-(10/10): The art of SAO is the one thing that most people here could agree on. The scenery was incredible to look at, especially many of the minute details. Of course what most people enjoyed about the show were the battle scenes, which were well-choreographed, and the entire show had superb effects in and out of battle that really brought the game to life. There isn't really much else to say on this matter other than well done to the animation team.
Sound-(9/10): The sound was another very well-done aspect of this show. The voices were all pretty good but were overshadowed by the sound effects and music, which were what really stood out to me. Both of the openings and endings were catchy enough for me to seek out the full versions and I liked all four of them. The great thing about the music in SAO was that it always perfectly matched the scenery and what was going on, whether it was the town music, the nice emotional music, or the epic battle scene music.
Characters-(5/10): This is another of the show's big downfalls. The main characters undergo almost no development at all. Kirito progresses a bit when he realizes he can't do everything himself and finally figures out how to use teamwork, but that's really about it. Asuna was a huge problem for me. I find it oddly irritating for her to have gone from badass blade warrior ""Lightning Flash"" to the near-helpless damsel in distress ""Titania"".  While the plot accounts for this discrepancy fairly well, it just bothers me to no end. Unfortunately, that's not even the biggest problem with the characters. Pretty much all the minor characters are one-sided and static, including Suguha, Klein, etc. Then there's the problem that most people have come to notice: the focus a whole episode on characters like Silica and Lis, only to have them tossed aside with one or two cameos until the final episode. In a show where the characters lack development, one would think it would be beneficial to add more personalities to create more diversity, but it seems the plot has prevented that from happening.
Enjoyment-(9/10): Despite all these flaws, I had a fantastic time watching this show. It was fun, (mostly) exciting, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The show entertained me and kept my attention almost the entire way through. If anything this anime shows that good story and characters aren't everything. But to allow this to be a factor in the final score would be unfair considering how poorly the show did in other areas, so I'm leaving it out.
Overall-(7/10): Like I mentioned earlier, the show is good, but not great. It's sad to think that this show could have been much better. I imagine that this leaves seasoned anime watchers as the most disappointed while the newer viewers tend to be the least harsh. In the culture of anime, I think that SAO would actually function best as a starter show, or one to introduce some one to the world of anime. It's good enough to keep people wanting more, but once they get more, they will realize that there is so much better out there. Hopefully SAO II will fix the problems that season 1 had and be even better.
P.S. This was my first review, so I hope you guys found it insightful or whatever you read it for. If you didn't like it and take my opinion with a grain of salt, then I'll do the same with yours. Thanks for reading!",7

                [THERE WILL BE SOME VERY MINOR SPOILERS]
TL;DR? Summary in pros/cons format at the end for those who want a quick idea of the series.
This is my first review.
Ah, Sword Art Online... Easily the most famous anime of 2012, it manages to remain high on the popularity charts even today. I went into this anime with a pretty open mind, with my expectations kept lower than what such popularity would warrant, given how popular anime tend to be a tad overrated... but nothing could prepare me for the monstrosity that is SAO. 'Overrated' is too nice a word to describe this one. I'll go into the
                  specifics from here.
Story - 1/10
Yep, a 1/10. You'd be wondering how a story can be so bad that it would deserve such a score and I'd tell you this - If there was an option to give a zero, I would have gladly picked that instead.
SAO happens in a Virtual world, or specifically, in a game. Those who have followed the .Hack// series would know that this setting is fairly common, if not overused. Even then, it's still acceptable, since many surprisingly good anime have turned up in recent times, which make used of very clichéd settings. After introducing this setting, they proceed to announce that all the players of this game are trapped there... once again taking hints from .Hack//. 
What follows is nothing but a mess. You have jarringly random time skips, sudden character developments that have nothing to do with their behavior so far and the worst of it all, a pathetic attempt at romance. About 90% of the story just focuses on making Kirito look cool (I have a lot more to say about this in the 'Characters' section)
On the whole, the story of SAO is boring, predictable and downright annoying at times. Convenient plot devices are the heart of this anime.
Art - 7/10
Literally the only good thing about SAO. Good backgrounds and fight scene animations, but I'd say that the character designs were somewhat lacking. There were some huge flaws though, such as Asuna's birdcage, which I'm sure I don't need to explain further.
Sound - 5/10
Nothing really stood out. I don't really watch anime for the visuals or soundtracks/music, so I don't have much to say about the two.
Character - 1/10
The absolute worst point of this anime. The greatest issue I had was with the protagonist, Kirito. Just about every single character in SAO except Kirito exists simply to make Kirito look cool. They're all used in various ways JUST to show that Kirito is better than them. EVERY female character exists to be rescued by him (and promptly fall for him/revere him) and every male character exists to lose to Kirito in some spectacular manner (and then for it to be revealed that Kirito was holding back his power, as expected). All this would have been bearable if Kirito had at least been an interesting character, but NOPE - he's blander than your average digestive biscuit and just about as emotionless as your average brick. In short, he's your average harem anime protagonist... maybe a little below average, even as harem anime leads go. For this sort of a character to get so much screen time already kills the show - and then come the other characters, basically to add insult to injury.
The female lead of SAO, Asuna, is another copy-paste character. Just your average Tsundere with absolutely nothing new to bring to the table. Thankfully, she receives very little screen time in the second half of the show (though the tentacle scene was what completely made me hate this anime)
For lack of any better characters to discuss, I'll also mention one character who only appears in the second half - Suguha. She is Kirito's sister and of course, she has a major crush on Kirito. Another contributing factor to my hatred of SAO is how they used Kirito's own sister (close enough) to make him look better. Some plot devices are better left unused.
Enjoyment - 3/10
I had to force myself to keep watching after the initial 6-7 episodes. By the last few episodes, I was only watching it to finish it off, so that I could remove it from my list.
Overall - 3.4/10 ~ 3/10
Not many anime out there that I hated as much as SAO. I guess only Guilty Crown comes anywhere close. I'd say stay the hell away from this one if you value your sanity.
TL;DR? Here's a quick summary:
Pros:
-Good art
-Lots of fast paced action sequences
Cons:
-Just about everything else sucks
-Terrible characters
-Predictable story
-Probably the worst lead character you'll see in a while",3
"
                Ah, Sword Art Online. One of the most anticipated animes of 2012, it has many people claiming that SAO is ""The best anime of 2012"" and is it? No. Let's explore the many reasons as to why SAO failed so badly.
Story - In the year 2022, a new type of technology called the Nerve Gear is released and allows fans of VRMMORPGS to enter the game like never before. Enter our main protagonist Kazuto Kirigaya a.k.a. Kirito. 
That is just the basic plot, but from here on out the antagonist of this world Kayaba Akihiko entraps the players of SAO until they can clear all
                  100 floors.
After SAO is over Kirito has to enter another VRMMORPG to save his girlfriend Asuna who has been trapped.
Characters - Let's start with Kirito, he has no depth to him, he is a plain character who makes these promises to save everyone and yet he can't keep them. 
Asuna is the other protagonist in SAO and after an episode or so, herself and Kirito fall in love and eventually get married. In saying that she has no back story to her, it was not mentioned why she entered SAO in the first place. Aren't back stories important in animes so that we can relate or feel more for the characters?
Sugu/Leafa..My main complaint with the series. She enters when Kirito enters the world of ALO (ALFheim Online) and she has got to be the worst character of this year or worse. First off in the real world Sugu and Kirito are cousins, in the virtual world they aren't aware or she isn't aware that Kirito is her cousin so she starts to develop feelings for him. For the first couple of episodes in ALO, it mainly focuses on her and her bitching and whining that she loves someone that she can't get. Anyway, the whole Sugu loving Kirito thing and when she said ""Do you only have love for her""? That was just a huge facepalm moment and when she finally does put together the pieces (cos she was too dumb to figure it out earlier on) she blames him, then has another bitch and cry.
There are other characters (side and major) and I didn't really touch on the other criteria, but seriously this anime gets way to much praise and I just wanted to rant on my hate for Sugu.
Enjoyment - I was hyped for this anime before it's release and was extremely disappointment. The music is probably it's only saving grace so to speak. The ending was also crap.",6
"
                Sword Art Online is a overall pretty good anime. Personally I liked it a lot for it's characters and story. The first arc of the story was simply amazing with it's action, story line and characters. It started to slip away a little for me in the second arc. If you are the kinda of person who likes to play video games specifically RPGs then this is the show for you. It's about a young boy who gets trapped into a VRMMORPG game called ""Sword Art Online"". I know we all had that dream when we were young that a video game or show that
                  we wish could be in real life. This boy is living it. This was my favourite anime of 2012 and I could say that it may be in my top 10. Overall I give this a 8 because the second arc was not very interesting and turned one of the main characters into what they shouldn't be and what they are not. This anime I would recommend you watch if you have time.",8
"
                When I first watched SAO I was hooked. The premise had been done before but that didn't stop me getting in the show. I figured Kirito could grow to be an interesting considering his position in the world. But the show never gave him any true obstacles to overcome. He was literally perfect or things just worked his way. I mean him trying to be a loner so he wouldn't have to see others was ok. But after a few episodes he was so overpowered he never had to worry. He was paper thin as a character. 
Even worse than that the show moved at
                  such a break neck pace I'm surprised I didn't catch whiplash from it. The pacing was brutal and character development suffered because of it. The show introduced so many characters and we would only see then occasionally. Most of them seemed great but outside of a few brief appearances we never learn more about them. This made believing in Kirito and Asuna romance difficult. It just happened so fast and the show expected us to just accepted a character we hardly know is his soul mate. 
That is rings me to the second half. It was entirely pointless and creepy! The return to the real world, his sister/cousin crush, and the vaudeville villain ruined the show. First off they skip over the real world ramifications of the game. We hardly even hear anyone talk about what happened. I mean 10,000 people were trapped for two years and it's basically swept under the rug. We never really see any characters recover from the order at. When I first watched SAO I was hooked. The premise had been done before but that didn't stop me getting in the show. I figured Kirito could grow to be an interesting considering his position in the world. But the show never gave him any true obstacles to overcome. He was literally perfect or things just worked his way. I mean him trying to be a loner so he wouldn't have to see others was ok. But after a few episodes he was so overpowered he never had to worry. He was paper thin as a character. Even worse than that the show moved at such a break neck pace I'm surprised I didn't catch whiplash from it. The pacing was brutal and character development suffered because of it. The show introduced so many characters and we would only see then occasionally. Most of them seemed great but outside of a few brief appearances we never learn more about them. show just skips ahead two months. The second half could have death with them recovering and making their love work in a world that they don't know anymore. That would have been amazing. But I digress. 
Then the whole sister/cousin plot line was beyond uncomfortable. It just comes out of no where and makes no sense. We barely know Sugu and she's just trusted into the forefront. Every time she was on screen with Kirito I cringed. They could have taken her character is a completely different direction. Maybe making her a little sister desperate to make a bond with the brother she has become distant with. That would have made her presence make more sense and 1000 times less creepy. 
But by far my biggest issue with the show is Sugo! He's horrible as a villain and character. Firstly how did he make a game that uses a newer nerve gear and get people to play it? No one in their right mind would use anything like that after the SAO incident. Secondly why would he announce his evil plans to Kirito? Why not just marry her and continue your plans in secret. For a genius he seems extremely stupid. And I don't even want to get started on the final show down. I was angry but couldn't stop laughing it was laughably bad! They should have just had he get run off and kept that outrageous melodrama for something else. 
I'm not trying to be overly critical of the show. In all honesty I wanted this show to be great they just wasted the chance. I would have loved for them to just slow the pace and let all the characters grow and maybe did a new arc in a second season. At least they'd have a roster of characters we know and care about to keep us hooked.",5

                Sword Art Online is an adaption of the light novel series of the same name written by Reki Kawahara and follows the events that occur within the first four novels. Sword Art Online revolves around the male protagonist named Kazuto ""Kirito"" Kirigaya who enters a Virtual Massive Multiplayer Online RPG (VRMMO) called 'Sword Art Online'. Players of Sword Art Online are thrust into Aincrad, a virtual fantasy world that consists of monsters and dungeons. Sword Art Online and the world of Aincrad takes influence from many real life MMORPGs and those who play these games will be quite familiar with the references and game mechanics
                  that occur within Sword Art Online.
The anime takes off to a good start and leaves an extremely strong first impression as it showcases beautiful visuals and very crisp animation. The world of Aincrad gives off a pensive atmosphere that helps viewers feel immersed towards the events that occur within. From the very first episode, we're immediately told that Sword Art Online isn't just any ordinary MMO, but a game of survival where in-game deaths will lead to death on the real world as well. The severe penalties of this game creates a sense of danger for Kirito and his allies as this helps create a really enjoyable start to the anime. 
However, the enjoyment of Sword Art Online takes a decline as the story becomes an inconsistent mess. Major Plot holes develop and the story tends to take major time skips, yet we're still subject to viewing insignificant episodes where no story progression occurs. With a story that stretches over a two year period, one would expect there would be plenty of significant events that occur yet they were minor or non-existant. The largest flaw of Sword Art Online would be the weak characters. Characters that played a key part in the story become quickly forgotten and the unimaginative nature of Kirito and his love interest would turn out to be incredibly cheesy and painful to watch. Yes, Sword Art Online attempts to implement romance, but the lack of development and build up towards this romance leaves viewers in an awkward position as the story eventually revolves around this romantic relationship during the second arc. 
Although Sword Art Online contains a poorly developed story and weak characters, it exceeds in its intended purpose: action. The fight scenes of Sword Art Online would serve to be the ultimate reason to continue watching the series as they are well animated, and backed with an epic soundtrack to reinforce the feeling of determination emanating from the fights. Sword Art Online is nowhere near a bad anime, the flaws and inconsistencies are easy to ignore and one can find great enjoyment from this series. However, Sword Art Online brings great disappointment as it had great potential and could have been something amazing. This anime is a fun, but bumpy ride, yet quite forgettable. If you're intrigued by MMORPGs and you're looking for an enjoyable twenty-five episodes, this is the anime for you. If you're looking for something memorable and worthy of re-playability, I advise you stay away from this series.",6

                ****SPOILER ALERT IN THE RANTING SECTION*******
I haven't ever seen any other RPG-based anime before, so I didn't have anything to compare SAO to. When it started out, I really liked it. The characters were well-drawn, they had interesting enough personalities not to make me drop the show, and the story was progressing well. However, that all changed when the second season started. (That was the second season, right?)
WARNING: RANT AHEAD (************FULL OF SPOILERS************)

The story got side-tracked on this random incestful story line (they grew up together as siblings, I don't care if they're cousins, I think it still counts) and the show started to go downhill. This ""plot twist"" was really random and only detracted from the show. Instead of exploring the cool capabilities of magic in the new game world or other interesting possibilities, the writers got bogged downs with random crap. ""OMG, it will be SUCH a plot twist when she finds out Kirito's her brother and she confesses her love!"" ""Let's have Asuna almost get raped. Now THAT is exciting."" ""How about we virtually leave out all of the characters from the previous season until their obligatory appearance in the last episode, even though them interacting in the new world would be fascinating and they were really important!"" There is honestly so much they could have done with the plot, and I'm frankly disappointed. If I wanted to watch ecchi, that's what I would watch. So stop distracting from the good points of this anime! Gah!!

Rant over. *********END OF SPOILERS*************
This show started out promising, and although the concept isn't super unique, it was well-executed and I enjoyed it for the first season. I would recommend not watching the second season; you don't really have to to feel like the show is resolved.",7
"
                I don't know why, but I started losing interest in the show ever since episode 7. Then that's when I gave up watching the anime at episode 9. I don't know why, but it just got boring in my opinion. I guess it got repetitive with all of the same procedures they do in every episode. To me, it's like all they do in every episode is have one or two battles, then talk throughout the rest. You can go ahead and watch it if you like, but just don't expect much.

                (no spoilers in the first part, spoilers in the second) (sorry for bad english)
Sword Art Online ...
Let's start by saying that before seeing it I was told that it was the worst thing ever invented after the nuclear bomb, and this intrigued me.
So I started watching the series.
I saw the first episode and ... jesus, but it's crazy!
I immediately fell in love with the series which, despite a small rush in the initial episodes, caught me in a way that no other series had ever done. I fell in love with the two protagonists and immediately started cheering for them.
Once the series was over I
                  started thinking about what the problems were in this series and why it was so hated.
After a careful analysis and after seeing all the seasons that follow (Sao II, Ordinal Scale, Alicization and Wou) I can say that the problems are ALL IN THE FIRST PART OF THE FIRST SEASON AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE MOST PART OF THE PUBLIC ABANDONES THE SERIES TOO SOON AND DO NOT APPRECIATE THE CONTENT.
(I will say what these problems are at the bottom of the review, in the spoiler part)
Ratings:
Animations: 9.5 / 10
Simply fantastic and spectacular. If you want advice, go ahead with the series, they improve even more.
Music: 10/10
Breathtaking music and always on the piece. It always adapts to the situation and is always rewarding. (soundtrack second only to AoT)
Characters: 6.5 / 10
Unfortunately only the two protagonists and Sugu are deepened. The rest of them will have their time to shine in the following seasons.
Plot: 9/10
How it is told: 6/10
Enjoiment: 10/10
Unfortunately, however, I must say that the animated version has some problems that can annoy someone (like myself)
(I hate who wrote this series because it could have done much better)
Here are the problems I mentioned earlier.

SPOILER ATTENTION SPOILER ATTENTION SPOILER ATTENTION
The problems I'm talking about are the following 4 and they are all in the first part of the first season:
- Too many time skips too early in the series (negligible?)
- They didn't explain that Klein uses the resurrection item before 10 seconds on Kirito. (viewer thinks Kirito is resurrected thanks to his willpower)
- It is not explained why Asuna does not die and why she manages to stop the paralyzation imposed on her by Kayaba.
(they don't explain that Asuna's account was protected and controlled by Sugo, computer genius and rival of Kayaba, creator of AmuSphere and head of the organization that was in charge of keeping an eye on the players during the dive in Sao. In these years of checks on the survivors of Sao, he managed to enter the system and, without telling anyone and only for personal purposes, he isolated Asuna's account so that once the game was finished she was transferred in Alfheim Online, his game. (together with 200 other players about not to arouse suspicion)
And it is precisely for this reason that Asuna has lost her ""paralyzed"" state: Sugo was monitoring her and, to make sure that she reached the end of the game, he freed her.
- It is not well explained that Kirito is a computer genius who studied and understood SaO, which is why he easily manages to hack and understand the game code.",9
"
                What a glorious mess. Average should mean unremarkable. Average things can sometimes be worse than bad things, because they can’t make you react. At least something that’s offensively bad makes you angry. Sword Art Online is average because there’s a crappy, overly serious hero’s journey here mixed with a subversive, psychological sci-fi story.
Villains often want to make a change to the world, and that takes the form of destruction. Saving the world means not letting the villain destroy it, whether it’s a senseless bad guy or a specific idea. We rarely meet villains who are creators. We sometimes get the ‘death game’ creators (Saw, Death
                  Race), but all they do is make other people destroy stuff.
Here, we get an actual creator. Our main villain is in a position of God. He created the world, he controls it and he doesn’t let people just easily exit. On paper, this sounds like an exciting adventure which will explore interesting themes like suicide and optimism. Harlan Ellison tackled the God-like character in his brilliant story about mouths and screaming.
Sword Art Online isn’t a death game like the aforementioned films. It’s a real world with slightly different rules. You can die in it just like you can in the real world, but unlike Death Race you’re allowed to do more things than fighting or dying. That’s why it makes sense when some people decide to stop trying to get out of SAO.
Instead of trying to Win at Life, they’d rather slow down and find a few things they like. For some of them, the world of SAO is far more exciting and beautiful. Then again, isn’t that why some people play video games and watch anime? They’re trying to escape from one world to another. Yet when they get trapped in that world, they want to escape back to the real world.
All of this sounds really clever, only there’s no character psychology to give substance to these themes. Akihiko’s motives for creating this world are, what? Just to observe people in action?
When Harlan Ellison created AM, who has the power of God, he tries to think what kind of power can do to someone. In his eyes, it would drive a person insane and made torture people because he got nothing better to do. I kept waiting for something like this in Akihiko, some motive that will make his actions make sense or how creating SAO affects him.
How does all this power affect him? What did he learn from his observations? Maybe he’s like Attack on Titan’s Hanji, a person who’s too caught up in his research to notice people? He delivers some speeches in the end of the arcs, but he might as well walked with a sign that says ‘a winner is you’. That would be funny and more clever.
It gets worse, though. Akihiko is an interesting character whose psychology was left on the floor of the board meeting. Sugou is just a cartoon. He’s evil for the sake of it. There’s no difference between him and your average Digimon Adventure bad guy, only he doesn’t look as cool. The package comes complete with grand speeches about evil ambitions, mind control research and slug-like creatues who want to molest poor Asuna. Just in case you didn’t get it, the bad guys are ugly slugs.
It was going so well until then. Some complained about the time skips, but I just see focusing on what’s important. The format of ‘This happened, and then this happened’ is boring. Storytelling is choosing what to include and exclude. In those Slice-of-Life-esque episodes, the creators chose stories that will illustrate how the world works and how people behave in it. This is how worldbuilding should be done.
Even the romance section wasn’t terrible. It was actually one of the highlights. A romantic story doesn’t end when the two get together. There’s a story to be told of how their relationships work. These romantic scenes make us care about their relationship because we see it in action. We see them laugh, think about the future and enjoying each other’s company. Put them next to the stories when they deal with death and it’s even more effective. Sachi’s episode remains hard-hitting, and the first episode hints at something unsettling like Digimon Tamers. We even get color schemes that echo the D-Reaper, and you can’t go wrong with that.
Then it degenerates into Rescuing the Princess. Kirito’s a Gary Stu, but it doesn’t become as annoying until that happens. SAO swings from a fun adventure to serious Sci-Fi without notice, which makes it just an admirable failure. When Sugou does his sexual molester stuff, the series just gives up.
I could tolerate Kirito in a more light-hearted context. He and Asuna are both pretty perfect, but there’s charm to his humble, yet powerful persona. He’s stuck in a show that keeps pointing to depth. Since we never get enough meaningful moments, the Gary Stu problem just makes it obvious how shallow it is.
I found myself more interested in Sugou than Kirito. We never get to see Kirito’s hard work. He’s doing nice things because it’s nice to do them. He never strives for something, but why should he? He’s an alpha male who get a beautiful girl and got some others going after him. He has all he needs in the world. Even the hard re-adjustment to the real world isn’t addressed. He just goes off to rescue the princess.
That’s a static character whose role is to mow down mooks, not to make things happen. Sugou is interesting. He doesn’t just react but acts, creates conflicts and his wants, needs and flaws.
Yet, even when this series gives up on itself you get a moment that reminds you of what it could have been. There’s a harem thing going on, but it’s much less prominent than people say. It also lets us see the rejected character deal with heartbreak and trying to get over it. The incest thing may have been out-of-place, but at least it’s handled well. Suguha isn’t cast aside, but reacts to the heartbreak.
Those moments were enough to make me curious to check the light novels, but the anime is just a collection of good ideas brought down by cliches. It’s Date A Live all over again, only less brave. It’s weird. Date A Live was more obvious in its harem, but it never settled on clear heroes and villains. Sword Art Online is a cool series that gives up on itself, tells the hero to go rescue the princess just because they’re sick of the whole thing. Someday, someone will remake this and fix these flaws. Until then, I’ll sit back and watch people get really angry over this on message boards.
By the way, the wine bottles from Skyrim make a cameo appearance

                I give this anime an 10 because it was amazing
****Sort of spoilers but not really, but if you don't want to know ANYTHING than you shouldn't read this. The spoilers aren't really spoilers though****
First of all, the art is so beautiful and the way the worlds, the swords and everything looked. But when they were fighting it was the most amazing thing. So real. Also parts in Alfenheim where they were flying looked amazing.
The characters all had their own style, the way they walk, fight and fly. Their expressions. At the end of episode 14. I cried because something happend to one of the characters.
                  I felt so bad, she shouldn't die. ( can't tell everything because it will spoil it) but this is the second anime in 4 years to make me cry. When I fell Asleep that night the only thing i could think about was how he was going to save here. And, just by the way, Yui-chan is sooo cute! especially as pixie
The whole story was interesting. A good combination of action, friendship, adventure and love. It kept me entertained and i wanted to know what would happen in the next episode so bad even though every episode has an closed end (the adventure of that episode was finished but the overall story kept going on) 
Overall: I think this anime is amazing. It made me laugh and as you can read above: It also made me cry. I was amazed by the story and I wanted kirito-kun to safe Asuna so bad I was literately shouting at my laptop. If you want an adventures story with a good dose of love, friendship and fights in it, than I think you will really like this anime",10

                Sword Art Online is one of the most recent hits to hit the anime world. It focuses on the story of a boy who is referred to in the online world as Kirito. The premise of the story is that 10,000 people who log on to a virtual reality massive multiplayer online role playing game (VRMMO) are now trapped inside by its creator. In order to escape, they have to complete the game by clearing all 100 floors of the game.
The premise of the story is great, but what ultimately hurts the series is the fact that it is incomplete. The journey of Kirito is
                  one that is full of hardships and difficulties, but we only see highlights of it. It starts from the first floor, then it jumps to around the 50th, then to the 74th, and then at the end. They talk about other events that occur, but they are never shown on screen. Some of these are important events that seemed to have affected the entire community that is trapped in the VRMMO, but they become ""noodle incidents"" that are only referred to in name. As a result, it feels like a lot of it is missed out.
For some reason, I really like the art of the series. To me, it seems simple, yet is highly effective in communicating that the world is in fact a virtual world. Each of the characters are introduced in the first episode (some are shown for a split second in the crowd), but we also get to see them change as they progress through SAO. It is nice to see that characters change their appearance as time passes for them.
Both of the opening themes and the main theme that plays whenever Kirito does something amazing are all songs that stick out to me. In the past, I have rarely taken a liking to the theme songs of anime, but SAO is one of the ones that I like and those songs stood out to me. The songs help contribute to the atmosphere, but they are mostly done for action phases. However, in the later episodes, the music also begins to help communicate emotion.
Character development is something that I am mixed about in this series. The main reason for this is that it feels like a HUGE chunk of the story is missing. Kirito begins his journey on the first floor, but we only see his first day and his last two or so days on the floor. We do not see key events in the story that contribute to their growth. Some of them are mentioned and a few are hinted at, but it feels like they are glossed over. For example, Kirito and Asuna have a disagreement about how to deal with a monster and whether or not they should lure the monster to the town so that they can kill it while the monster is busy killing NPCs. However, we do not see the events leading up to it, or what happens after. Leaving out these events hurts character development greatly. The second half of the story also depowers Asuna and forces her to become a hostage that Kirito has to rescue. She does have a moment in which she does try to free herself and nearly succeeds, but it is ultimately up to Kirito.
While the story, art, and music is good. The story still feels incomplete. There seems to be a lot missing and the two year period that Kirito is trapped in SAO is condensed into a dozen episodes.",8

                STORY
The story for Sword Art Online is probally the hardest part to review because you dont want to overpraise the show but at the same time you dont want to not do the novels justice so im going to be talking about strictly the anime adaptions story.
Its Shit, thats the best way to place it however its not the shows fault.
If it had more episodes to work with it would have been much better but because each arc got roughly 12 episodes to work with many crucial points of the story were removed making it feel choppy, rushed and like the writers didnt even try.
Take
                  the Aincrad arc for example.
The first half was used to establish key characters but it was forced to be done so fast that it just comes off as a ""girl of the week"" style common in many generic harem anime.
Also make no mistake SAO is very much a harem anime its just done alot smarter than most.
But back on topic when you get to the second half of the aincrad arc you get the main focus returned on Asuna as the lead heroine however because key elements are missing from the story her shift in personality seems so sudden and out of nowhere.
But i guess thats what happens when you have to cover 3 years of a story in only 12 episodes.
Next you get to Alfeim Online which is universally hated by both fans of the anime and the novels.
Its just poor writing in general and fills like filler until the final 3 episodes of the first season.
If the show had more episodes or more were used to cover Aincrad then i really thing this show would have a much better story.
ART
The artstyle for this series is one of the few things that truly stand out about this show.
True, the designs are nothing we havent seen before but they do fit the series well enough to make it believable that these apearances were made by the creators of a MMO.
But what really stands out is the animation.
True its not Unlimited Budget Works tier animation but its done well enough to catch your eye and make you truly appreciate the beauty of their attacks.
SOUND
remember how i said that the art was one of the few things that stood out?
well the sound is the other thing, everything relating to sound in this series is absolutely perfect (aside from the english dub)
everthing from the openings, to the BGM and even the sound FX are recorded and mixed perfectly.
The japanese dub sounds amazing and even though its not the best the english dub is pretty good too, it just takes getting used to after watching the japanese dub.
CHARACTER
the characters for this series are done pretty well despite a few complaints such as them having little to no personality and relying heavily on anime archetypes as their personality and the fact that every woman within 3 miles of Kirito flocks to him like cats do with catnip.
But what i do like about these characters is that despite all that they are realistic because they have to come to terms that until the game is over they will never see their friends and families again and thats assuming that they even survive long enough in the game or if something happens to their body in the real world.
This forces them to come to terms with their own mortality each and everyday and live like they wont see tommorow.
ENJOYMENT
despite all this shows faults and shortcomings it is still a enjoyable show even if it does feel forced because it feels more like a character study or a social experiment than it does a harem series or even a shounen series.
It is a show that i do recommend however i recommend it with a open mind because it does have many faults but its still a decent show to watch if you dont take it too seriously.",7
"
                First time review but i just want to start off by saying that i thought they should of ended it earlier. 
Story: the plot was great at first, but like any gamer who plays days on end in a MMO. I think you should focus on the gaming aspect. 
Art: I'm no artist but the artwork was fair. like any anime characters drawings were decent, but the fighting scenes were Nice, that is why i gave it a 7.
Sound: As for within the anime the music was nice. and voices of the characters were good. but what earned its 7 was due to the opening
                  song, loved the song.
Character: the main hero Kirito and Asuna well played out. if your a Romance type you'll love them. as for the rest of the characters they played a nice role, it did have a good feeling as if you were playing an MMO.
Enjoyment: I personally thought it ended it episode 14 In my mind it should stay there. but to have a good review i must watch the rest, its quite funny still and makes my heart move still with the Romance. 
Overall: like i said it should of  ended earlier but its still something I'll still watch.
Thank you for taking the time to read my review",6

                Sword Art Online is an anime which has truly caused some controversy. As most other popular anime, there is a desperate war being fought between the ongoing praises of its huge fanbase and the never-ending provoking of its haters. Belonging to the former group of people, in the following review, I will tell you why Sword Art Online is a good anime, receiving way too much hatred for all the wrong reasons.
First of all, let it be said that Sword Art Online is a deep, psychological survival horror death game anime, tackling many interesting, thought-provoking questions about the future risks of (online) gaming and how
                  people act quite differently in contrast to the norm when their life is at risk. And while it is overall a very enjoyable ride, it also touches upon a broad variety of darker themes, like suicide, desperation, regret, showing weakness, the urge for revenge and many, many more inner conflicts, proving that entertainment media can actually convey inspirational messages and go beyond the limits of just simply wanting to amuse its audience.
Furthermore, let me state that the concept of being trapped in an online game is very innovative, ingenious and truly intrigued me (and a lot of other fans as well). By now, several shows such as .//hack, Hunter x Hunter's Greed Island arc and (to a certain degree at the very least) Serial Experiments Lain have ripped it off and tried to capture its complexity, more often failing at such a difficult task than not.
What sets Sword Art Online worlds apart from its numerous (in)famous clones, however, is the quality of writing. The pacing is really superb and makes it apparent that this is a show where a good story was a set priority unlike with other shows like, say, Naruto. Sword Art Online always makes progress and never feels like it's stretched out for the sake of bringing in more money (hey there, DBZ, One Piece and the shounen genre in general). Time skips ensure that you're not getting tired of exhausting grinding but provide variety. In one episode, Kirito has to fight a dragon to gain material for a stronger sword. In another one, a brilliantly constructed murder case occurs and Kirito has to solve the mystery. Then there's an episode about player killing, another one about AIs (= an artificial intelligence), there's even one on fishing. Within a few episodes, Sword Art Online manages to accomplish so much more than most other anime out there and most of the twists it had up its sleeve were real shockers, proving that SAO really got a killer plot to boast with. The games are also just like real MMORPGs and you absolutely want to play them (even though the discern for the elves is somewhat warranted). That's obviously a good thing as it is sound proof that the careful, well-crafted world building absolutely worked out.
One of the show's strengths are the characters. Kirito is totally badass and I'd love to have some adventures with him in Aincrad. He's totally different from all those wimpy male protagonists from other shows. Asuna, too, is a good fit for a heroine. Not even once does she prove to be useless as it's sometimes the case with female characters in anime and more than once, she manages to save Kirito's life. She is one of the strongest players which is a rather welcome change to anime's usual portrayal of weak female characters. Competent characters like those two are omnipresent in Sword Art Online and successfully carry the show. The entire drama revolving around Suguha - with no doubt one of the most outstanding characters in the history of modern anime - was probably one of the most soul-crushing things known to anime fans and once more demonstrates that in Sword Art Online, active characters drive the plot forward rather than just being a part of it while it happens around them. The show also has great villains. Both Kayaba, who is very deep character and Sugou, who you can easily hate to no ends, have very well-written personalities and manage to fulfill their roles. Those are not your run-of-the-mill antagonists, that's for sure.
The romance was handled really well. The character interactions between Asuna and Kirito were extremely pleasing to watch and far from the generic standard romance you would expect from most anime. There's actual progress rather than an endless amount of resetting the developments of their relationship and returning to status quo. The author also manages to embed some family values in the story which is a rare but nonetheless appreciated element.
The presentational side of things is almost without any flaws: The animation is brilliant as anyone who has taken a look at the stunning background art can tell. The OST is very befitting of the show and does a wonderful job - not really a surprise, seeing how it was composed by none other than Yuki Kajiura (Madoka Magica, Kara no Kyoukai). The use of CG is okay because they are playing a game.
Many nitpicking haters, jealously bashing on the show because it's popular and they can't do any better, have tried to ruin the show's reputation, saying that there are many plot holes and stuff, whereas in reality, most of them have already been explained by fans or the light novel anyway. Most of the time, Sword Art Online requires you to think about what's going on but alas, that's just too much to ask for for some people. As a consequence, their lack of understanding leads to many wrong accusations, perhaps even spoiling other people's enjoyment for the show.
So, contrary to what some people claim, Sword Art Online is not a tombstone but a milestone of anime history. Long story short: Know the difference. This is, that I can guarantee, a good anime.",10
"
                After reading a few of the negative reviews here, I feel the need to set these people straight. This anime really hit home for me with the MMO theme + anime. Seeing the characters able to level up, use skills, and participate in all the other typical MMO activities has been quite fun. Yet, this is only part of the reason why SAO is so great. There is a lot of character development that makes you care about what is going on in the story, and this allows the producers to successfully tug on your heartstrings. The pacing has been great so far (I’ve seen
                  17 episodes) with a significant turning point being the thirteenth episode. Not to spoil anything, but I honestly thought SAO could’ve ended at episode 13 and thoroughly enjoyed the next few after it. 
While the art isn’t the best I’ve seen in anime, it is still quite good and there is at least one impressive scene per episode where I think how cool it would be to play in the location shown. Overall this anime has been very enjoyable to watch and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in video games and anime. You will not be disappointed!",10
"
                The story is great so far. Although following the rules of the game can be too much to contain but the characters are well constructed. It brings a point of view of what might happen to those video game lovers who wish that the games could become their reality.

                Warning: Spoilers
""Sword Art Online"" is an anime that has a plot already fantastic. The anime is perfect and adds elements that reinforce it even more, the anime itself and the plot accordingly.
Characters: Kirito, the protagonist,a boy character who is very closed and skilled as a swordsman who will be called The Black Swordsman; Asuna, co-star, is a strong character and very sure of herself who is also a good sword fighter and will be the future girlfriend of Kirito, which will form a pair that is breathtaking; Yui, a little girl who is the daughter so to speak of Kirito and Asuna (so to speak
                  because it is the product of a virtual environment and not really their daughter); Klein, a friend of Kirito, who resembles a samurai; Liz, Asuna's friend and also Kirito, forging character by character directly and strongly; Silica, domabestie girl who with her Pina, a small ""dragon"" cares about; Sugu, Kirito's cousin and co-star in the second story arc, a skilled swordsman and interesting character.
Let us now Consider some sull'anime:
The fights are all epic, the background music is beautiful and well-aimed for every situation. There are some chills from the atmosphere that create the beautiful situation and the fighting you love most!
The romance in ""Sword Art Online"" is present in the right portion, and does not fail, but rather strengthens the soul and makes it softer and more beautiful: Kirito and Asuna together complement and give the best of themselves.
In my opinion, ""Sword Art Online"" remains one of the best anime I've ever seen, although we have seen many kinds like this. This is because in addition to the drawings, which are made very well, we have a plot that leaves you speechless: the invention to create a world VRMMO where you fight for life caught me and was passionate. The relationship between the characters is very deep and there are some scenes of little comedy.
 So, finished watching the anime, I can say that this is a masterpiece and is definitely 10!",10
"
                Ok then SAO . Hmm well to start its not that bad, yet not that good either. I feel its hated on too much, and over rated at the same time. Its just ""good"".
Story: 7/10 Its good, but not completely original, i mean how many times have you seen a story about being trapped in a video game? Hell even Fairly odd parents went there when I was a kid. Yet, it does have some interesting ideas about the stress on humans in virtual reality, and i love how the world was made to look. People say this story is ""deep"" and pulls ""heartstrings"", but
                  this simply isn't the case. Please if you want heartstrings to be pulled, watch Madoka Magica or Angel Beats, heck maybe even Clannad (if that's your thing). I just feel people like it and hate it for the wrong reasons.
Art: 8/10 Pretty Beautiful world and very smooth, probably best thing next to the music.
Sound:9/10 The music was amazing, but the sound effects needed some work. Kirito sounded like he had is yells taken for Legend of Zelda, and the slashes sometimes didn't sound very satisfying.
Character: 6/10   iafter episode 3 it looks like the Characters will be interesting, but nope. The only interesting Character really was Sachi or Heathcliff (wanted to know what he was thinking, but they didn't explain his reasons very well). Yet, the rest of the cast fell short. Asuna was a common tsundere, and Kirito your average male protagonist out to protect his girl on a quest. And everyone else is just there for the ride.
Enjoyment:8/10 Its a nerdy Guilty please that I still watch every week even though its not that good. Yet I light up with nerdy pleasure over the MMO aspects of this anime (Im sorry). it has some good fights, and the world is just plain beautiful(i loved the menus BTW). These are SAO's redeeming factors (IMO). Thus all in all SAO gets a...

                 Sword Art Online, I dont think anyone would disagree that the potential of this anime was HUGE, After the release of the first two episodes, the popularity of the series skyrocketed to the point where it was on par with naruto and onepiece. However, the writers did a poor job adapting anime, leaving many cool and interesting events that occured in the light novel and did not happen in the anime. Although this is a flawed anime, the enjoyment level for me was still surprisingly high. 
The story. I dont know why many people say it's unoriginal. I think it's very original. Sword Art
                  online is about a teen who get's trapped in an MMORPG along with thousands of other players. To escape from the game, they must clear all 100 floors. I understand anime like .hack already used the plot being trapped in an MMORPG, and animes like Ixion saga and Btoom have the trapped in a game concept. However, sword art online, takes this, along with the concept of leveling up,in game stats, armors and weapons that boost those stats etc. and takes the story to the next level.  Like i mentioned earlier, this anime gained its popularity thanks to its first 2 masterpiece episodes. They were perfect. I could not have asked for more. This is where the show began its downfall. In episode 3, the show meets its first timeskip(3 months i think) In episode 7, it meets another(2 years) The number of timeskips is ridiculous and does not help improve the story in any way. Oh, but thats just the beginning of it. I cant write any spoilers, the second half of SAO is what really shoots it down. ALO,The writers completely shoots the concept of SAO out the window and introduces a new game... . Ill sum up ALO in three words. ""What the hell"" Im not saying the story arc 'is terrible or pathetic, It just does not fit in the series. Perhaps it might have be a decent anime on its own, but not fused with SAO.
The Art and Animations blew my mind. They were so...AWESOME! If i had to describe it, I would say its animations is on par with that of FATE/ZERO 2nd season.
The Sound is good. Not great but good. The 2 openings are both pretty catchy and the series does offer a dozen of epic battle music, but there are animes out there that top this one in terms of epic battle music, so it's really nothing new.
The characters in the first half are... badass. Kirito, known as the black swordsman, solo player, one of the strongest players in the game. Asuna, known as the Lightning Flash, Vice Captain of the Strongest Guild in the world. The two main characters completely OP, OP to the point where Kirito could defeat a boss all by him self( usually takes over 30 players to beat a boss) In the second half, Kirito 's still the same but THEY LOCK ASUNA IN A FREAKING CAGE. What? shes a caged bird now? Shes the FREAKING VICE CAPTAIN of the STRONGEST GUILD. She had such a powerful image and is now a like a fly stuck in a spiderweb. They messed up big in character, thats all i have to say.
 There are many people out there who believe SAO has too much romance as an action anime. Sorry, but I have to disagree. The anime does a great job with the first several episodes in character development, that led up to the romance between kirito and asuna. I understand there are other girls who fall for kirito, but i dont think its enough to make it an harem anime, I mean, they appear for literally 1-2 episodes. The romance is centered around Kirito and Asuna. One word to describe the romance is ""cute"" Yeah, thats it.
Despite all of these flaws, the enjoyment level was still high. Each episode made me want to watch the next. I finished the 25 episode series in 2 and a half days. Overall, with all the flaws here and there, i would give this anime a 7.5, rounded to an 8. The flaws are definitely present, and is easy to see them. Even so, the enjoyment level, as well as the great art and animation makes up for it.",8

                *SPOILERS*
Man oh man what can i say about SAO. Well lets just start with this, SAO is not as bad as people make it seem but then again its not as good as people set it out to be. I rather enjoyed this show but i can definitely say its not the best show i have ever seen. Every episode that i watched really kept me entertained, so it was never really boring or stagnate. If you do go on and watch this anime i can tell you right of the bat that you are gonna hate the time skips and how the characters seem
                  to be strong and complete bad asses in the beginning but then turn out to be.....well quite the opposite, im talking mostly about the female leads you'll see what i mean when you start watching. This show tries to be every genre thats out there witch was a big mistake my the producers but what done is done and there is nothing that we can do about it. By doing this characters get really poor development witch quite frankly kinda sucks. But even though im giving SAO a hard time here, i can really say that it was an alright show. This anime is really good if you are trying to get someone to like anime, its just has the certain aspects that ""beginners"" would enjoy and even though i bashed it on it before trying to be every genre or a jack of all trades type of anime has its merits because there is something for everyone. Ill end on a good note and that is the combat of SAO. The combat is done beautifully. Every time there's a fight you can't help to feel or reminisce when you were a gamer and you were fighting that really hard boss at the end of the game and when you finally beat him/her you felt this feeling of accomplishment, well thats what i felt when i say the fighting in this game.
I hope my review helped you out on determining if you're gonna watch this show.",8

                Sword Online Art is a miraculous blend of stylish combat and pointless romance to create a very cliche and refreshing overused plot. The sub-par animations is unmatched within the mainstream studios and the characters were so unoriginal and awesome, that the show felt like middle-school. After watching the first two episodes i was enthralled by the beauty that captivated my mind and then i came to the realization that alex recommended this show. He only watches mainstream stuff, and then when he’s not watching mainstream he’ll be watching a really underground romance comedy that isn’t funny. 
Lets move on to the plot. Wow, the plot
                  is very wow and so written well good- I mean the writers clearly cared about the plot, using pointless romance and fanservice along with unneeded action scenes “especially the scene were tits”- Logan Reviews. (10/0.1 review needed more swords) The action scenes played out like every other shonen manga and anime that made it so likeable because everyone who watches mainstream anime likes to watch the same thing over and over because fights and gaining new powers to overpower the bad guy right after he gets beat. 
“then lets talk about characters. all of the characters are dumb. all. of. them . but thats what makes it good i guess” - Logan Reverses 420/69
What Logan was trying to convey was that the very 3 dimensional characters were all so well written that we all felt the need to like them because of cliche stuff. and all of the animals were fake and stuff
Throughout the anime, the writers tried to insert clever comedy bits, but those bits have been done (ur mom)  like 12 other times.For example: OH HEALTH BAR AOSOA DO HEADS UP DISPLAY!!! OOOOH NOOO A BOSSS!!!!! TIME TO GET SOME LIKE POTIONS LIKE IN REAL,tyx dsgn LIFE!~~!~!~! NYAAA AIMMM A CAT~ ATTACK ON TITAN JOKES~~~~!!@#@$!%^6 
In the end of the day, SOA is just a sub-par 10/10 show that isn’t really worth watching. good luck m8s.
“i ratethe shoAROUND THE COAST, AROUND THE CLOCK:
w a 10/10 because i think it had some good penises and boobs in it i mean if that isnt thta only reason that a show is 10/10 idk waht is i just wanted a peices of kiritons ass” 
Gun OnlinE GAle review.
Wow, after the stunning unoriginality of SOA, we get a new series with a new protagonist! Things get a bit more original with a new cute female pro- wait what? Why is she talking like a guy? Wait thats the same guy from the first season? wTf? Why?",4

                i have been waiting for this anime since animenewnetwork reported that SAO light novel will be adapted to anime (almost 8 months ago) n it's totally worth waiting for it
this anime is totally EPIC and WORTH TO BE WATCHED as it has outstanding n unique storyline with great art...
so,if u like action n romance anime,u can count SAO in your list~

                What can I say about Sword Art Online... The artwork in the show is amazing, and the sound is moderately decent, until you see they pretty much recycle the same soundtrack throughout the entire series.
Sure enough the art style of the series is very high quality, however everything else was terrible and predictable. The story started out on an interesting note and made you think we were going to get an interesting, action-packed story. However the story really turned out to be terrible and very predictable, and mostly composed of Kirito meeting new girls who fall madly in love with him for the smallest reasons,
                  rinse and repeat roughly four or more times. The character writing in the show was also terrible. There is no growth at all with the characters; Kirito is automatically the best player in the game, just because the story says so. He's referred to as the strongest player, but they never show anyone else fighting; only Kirito who acts like it's no big deal and is a very boring character. There are many other characters like Klein and Agil, two characters he met in game, who both have a strong introduction, but then are immediately tossed aside in preference of Kirito meeting female players who immediately fall in love with him. Almost all the female characters in the series are also very poorly written; they meet Kirito, go on a one-episode adventure with him, and fall madly in love with him and are completely useless on their own.
This series is interesting though if you just want something to watch and not think about, at all.",5
"
                Sword Art Online is an anime that had everything to be one of the best but turn out to be just mediocre
Story (6)
When I started to watch the series, the story seemed awesome, but unfortunatly, it started to forget the main plot(winning the game by get to the last floor) and focused completly on the romance between the protagonists, and that's what killed the series, for me. 
In my opinion, the first arc should have been extended and the second should never had been made
Art (9)
The art is really good, the animation is fluid, the screen efects are awesome. Well, everything in this category is
                  great 
Sound (9)
- I love LiSA and Aoi Eir songs so, the opening and ending songs were awesome
- SAO is one of the best animes of all times in terms of OST. Just search on the internet and try to ear some of them
- The seiyuu did a great jog. At least I didn't found anything wrong with the voice acting
Character (5)
Kirito is really cool, Asuna was also cool in the first arc and everyone else are not important
Enjoyment (6)
Well, as I already said I really enjoy the beggining of the series, but just he beggining...
Conclusion: I really don't recommend this anime unless you really like to watch romance in a anime that should be entirely action and survival",6
"
                Sword Art Online.
Ever wanted to be part of a virtual world were you can use skills and level up? well, this is the best look into that I have seen. I loved every second of this.
Story
This story revolves around virtual reality gaming. Kirito, our MC was one of the lucky few to test the game before everyone else.
On the release, he logs in, and his world changes.
Magic, action, romance, death and growing up are all present in this anime.
Character
Kirito made my favourites list, I have been watching anime for years, and finally I found the perfect character In Kirito. Strong, emotional, smart and righteous. 
                  
Sounds like other characters you say, no, not kirito. He is awesome and acts like a normal person. Every character adds to the anime, and even though the anime goes in time skips, everything is explained and their is a lot of growth. Tons in fact. 
Enjoyment
Cried, laughed, couldnt sleep, hated parts, really this had me running through the emotions.  Everything. The evil characters were really brilliant and the villains were smart and perfect for the role.
Overall/sounds
The music was fantastic, it added so much to the anime. I dont think i questioned one song or sound choice in any of the important moments. in fact, I was delighted.
This anime is one of very few I have given a rating of ten to.
SAO/sword art online has it all. 
great characters, action, magic, romance, evil villains, moments of hope, moments void of hope and so on.",10

                Pros
+Very Promising start up 
+Strong Lead characters  
+Good concept
+Enjoyable if you don't look into it to much
+Great Art Style 
Cons 
-Poor Character development  
-Deviates from the main concept of the show -Can get boring at times 
-Slow pacing
-Few plot holes that are not explained though out 
My opinion 
First off the bat i though this anime was going to be one of the greats, i loved the idea of the virtual game world, it seemed like a great idea. I understand that there are some real differences in opinion in this anime but i have to say i did enjoy this show. I understand that some of the plot holes are annoying and they really should have taken more time to develop certain parts but you fill in the blanks for yourself and just relax and watch the show you will find you enjoy it a lot more. I think a lot of the problems begin to show there head after they 'complete' the game and the Elf arc starts. For me i think the first arc of SAO should have really had the full 24 episodes to fully develop and then a second season if they wanted to do the elf arc, even tho for me the elf arc really was the problem with the show. 
So should you watch this show? Yes don't think about it to much just watch it the experience some of the really cool fight scenes, fantastic art work, and a real badass male lead. 
Hope my review helped

                (I wrote this review around January 25, 2013, but I apparently deleted it. I was a little mad, but luckily I came prepared. Muahahaha –minor changes involved.)
My writing style will not be as formal for this show. I'm going to review this anime by giving my reaction after I finish certain amount of episodes. This way, everything will be fresh inside my mind, and I won’t forget details that are important. It’s also because this anime has received so much positive reaction from the viewers, and I wanted to put my two cents into this whole thing. At first, I intended not to watch it,
                  but the reaction of people convinced me otherwise. That being said, if you are curious about the hype- just watch it!
My reaction of the episodes will be divided into 4 sections (and subsections) so there can be little to no spoilers. Furthermore, some of the things might seem ambiguous and confusing if you have not watched it yet.
Episode 1-8
I just watched 8 episodes in one day. I have realized the plotline of this story has been done before- numerous times in fact: humans go into this virtual game world, and they have to defeat the ultimate bad guy to end all havoc. It's not original. However, the way the writers are playing with this idea feels like it is going somewhere. They may create originality out of unoriginal content. I’m looking forward to it. I guess this is what you call the hooking element, and it is possibly the reason I watched all of these episodes in one day. However, I would not consider it completely intriguing. The element of suspense is missing. I have not fallen in love with this show as of yet. It is tolerable, and I am going to continue it, but it needs more work.
Characters:
I'm going to start with the main hero of this show, the dude. I like this character. HOWEVER, I'm going to be a little shallow. The women in the anime looked pretty beautiful, but why did the main hero look so plain? Couldn't they have made his face more.... appealing?  His attire is fantastic. Although they could have done more (it kind of reminded me of Hei from Darker than Black). Considering that this is a virtual world, it actually would make sense if they had cool attires. Again, this is me being shallow. It will not change my overall feelings about the anime.
As for the heroine, as the episodes pass by, you really get to see her real personality. It is irritating, to be honest. I don't know why people think it's alright for the women character to hit boys. It's done in many anime, but it's not funny. I don't find it funny at all. It really makes me want to go into the anime world and beat those girls up! Asides my annoyance, I'm happy that she can fight She is not that one dimensional character that is solely dependent on the hero.
So far, I feel like it is still the introduction. Let me just say one more thing. The hint of romance is bothering me. I'm not talking about the potential girlfriend at the end of the series. I'm talking about the general romance. Does every woman have to like the main hero? Also, why must the writers torment us with all these love interests when we blatantly know who he is going to end up with: STOP SCREWING WITH MY HEART! Why do you force me to gravitate into shipping couples that will never exist! I didn’t know I was watching a harem genre! Sheesh!
Episode 9-14:
The hooking element of the show is completely gone for me. I can't seem to want to continue. Furthermore, I can’t even remember what happened during the previous episodes. It's either my mind is getting old and wants to stay blank, or this show doesn't leave a strong imprint in my brain.  
I'm starting to like the main heroine girl again. Secondly, out of all the people in the game, how come only ""that"" woman can cook? This show is sexist! hahaha, I'm joking. At least, in this anime, the heroine knows how to fight properly. The interesting part of this anime is the fact that the partnerships around the main characters are based on equality. Although you do get to see the traditionalist views on certain things, the partners are not inferior to one another based on gender.
Okay, just when it finally got the hooking element, they ruin it with the lovey-doveyness. I can tolerate the romantic scenes and what not, but the maturity level has just increased in a very childish manner. For a romance genre, they are not developing it properly. However, there may be a lot of viewers that will disagree with me on that. What I perceive wrong might be justified by others. I just wasn't expecting this. I'm old but I'm still immature. I wouldn’t recommend this for the younger viewers. On the other hand, the scenes are very vague and it's up to the audience to interpret it. I know I'm being very cryptic with what I'm writing, but I really don't want to give spoilers. Let's just say, so far I'm not satisfied with this show. I enjoyed it for a while and lost interest again. However, I think this part is very opinionated. This might sway people into watching the show, or may make people drop this show. I'm at the point where I want to know how they will escape. I don’t really care about this love sap.
As I go on watching the next few episodes, there is still so much naivety in the characters, but I feel like they’re trying way too hard to show that the love is developing strongly. I find that the storyline is going so fast, that these naive characters seem to be adopting the role of middle aged adults, with the childlike minds. If the romance is what is connecting you to the show, then this anime is for you; these episodes are solely based on serving the romantic development. However, I feel like the writers bring children into this anime because they want to show how mature the main characters are becoming.  Am I really supposed to believe this to be serious? I'm tying not to put spoilers, but all I want to do is roll my eyes at these redundant storyline antics writers are putting.
After the puke of the romance, I think the storyline is starting to improve.
""A Person is very strong when he seeks to protect something."" Well, I feel like this quote sums up the meaning of this show (okay, not completely, maybe just a little?). Also, the most important question trying to be solved is if the things that happen in the virtual reality counts as actual feelings in the real world? I guess they try answering the typical question in a well thought out way. Finding a purpose for events that occur in ones life is important. 
I was not really feeling the romance in this show (possibly because of the harem element they hinted in the beginning), but I do believe those that like sappy love stories will love this! I think they could have executed it better, but it's enough to satisfy majority of the viewers. All I'm saying is, although I personally do not like the romance, I believe it is one that many will enjoy.
As I go further into this show, I just want to say: if this is the climax of the story, it absolutely sucks!!!  They didn't even allow the characters to develop properly. I couldn’t even be shocked by the twist. Actually, the twist was not even a twist. It just happened too fast. 
Also, is there a reference to castle in the sky? I wouldn't know, since I have never seen that movie. 
Okay, I didn’t like the reasoning the enemy gave for creating this virtual game. I want a better answer!!!!
Episodes 15-21
They answered many of my questions over time. But you know what I hate? It's when I'm right. I hope not, but why the hell do they have intros that gives the whole plotline. What the heck! Anyways, this is like an introduction for the new arc. 
I do not like the start of this potential romance. Just no! Why is there more love interest!? I thought we already settled with this!
We are introduced to this new character that looks like Link (Zelda)! 
The only thing I have to say is that the scenery looks beautiful, and I want to live in that universe. However, we're getting this introduction thing again. I don't know if I will get bored again, since the plot twist was not interesting.  I feel like I've seen this ""cage bird"" theme a million time. Don't people get tired of it?? Or, do creators have this subconscious fascination with servitude and control? Furthermore, I think I have diagnosed the main character with post-traumatic stress disorder.
What else? I have realized people acts different in the game world compared to the real world. I don't know if I can take this stupidity any longer.
I guess there is little mild nudity (in my opinion, it’s mild nudity), and its fan service for the men (and probably women?). Anyways, the story is not as intriguing because the hooking element of being trapped in the virtual world in gone. It's kinda boring. Actually, it’s really boring. I really thought I was going to like this arc more than the first, but I just can’t take the unoriginal concept.
As I watch more episodes, I have concluded that people in that world must be really unintelligent. Why do people go inside the virtual worldwhen dangerous things already happened before? Why are they not being cautious? Do they not learn?! I'd think people would take their time before getting into a virtual world after all that jazz happened. I guess your really can't cure stupidity.
Episode 22-25
This is where the suspense comes….and the drama! But for some reason, I don't like the characters enough to feel the empathy and the sympathy. Usually, I do feel for characters like her. Maybe I’m kinda freaked out by this certain love interest; you'll know what I mean when you watch it.
Furthermore, where the heck are the dudes parents? They showed them once, but why is the sister taking care of him? Geez? 
Oh! Did I say this show wasn't sexist? Well, I lied. It's sexist! Sexist! Sexist!  Sorry about the rage, I'll get over it in a minute. There are so many animes that does this type of storyline with women. At first, it didn't bother me, but the moment it went overboard, it became annoying. I just wonder if sick men really want to do that to women in real life.
Anyways, it's pretty anticlimactic. The show builds up to this tense mood, and they end the whole thing in an episode. I think it would take more to defeat someone that is supposed to be one of the main archenemy. Also, I was hoping the first main bad guy would give me a better excuse for his stupidity.  The second enemy is really not worth even talking about.
They rap it up pretty well, but why bring a dramatic moment now? That was ridiculous. Moreover, even when they conclude the romance part of this show, they still toy with many romantic ideas. They could have just left it as it was. 
Why you should watch it (& pros):
1) People are raving about this anime.
2) They actually have a woman (actually two women) that can fight.
3) It is not racist. I know some people get angry when they make the person of color the evil one, but this anime did not do that!
4) It has A LOT of romance.
5) It has fighting scenes.
6) The art is beautiful.
Why you should not watch it (& cons)
1) Unoriginal plot:
	a) Trapped in a virtual game
	b) Rescue the “caged bird”
2) One of the female love interest. Normally, I don’t get bothered by this type of crush, but the honorifics used grossed me out.
3) Defeating the archenemy is done so quickly. So many episodes are wasted for a short (un-suspenseful) fight. 
4) Objectifies women. I usually always tend to ignore this detail in animes, but for this one I just couldn’t. I was extremely happy when the show mentioned how someone saw his partner as a property, and not as an equal (and it was wrong, and blah, blah, blah). I was really intrigued by how this anime dealt with the female characters…. until the second arc! It disappointed immensely.
5) It has A LOT of romance.
6) Mild nudity (yes, I’m immature)
Overall, it was kind of boring. It does not have an attention grabber. I had to force myself to finish this show. I don’t think I would have even bothered writing a review for this show, if I didn’t write down my reaction for the every episode I watched.
I’m not saying this anime is horrible. After all of the ravings, I think I was just expecting way too much from it. I was disappointed because of my own anticipation. Although I thought this show was simply okay, I can understand why people are in LOVE with it.",6

                *This is only a review of the first season of Sword Art Online. This review does contain slight spoilers.
I missed the initial S.A.O. craze that happened when it was first released because I didn’t really get into anime until the summer of 2013. I actually had never even heard of it until I saw that it was airing in English on Toonami. After watching the first few episodes I was really excited about the show. It’s just too bad that the show didn’t finish as strong as it started.
Story:
The story is about a group of gamers that get trapped in a virtual MMORPG (VRMMORPG) called
                  Sword Art Online. The story revolves around Kirito, a hardcore gamer who also happened to be a S.A.O. beta tester, and Asuna, daughter of the CEO of RECTO Progress (the company that ran the S.A.O. servers). The story is the most disappointing part of this series. As I said earlier, after the first few episodes I was really excited, and couldn’t wait to see what else was going to happen in the story. I didn’t really have a big problem with anything, except for the random time skip they threw in after episode three, until the first arc ended. The biggest problem I have with Sword Art Online’s story is that half of it doesn’t even take place in Sword Art Online. Not only does this change the overall setting of the show, but it also changes the show’s entire atmosphere. In S.A.O. if they died there, they died in real life. This created a constant tension and sense of urgency. But when they switched to ALffheim Online, that urgency wasn’t there. The story tried to recreate it by adding more and more things into the plot, and it wasn’t nearly as successful this time around. The change was so drastic it felt like the show switched genres. The first arc felt like a fantasy, action, and thriller series with romance thrown in. But the second arc felt more like a fantasy, action, and romance anime. It was a typical rescue the princess story, and wasn’t anywhere near as entertaining or interesting as the first arc. All of this could’ve been avoided if they didn’t use the time skip. By using the time they just skipped over they could’ve given us a lot more character development from the main characters, as well as given more information about the supporting characters.
Animation:
The animation is some of the best I’ve seen in anime. Everything from the characters to the scenery looks beautiful. The fights scenes are also wonderfully animated. The animation is probably the best part of this entire series. The great animation combined with the sound is enough to make this anime enjoyable even with a mediocre story.",8
"
                Sword Art Online...
A story about entering a game, and must fight to log out. It sounds really corny, almost like it would turn out like hack//sign but it really is a relief that it isn't. 
The story's plot seems really bright as they have to fight to the 100th floor and beat the boss to log out. It actually makes sense why they would take the game seriously as their lives are on the line and the story seems like it would turn out nice like one piece as luffy had to get to the new world/ one piece and Kazuto needs to get to
                  the 100th floor. Also the fact that the number of episodes is questionable is really great meaning it probably won't be rushed and ruined like many other shows.
The art is very good and colorful without the black and white side characters or sloppy drawing for ridiculous moments ( so far ). 
The sound is good... at least the song and the backround sounds are not so loud you cannot hear the characters.
Character development seems nice and Kazuto doesn't seem like he'll chicken out and question his morals and Cline suprised me by leaving Kazuto ( which I have to say I am glad for because he pissed me off). 
I enjoyed the episode and if the show is adapted even half as well as accelated world i know it will be great.
Overall I would give this show a 9/10 for how well it could do... i just hope it doesn't screw up with quickness or fillers or wimps. Anyone who likes action stories about fighting like naruto, bleach etc should at least give this a try.",9
"
                alright, for anyone who wants a quick read to see whether SAO is the anime for them, here's my take:
Sword Art Online is Hunger Games: The Anime. It's about a life or death game in which people are trapped. Despite or perhaps because of this, a love blossoms between two characters. Also like the Hunger Games, it doesn't get into the more psychological or depraved possibilities of this world the way, say, Battle Royale might.

Starts with an episodic structure that zooms pretty fast through some other characters and conflicts, for the purpose of fleshing out the main characters. This is so it can get to
                  it's main point: the love story. Everything else kinda takes a back seat after that. The love story is good, starting with some minor flirting, then into some major validation of life and my strength is your strength stuff into finally some star-crossed lovers. A little predictable at times though.
7/10
ART
Clean, detailed art. Good character designs, and quite beautiful backgrounds and locations. Some of the action is relegated to stills, but when you do see a sword swing, it isn't in the same patterns over and over. Also, there's 3D stuff that is in no way intrusive and adds to the overall experience.
8/10
SOUND
Nearly perfect soundtrack. Very fitting and quite beautiful. Occasionally some odd sound effect choices.
9/10
CHARACTER
If, by looking at the cover art or by watching the opening, you've deduced that there is a lively cast of characters... you'd be wrong. There's really only two characters: the male lead and the female lead. Everybody else comes and goes for 1 or 2 episodes at a time (making them hard to relate to). Usually to never show up again, sometimes by dying. The leads are certainly passable but some may find their lack of flaws a deal breaker. They are literally perfect, hero and heroine to the max. On the plus side they are both strong and confident, on the other hand this makes them somewhat unrelatable and you're never worried they'll fail. They make for great wish fulfillments but bad audience surrogates.
(a little biased because I am not a wish fulfiller) 5/10
ENJOYMENT
This anime is definitely enjoyable to watch. It's just a matter of how enjoyable is it? I'd say it's mostly just good. Nothing is blaringly bad, but it also takes very few risks. A lot of additional enjoyment can be derived from speculation on the nature of the world. Just realize that your questions will most likely not be answered. I still find myself waiting for upcoming episodes, so i give it a nice friendly, somewhat sterile enjoyment rating of...
8/10
OVERALL
The main thing about this anime is not to go into it expecting something, since you are probably wrong. It is a love story, with occasional action and a high-concept world that isn't really looked into much beyond its establishment. I'd give it a 7.5, but with the system that's in place I'll have to err in favour of the anime because I did have a slight bias due to my preconceptions going into this series. 
8/10
Now, of course, keep in mind that this only covers the first arc (most likely first half of the story) and it could definitely change in the future. Oh, and cryptic spoiler: the arc structure comes back to the Hunger Games comparison.",8

                Sword Art Online or SAO is about many players of the tititular game finding themselves being trapped inside the virtual world. This isn't an ordinary game however for if you die in the game you die for real. The story focuses on the character Kirito who is a Beta-Tester for SAO meaning that he isn't generally liked amongst the other players. Even with all of this doom and gloom the writers still find a way to throw in a love story between 2 important characters (won't say who :D) that is suprisingly good. There are twists and turns all over the place which you may
                  or may not expect from such a (at times) light-hearted show. I'd recommend it to you if you enjoy a good romantic story/ beautiful animation/ awesome fight scenes. If you enjoy any of these aformentioned things then I think you'll enjoy this a lot.",7
"
                This is my first review so please bear with me. I also apologize in advance if I use any profanity or capitalization of words.  
Characters: 
For our main male character, we have Kirito, an ace player of the game. He is an excellent swordsman, is way too easy to beat and is for the most part unbeatable. Maybe it is a good thing for him in a life-or-death situation, but to watch as entertainment is just plain predictable. He seems to somehow overpower every single opponent he encounters, while I'm just sat in front of my laptop just thinking: ""He's gonna win this."" Maybe
                  if he came in the game not as experienced then it would be more fun watching him learn and grow as a character. But no. When it comes to romance he seems to be pretty much the same. Most female character he encounters seems to fall head over heels in love with him, even creating is own harem (which includes his own FREAKING COUSIN). Maybe apart from Asuna, this seemed to really annoy me. He also lacks personality, which just makes him really bland. Hell, even the parody YouTube videos seemed to make him  lot more interesting and fun than the one in the actual series. 
Our female lead character, Asuna, is just a generic Tsundere. In the first episode she appeared in, she had so much potential: being new to the game she is a pretty skilled player and seems pretty badass. She also seems to be a pretty good leader. But,she turns out to be another tsundere with not a lot else. Yeah, sure she's badass but that's it. THAT'S IT. Nothing else. And then her and Kirito always need to be together ALL THE FREAKING TIME. 
The side characters. Oh, the side characters. They had the potential to be good, but they just weren't when I wanted them to be. They came in at some point but were just shoved to the side to never be seen again or came on only a few times. I really wanted Kline to have a decent back story, development and screen time, but no. It never happened. 
Last but not least, the wonderful creator  of Sword Art Online himself. He was just blah. Just plain blah. No motivations were explained as to why he trapped so many people in a game. Nope. Nothing. 
Art:
The art is stunning, quite frankly. It's really nice and fluid throughout the series, along with amazing scenery even during the filler episodes. Scenery looks good, just not the fanservice. 
Sound:
Opening and ending fit the show well,  even if it's not the type of music I normally listen to. The voice acting is alright. 
Story: 
The premise sounds okay even if I've heard it before. The first episodes are somewhat decent, introducing the characters and the plot. Before we know it months have passed and thousands of players have died off screen and we're not even showed a short montage? No. The first two are only really the decent ones in the entire show so make sure you make the most of them. 
The third episode quickly tries to form emotional bonds to characters just in a few minutes which just comes off as ridiculously rushed. 
Next comes romance in the air and harem antics. The next few episodes are all about some girls falling in love with Kirito the same day they meet him. This also involves fanservice, blushing and tsundere actions. These episodes are pretty much filler. 
The biggest problem is filler. Too much filler. Somehow they manage to find time to resurrect a dragon, marry Asuna, go on a honeymoon, solve a 'murder', eat and go fishing while trying to get back into reality. Everyone loves fishing in a VIDEO GAME, right? This just follows with eye ball rolling melodrama, tears and promises of love. The surprising thing is that this happened in around fourteen episodes. Yes, there are eleven left. 
The last half is just pretty much the same as the first but without the life or death aspect. It goes downhill from there. It's just completely unnecessary. They should have just delete those eleven episodes and finish it right there. But no, it shreds up every piece of dignity it had left. 
Another problem is that the show just takes its self way too seriously. It makes it look like a super serious adventure inside a video game, but it just came off as a group of idiots messing around. I think that you should just switch off your brain when watching this.
Enjoyment:
Switch your brain off when you're watching this, unlike I did. Action and sound was great but just don't expect a lot from the characters and story. I could sit back after watching an episode and go ""Ahh. That episode was awesome."" but somewhere in my brain I'm saying ""Oh my God. Really? You've gotta be kidding, right?"" Just to reiterate, make sure you switch your brain off or don't think too much while watching this because it makes it look like a bunch of idiots messing around in a video game.  
Overall:
Average 4/10",4
"
                Sword Art Online has been a decent anime. I have not read the manga nor the novel, so my opinion is solely based on the anime and nothing else. 
Story: 
The story is alright. It's what I expected, and I liked how it took itself seriously, although, mostly. The first half, at least. 
The story takes too many twists and turns, going from really calm, to very fast paced, but doesn't make the transition very well. 
The first part of the story is them in Sword Art Online trying to survive. But then all of the sudden they get out and the anime seems to
                  be at its end in the middle of the season. I mean, it has the ending you'd expect, but happens very early on. And then they go into a new game, which is where the story kinda drops a bit. 
The first part of the story is alright, but not the best story. It's hard to go into the story too much without spoiling it. Don't go into this anime expected the best story in existence. So if you're major concern is an amazingly epic tale, you won't quite get that here. But it's still a decent story, you might want to give it a try. 
Art: 
Not much to say about the art style. I'm not a too huge fan of it, but it gets the job done. Sometimes the characters look a bit strange at angles, but usually it's fine. 
Sound: 
This was one of my favorite things about SAO. A great soundtrack. One worth putting onto my iPod. The music in the battle scenes are comparable to other epic works, like Lord of the Rings. This is definitely a soundtrack you'd enjoy, if you are a person like me who likes to listen to anime soundtracks. 
Great soundtrack. I'd describe it as very ""adventurous"" and ""epic."" With a few more soothing tracks as well. 
Character: 
The characters and character development are pretty good. But they seemed to kill off my favorite characters, so I think I may be a bit biased in this area. The lovable characters are also pretty limited. It has a small main cast, but the characters it does have are good. 
Overall Pros:
The best thing about this anime, in my opinion, is the action and music. If you're looking for any other genre, like romance or anything, the elements are in here, but are not the highlights. The soundtrack is great, and being a huge person on music, soundtrack is a big thing for me. If an anime has a bad soundtrack, I'd like it a lot less. But this one definitely has a good soundtrack. 
Major Cons: 
The only major con I could think of is there was a little bit of forced fanservicy type stuff. Basically, they decided it would be a smart idea to put sex in SAO, even though that doesn't really logically fit together. Because, if you know someone's age (and the protagonists are clearly under 18), then sex in the game would be against the law, although, they writer put it in there anyways. Basically, they added sex that doesn't logically make any sense. 
Not really that big of a deal, but for a very strict person such as myself, I thought it was worth mentioning. 
Final:
If I were to list recommendations for 2012 animes in 2013, Sword Art Online would surely be on that list, but not on the top. 
It's a good anime, but falls a bit short in story, and a tiny bit short in the characters. Everything else is rather good. 
If you're looking for new animes, you may want to look into Sword Art Online.",7
"
                I've been putting this one off for a while but I almost instantaneously came to regret this decision when I realised that roughly 3 episodes in I was already treated to subtle character development that would continue to shape the rest of the narrative.
The anime as a whole interestingly enough (and without giving away anything) is very much reminiscent of Gurren Lagann. SOA's actually scene are enjoy and progressively more grandiose, it's pace is little spastic which may annoy some but I personally enjoy spitfire plot developments interlaced by subtle world-building/character development breaks. 
Though it suffers a little from the smell of harem lingering around
                  the corner it never oversteps its boundaries and it's central romance is actually one of the more enjoyable I've seen. It also has one of the more restrained execution of tsundere, for what it's worth. SOA does unfortunately only have one joke when it comes to awkward and/or misconstrued romance and it's the same joke every other anime has ever had.
The world and the art is what really starts setting SOA apart from others. The base layer fantasy world is solid in and of itself but when layered with the MMO tropes (and occasionally humorous jabs), well placed and unapologetically dark tone, the lingering dissonance between reality for the characters and the fun exaggeration of MMO politics, SOA becomes far more compelling than the sum of its parts.
The biggest weakness in the end for SOA is probably that it plays it's strongest cards too early and ends with an unfortunately ridiculous and possible rage inducing villain (usually you'd think would be a good thing but nope).
I would recommend it but will say that you will enjoy it a lot more if your familiar with the MMO genre.",9
"
                This anime is probably the most controversial one this season. I would say that any grade between 4 and 8 is justified, because it is just so hard to give it a representative mark since this anime is extremely irregular in all points. So let's get to it!
Story (5/10):
Everyone agrees on this, the story is what kills the anime, even if the starting context might be original, which is survival in a MMORPG, it is finally a classic fantasy story centered on one character, Kirito. Even though the first episode puts the spectator in the mood, the next 5 or 6 ones just kill it.
                  Right after the first episode, some idiot in the studio just decided to put a streak of stand alone episodes that in fact are the stand alones chapters of the light novel series. They should have just made those episodes OAV if they wanted to make some more money, but no they decided to ruin the storyline... When the main arc begins it all gets better, but not for so long, but this time, it isn't the studio who is to blame, but the author of sword art online. Episode 14 should have been the end, but in order to extend the lifetime of the sword art online series, the author just made a clumpsy cliffhanger so the adventures of Kirito can go on a bit further. Is it really the anime's fault? Well don't adapt such bad novels into animes at first would be my advice...
Art (9/10):
And indeed, how shameful it is, because the art and animation of the anime are pretty good. The fights are extremly fluid, and enjoyable. All the environments are well retranscribed, the background and character design are all eye catching. The style is classic, but it works and we don't ask for more.
Sound (9/10):
Like the art, I don't have much to complain about, dubbing is correct, musics are good, sound effects are good. Nothing to complain about here.
Character (4/10):
And it goes by pair with the story, character's development is very poor. I mean inexistant. The only main character of the anime would be Kirito. The rest would just be secundary. I am dead serious, even Asuna is pretty much useless. Why? Well because the main character is just overpowered as fuck. Kirito is just so cool and strong in a inhuman way, that all the other characters look like shit. I mean he pretty much beats up everyone on his own, so why even create other characters in the first place? The author was just extremly clumsy in the scenario. I mean it could have been interesting. He is a solo player, he doesn't like to be around people at first, but since it's a MMORPG, the main character will realise that he can't do nothing on his own and will have to ally against his will with other companions in order to defeat bosses. But no, fuck that, Kirito is so awesome that he just defeat all arch ennemies in the story ALONE. That puts all of his companions in the background and of course, making us not caring about them. I am not even talking abot the cliché harem where even his sister falls in love with him, 4 is almost too good of a grade for the characters.
Overall (7/10):
Wait how can this anime be ""Good"" (7/10) with such a bad storyline? Well, the thing is that I for my part, enjoyed this anime. Even if the story really is classic, cliché, annoying and really bad. In itself, it isn't something that annoying to watch, especially the fighting scenes in this anime are to me, extremely good. It's fluid, fast, and entertaining, not too much talking during the fights making it less cheesy so I'll put my thumbs up there, i mean seriously who would have a philosophical chit chat and pull out some pseudo Hegelian sentences before a sword duel? 
So I guess that this anime would be enjoyed by those who can enjoy a Michael Bay Movie, great fighting scenes, with lights and sparkles. 
But don't watch this anime for the storyline, you will be disappointed.",7
"
                SAO is a anime that follows a boy being trapped in a game with other players, and to escape from the game he must beat the game, there he meets the several other players and together they work upon completing the game.
Generally speaking, I do not dislike this anime, but I feel that this series is being over-hyped if compared to other anime that I felt deserve more credit. The first few episode of the anime really got me intrigued to be honest, but after spending much hours into the series, you would notice that the genre is slowly changing from action to harem. I
                  mean I can understand if the director is trying to promote the MC or something, but they really make him indirectly a God, by making every female characters grovel at his feet.
But that aside, the visuals and the OST is really good I must say. The soundtrack Crossing Field is epic. Storyline is pretty decent but not legendary, a few twist and exciting parts. Fight scenes are pretty well done.
My final words are, the anime is pretty decent but not a masterpiece that everyone needs to worship. If you have the time and you are in to those RPG being almighty type of person then give this anime a shot.",5
"
                Alright, this show was getting so much hate both on the message boards and the top 2 reviews that it had on it's page that I felt someone needed to give the other side of the coin so here it goes.  FYI: I don't like reviews that give alot of information away about a show so I'm gonna TRY to be as vague as possible for specific show details.
I won't get into too much detail on the plot, its at the top of the page for you, but the condensed version is a bunch of people go into a game that they can't get
                  out of.  If they die in the game, they die for real, and the game is very, very difficult.
Story: 8
I really liked the story.  It had the familiar tastes of the .hack series with the horrible melodrama aftertaste.  Make no mistake.  It's not perfect, they're are plotholes, and they don't explain everything.  The thing about this show is it's character-focused, and on only a few specific characters at that, and anything outside of that focus doesn't really get alot of time infront of the camera.  Personally, this worked for me as I'm more a fan of watching one character do his thing (so long as I like the character) instead of a show having a bunch of characters that are all cliched stereotypes anyway.
Art: 9
Not much to say here, the animation was one of it's big selling points from the very beginning and it didn't disappoint me in the least.  Fluid, beautiful, and fun. The action really was great to watch.
Sound: 7
It's yuki kajira who is good, and I can't complain but to be honest I didn't really notice it too much.  Some of her past work has left me feeling as if her songs had ""made the moment"" and though I can't say I didn't like it, it certainly wasn't her best.  Still, it was good and didn't take anything away as far as I'm concerned.
Character: 8
I really liked the Main Character Kirito.  It's refreshing to not see some twerp ""coming into his power"" or training for 50 million episodes with each battle he barely seems to escape the same way he did last time.  He's confident, powerful, intelligent and.. well, I won't give anything else away but I'll just say I could have watched him for days and not had a moment of annoyance with him.  
The main girl Asuna was good, I really liked her too.  The dynamic she brought to the show I felt help offset kirito, two people that both act distant from people but for 2 completely different reasons.  
Enjoyment: 10
That's right, I enjoyed this show that damn much!!!  Actually.. I really enjoyed the first half at a 10.  The second half, which for whatever reason they don't call the second season, wasn't as enjoyable in my opinion and I'd probably rate it at a 7.5. We'll get to that later though.  I watched this show in it's entirety in one night and I loved it.  It had the perfect story pacing, character focus, and nice twists to keep me impatient enough to follow the previous episode with another.  It had the perfect amount of drama, action, and romance so that you never really got tired of any of the 3.  No melodrama, no 3 episode-long fight scenes, and no awkward 'looking into each others eyes then getting shy' ""oh look, a cloud, I'm gonna run away now""
Overall: 8
The show isn't perfect, it's not the best piece of fiction ever, but it does deserve some credit.  Alot of what is in the show goes against the norm, things that don't normally happen in an anime.  From the romance to the emphasis on feelings and characters and yet it doesn't drown you in the melodramatic sorrow that .hack did; this show took some risks.  Alot of people say there's little character development for the minor characters and alot of plotholes but that was a choice they made because the knew that those things weren't as important as spending time on the main characters/point of the story.  Could they have done a better job then what they did: sure.  But I still really enjoyed what they did do, and among all the ecchi, weak MC, lame wait 26 episodes in a romance anime and you MIGHT get a kiss.. it was a very nice breath of fresh air.
PS!   I said I would mention it and here it is.  My love for the show exists from episodes 1-13. The second half was only enjoyable because it tied into the 1st half and I recommend it for anyone that liked the first half but if you see the first half and didn't like it.. you don't really need to bother with the second half.",8
"
                I really don't know why the front four reviews are all 2s, 3s, and 4s. Are you implying that this show is worse than those harem shows that got 6s and 7s on the front page?
Let's leave the character and story aside, the beautiful artwork and epic/emotional soundtracks are enough to place it at least a 7. People who score it less than that are missing a crucial point.
I admit that people who write on the front page and score this anime low made some valid points and I do agree with some of their points. Contradictory, people who write that well usually are over
                  the age of the intended audience this anime is aiming at. People who hate this anime should realize that this anime is aiming at a specific audience group and it's not for everyone. They should use a different point of view when evaluating this anime.
Popular anime are popular for good reasons, because it successfully captures the interests of its intended audience!
The story and characters are not that bad as well. It's really enjoyable for me and introduce me into the world of anime. I would also say that this anime is a great starter anime.
Lastly, I want to say that this anime does a good job at capturing audience's interests and put them into the world of the SAO with its wonderful artwork and music.
This anime really shouldn't be getting 2-4s...",9
"
                I'm conflicted as I write this.  I wanted to love Sword Art Online, but..
The story starts off very strong.  Kirito, the main character, participates in a new game that utilizes a headset that allows a users 'consciousness' (for the lack of a better term) to be placed into the game's world.  Everything starts out well, but something goes wrong, etc.  The calamities taking place at first were pretty heavy, it really got a reaction out of me.  What they did for the first half was done very well, and I assumed the rest of the show would be like that.
Except
                  it wasn't.  After the first half, things happen, and the show gets really weird.  Again, no details. I can understand what the writers may have been trying to do.  You set up a great story, spin it around a little bit to create a surprising element to the show, but it spun off its axis and fell on the floor honestly.  Weird is even an understatement, some aspects just got creepy.
For all that, I was somewhat comforted by the ending.  I felt like the writers had strong momentum for the first half, forgot what they were doing for the second half, then regained some of the momentum for the last episode.  So instead of splitting my score right down the middle, I'll give them an overall fair rating for it, because I did enjoy it either way.
Being newer, the art quality was awesome.  The world they set up in SWO was incredible, the visuals were very nice.  This obviously also boosted my enjoyment of the combat scenes, everything was very fluid.  What's more, they had an excellent atmosphere set up for it.  This is probably my favorite aspect of the show alone.
The music was good, nothing was really memorable.  I can't quite remember the theme song even, but I remember it wasn't bad, so they've got that going for them I suppose.
The character, or the main protagonists, were all very enjoyable.  Again, this show has its weaknesses and strengths, but for all the weaknesses, the characters are a big redeeming factor.  They didn't quite leave a huge impression, but I really enjoyed watching them develop as the show went on, and found myself rooting for them.  This and the art style kept me coming back for more episodes.
Overall (or TL;DR), it starts off very strong, really drops in quality for the second half, and then has an ending (that I feel) really redeems it a bit.  If you decide to watch SWO, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, but it might not be what you think it is.  Usually that's a good thing, but I'm not so sure in this case.",6
"
                story- The first arch's story is pretty cool. Although it did not flow together very well. Some parts felt rushed and other parts seemed stupid altogether. The plot was good during the first arc but went to crap during the second arc. 
Art- The art seems pretty typical. Nothing bad about it but nothing to good about it. 
Sound- Nothing's bad about the sound. I thought the voice actors were great.
Character- The characters seemed good during the beginning but once the romance got introduced it went to crap. Very under developed characters and can be painful to watch.
Enjoyment- There was some cool parts that will
                  keep you entertained. The fight scenes aren't bad. The only problem is that it can be WAY to Shouneny in almost every aspect.
Overall- The first arc is worth watching. If you enjoyed it then watch the second arc but be prepared to be disappointed. It's a decent anime but nothing special.",6
"
                Oh God, this is going to take a long time to discuss.
I watched this because it was a recommendation of my best friend and it is also one of her favorite anime show.
You guys may be wondering.. why only a ""6""? 
Well, before we jump into conclusions, this review contains an opinion by me and my feelings towards this show so I can say what I think in a respectful manner as possible so please, it's not that I HATE this show... it's just I didn't find it satisfactory to my taste. 
Why is that?
Let's start randomly..
Animation (8) - Soothing and attractive. The show's style is a video game with role playing and stuff but they stick to the traditional HD animation. As expected  of Aniplex production studios, they really did a good job. I give props to the appearances of the characters as well, the sizes of their heads and body were balanced and proportional because sometimes I have an issue on those things.
Story (8) - Original, well-thought and modern. Usually, Sci-Fi anime shows prevail in the industry; such as, SnK, FMA, Steins; Gate, et al.  SAO is one of those shows that has a story based on a headgear that will make you live in your own video game story. Instantly, I loved the idea because once again, this is about survival and an escapade from a virtual world. The first episode made me hyped up about the whole series because it introduces more characters and their feelings and emotions. However, the latter part of the anime, got me confused. Yes, it is filler free and straightforward but considering how overly-fast paced this show is, I lost the connection between most of the characters and the main characters as well. Also, there was even less action in this show. Apart from that, the love story was more developed rather than the main story itself. Kirito and Asuna were not concentrating on getting out of the game; instead, they stick to kissing and making up which I didn't enjoy. They should've made this a shoujo series instead of a shounen. Lastly, I dropped this show at episode 10 because I cannot continue on watching it. It got boring and it got me departed from the story and the message it conveys. I don't know about the light novel but I just can't seem to indulge myself with this particular ""game related era"" because probably, I'm not a natural gamer. I have never been addicted to a video game for like a year so maybe that's one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy the story. All in all, the plot is 8 because basically it is original and I hope that in the light novel it would picture a better pacing than this one.
Sound (4) - I wasn't too involved with the Opening and the Ending of the show so I can't give it a 10 so instead I believe that it was a decent music. I love the background music though, it helped me gave that video game feels. Making everything so virtual and enjoying to watch. Voice actors did fairly well.
Enjoyment (3) - Just the first and second episode but the rest got my tongue stuck out and my eyes closed most of the time. I just can't get attached to it. I sometimes would rather sleep than watch it or something but still, maybe if I could rewatch it I can enjoy it somehow (when I have the time.) 
Character (4) - The downfall of this show is its characters. There isn't a single character that caught my attention. Kirito was not really special but I adore his courage and passion towards his gaming skills. Asuna is a tsundere which is already the most mainstream character in anime which sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't. Asuna is beautiful and I admire her independence but I just can't appreciate them. Sometimes I forget their names but thanks to social networking sites, they refresh my memory.
Overall (6) - This anime can be new and fresh but I was just upset about it. If only the characters would seem more influential and the pacing should be more subtle. I also wished for more action but the love story and the drama became a lot more prominent in this show. I know I have a different view on this show but if you are a gamer and loves really quick storylines maybe you can watch this. Think twice though. :D but I think you should give this a chance.",6

                OMG, I hate this show with a burning passion. If I where to just sit here and type all the things I hate about this show we'd have a thirty-fifty paged paper or a two hour long video. Truthfully I really want to give it a rating of 1 but I can't because, objectively speaking, it does have some good points and there is a method of watching it that makes it considerably less painful. 
Story: Poor design in planning and complete failure in execution. The flaws in the nerve gear and keeping everyone alive in the real world are just briefly touched on and
                  not properly explained in the anime. For the planing portion, the games the characters are trapped in are both terrible and boring. The mechanics make no sense and doesn't seem like a mmo's at all. If you had told me they got transported to another world that has a few game mechanics it would have been exactly the same. In fact, that would have actually fixed a few of my problems with this show, examples: the nerve gear, the supposed no pain, the care of their real bodies on earth, it would have all been fixed if they were just transported to another world.
The problems in execution are the pacing is horrible, and the story is riddled with plot-holes that just seem careless in nature as a lot of them had easy fixes. The ones that didn't have easy fixes were just so contrived that they shouldn't have even been in the story except for that the author wanted them in. My biggest example of this is that they say no pain is felt since it's just a game, but for EVERY hit the people look like they're in pain and their movements stiffen as if this is the case. There's absolutely no excuse for this. No explanation is given on this at all in the anime and even the explanation from the LN, which is it's reflex, is complete bs as this game goes on for years and everyone who fights in the front line should have adapted to that ages ago. The goal for the first half is completed in a half assed manner and the second half goal was completed with some bs logic involving the first villain. There's 2 reasons why this didn't get lower than a 3. First reason why this story doesn't get a 1 is that despite all the pointless detours, terrible set up and contrived points they actually finish the story and the main goal for both part 1 and part 2 of this series are met. The second reason is that this anime takes place in the future which forces me to knock down some of my problems with it's layout despite how terrible it is.
Art: Pretty good for the most part and one of the two reasons I can't objectively give this a 1. It was vibrant, colorful, well drawn and the choreography wasn't bad(not great, but wasn't bad). It does lose some points however because there are a lot of still images with just sound effects playing in the background. Pretty much ever fight scene without Kirito has this problem and takes away from the show since we don't get to see a lot of different fighting styles. Also, while the backgrounds are good they're also really repetitive and you just get bored of looking at them after a while. There were also some overly animated moments that just made it look weird.
Sound: The second reason I can't give this a 1. The soundtrack is perfect and just fits with the scenes and art-style like a jigsaw puzzle. It manages to bring out the full effect of every scene and draws you in to the moment. It's a shame that the poor story and characters hurt it so bad. My only complaint is a lack of variety, the sound get pretty repetitive later on but they're still good, and with this anime you kinda just gotta take what you can get, so I give it a pass(better than adding in some bad sounding music).
Characters: i'm just gonna list the characters and give a brief summary on their good points(if any) and bad points. This is gonna be long
Kirito: Child wish fulfillment character with multiple personality disorder and who's basically invincible for no apparent reason. I'm just gonna leave it at that because once I start on kirito i'm not gonna be able to stop for the next three pages. Just know he's my third most hated character.
Asuna: Liked here for episode 2 then hated her for the rest. Apart from episode 2 everything cool about here is just told, not shown. I'm in my third week of creative writing class and i've still already been told at least 10 times to show events in writing, not just tell about them. Because nothing substantial is ever seen about Asuna, instead of becoming a cool badass character with her own independence she pretty much just becomes Kirito's trophy wife. Seriously, asides from episode 2 and the first 6 minutes of episode 5 she pretty much just follows Kirito around, argues with him but still always goes with his opinion anyway, cooks for him, supports all his ideas, is rich, good looking, and doesn't even question his relationship with all the other girls. Not to mention in the second half of the show she becomes freaking princess peach. She's my fourth most hated character. Side note, by all logic's of the show she should be dead. While Kirito can get a pass, she should undoubtedly be dead.
Klein and Agil: Best characters in the show but given so little screen time it doesn't even matter.
Silica: Completely unnecessary. The only reason I can think of that she's here is the every badass needs a loli troupe. She takes up an entire episode and the contents of that episode were so god damn stupid and unnecessary just like she was. She's my second most hated character for a very simple reason. Her existence is not only unnecessary but it also hurts the show greatly. Asides from taking up an episode she, she's also revealed to have a pet dragon. This means that sao has a pet system and since there are no classes in sao EVERYONE can use it and yet NO ONE but Silica does. Unless everyone in this game is f'ing retarded(oh, wait a minute) then they should all have a pet. Even if the dragon is a rare pet their should still be other pets that can heal, attack or tank for you in the game, though maybe not all in one like the dragon. Silica's existence proves that there is a pet system and proves that all the players in sao are, without a shadow of a doubt, retarded. That's why she's my second most hated despite only starring for 1 episode.
Lizbeth: Didn't hate her. Her existence served a purpose, she had a followup(albeit a short one) that actually had some relevance, and she was willing to make a sacrifice for her friend. While I find her falling in love with Kirito completely unnecessary I can let it slide.
Yui: First off, so there was another loli in this? Then wtf was the point in Silica!? Now that that's out of the way, I actually liked this character. I liked her personality, I liked her backstory and I liked her design, including the pocket pixie form(I found that adorable). So it's really sad that this is my number one most hated character. Why is she my most hated character despite the fact that I like so much about here? It's the purpose that she serves. She's basically just a huge cheating plot device for the second half of the season. Her abilities are bs and way too convenient to the plot, they make no sense for her to realistically have those abilities with her backstory, and most of the time she talks is just to tell Kirito what it is he needs to do. She's the fairy from zelda with tricked out cheat codes. As someone who likes games myself, I cannot stand for her cheating god-like existence, and that's why she's my most hated character in this show
Villains: Villain one had the potential to be great but was squandered by lack of development. Villain two was just a freaking joke. This guy was creepy but held no real threat level factor. Everytime this guy showed up on screne and acted like a villain I just felt it was laughable and disgusting. 
This show is terrible and in my opinion it deserves a one, since I value story and characters more than art and music. However there's one way to watch this that hurts the brain a bit less and that is to watch it after an exam. When I watched this it was after a brutal series of exams and my brain was fried. Under such a situation where you can't think much then the music and art is more than enough to carry you through the series and is actually quite relaxing. Unfortunately sao does not focus on this and is clearly an attempt to get people interested in their crappy story and characters. It had way too much bad dialogue that pulled you out of the immersion and made ruined the immersive effect of the art and music. If it had just tried to cruise by on it's good looks and sound and focused less on their lost cause story and character interactions, this could have actually been a decent relaxation show.
Final Verdict is a 4.",4
"
                Keep in mind that I have not finished SAO at the time I wrote this review, so I will only judge what I have seen. I think Sword Art Online had an immense amount of potential to be one of the best animes around, and I even considered it to be my favorite anime at the time I watched it up until around episode 4. At this point, I thought that the show had started to lose what it could have had. I do not like what they did with Kirito, as they made him some ""Lone Wolf"" high level ""badass"" if you will. Alot
                  of the show was not an epic adventure to beat the game they were locked inside, but rather 14 episodes of Kirito messing around saving random people by standing there being OP as hell. I do not hate this show, but I do not like it very much either, I think it was misguided. One thing that I should particularly point out that kept me going for most of the show was the animation and the music. The animation was very appealing, and the action scenes were greatly enhanced by this. The music also fit very well with the anime, the opening being no exception. (The first opening, that is.) I do think that people should watch it, as I found it interesting at times, but I would not personally recommend it to a friend.",6
"
                *Disclaimer* I'm writing this review as the second time through and I'm a bit of a fan boy of the series so take my words with a grain of salt but i'll try and do my best to be fair.
*Production*  (7.5/10)- I'll start off on a good note by saying that SAO has slightly above average production values. By no means is this show the absolute highest standard of production but the artwork and animation are definitely slightly above average. SAO does a good job with creating distinctive character models (which should be expected considering its about a MMORPG) but characters are memorable due
                  to the artwork and the scenery is well done and adequately detailed. I often rate animation for these types of shows based on action/battle sequences. The important questions are can you follow the actions within the scene and did they portray the pace they intended to show. Good shows are able to portray these scenes in a way where you can follow the scene yet maintain that sense of speed. It can be really easy to mess this up but SAO does a decent job of portraying the main action scenes to meet this criteria. In this sense, SAO meets what we should expect but I rate it slightly higher probably because of deficiencies covered later.
*Music* (8.5/10) - Music can make a bad show tolerable and a good show great. The music is definitely one of the aspects of this show that elevates it above the average level. Personally, I think both OPs for the show are outstanding and the music that plays within the course of the show do a good job of portraying the overall tone of the scene. This is the one area where I feel like SAO exceeds what we should expect and was personally the most enjoyable part of the show for me.
Alright now we get into the quote unquote ""questionable/debatable portions"" of the show
*Characters* (6/10) - To be honest the show focuses so on the two main characters who are very similar in nature and the personality of the other characters either does not contribute to improve the story or do not get enough exposure to make a significant impact on the quality of the story. Asuna is a solid lead female. She is a typical attractive female that displays her strengths as a somewhat strong-willed, independent female who sometimes shows vulnerability by being an overly emotional and caring individual who needs the support in tough situations to stay strong. Plus she's a bit of a tsundere at the beginning of the show so brownie points all around. She displays the strengths and weakness expected from this type of character but it is well done so credit should be given where credit is due. The main lead Kirito, on the other hand, is far too similar in my taste to Asuna.They basically display the same characteristics in terms of how they act and personality wise. Kirito also suffers from falling into that stereotypical hero who can overcome anything type which seems to be more of a copout just to fit the story. My issue is at times he seems vulnerable and hurt which makes viewers get a sense of his mortality but everytime he seems to overcome these issues to the point where it makes him this god-like character. The side characters for the most part are somewhat forgettable except Klein really stands out to me. Klein has a likeable personality  and you can really get behind his character. Unfortunately, he is relegated to a supporting role which diminishes his role within the story. This is the one character who I wish received more time in the spotlight because I feel  like he is the one character that stands out from the series.
*Story* (5 to 4.5/10) - As much as I like this show, I can't ignore the obvious flaws within the story. Some people don't like the fact the show steered toward a love story. I don't find this a problem because it doesn't make for a bad storyline but the way the story goes about it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. The story has a great premise, the fight for your life/it's no longer a game concept was well established within the first 2 episodes. After that, the show went on these side stories that simply added girls to the harem and hurt the pacing of the story (The show kind of went through a year and half as quickly as possible only highlighting the love interests along the way). More of Kirito's character was revealed through these arcs but don't really contribute much to the story other than showing that these girls are a love interest. Yet, the Aincrad Arc develops a decent narrative between Asuna and Kirito. The ALO arc on the other hand is where things went wrong. The story was poorly done and the introduce some themes that I won't say for spoiler reasons but are questionable. The story feels like they want to have this epic/climatic ending but it falls flat due to poor writing and questionable situations. The ALO arc is where the show gets dragged down especially after some very strong episodes leading into the arc. As a final note, Kirito is OP and I don't know why but he is god I swear.
*Overall* (7/10) - I have this show rated higher on my list but to be fair it is an overall average show when considering its strengths and weakness. It has solid production values but the story falters at points especially considering the 1st episode set high expectations for the series. This is a good show for people who haven't watched much anime before hand due to its subject and appeal to general audiences. For those who have been watching anime for a while, I personally would suggest watching it for enjoyment but for the critical don't bother because the story will bother you.
Sorry for the long review but this is a show I really enjoy so I want to share my thoughts  but I also understand that it's not for everyone and if you don't like it I can see why and to each his own.
TLDR: Good intro show if you are new; otherwise it has its flaws but meets the average expectations for a shonen and is a good watch if you like the concept behind it.",7
"
                Sword Art Online an anime which has a good premise but fails in execution.
Story - The story is compose of kirito who is trapped in an online game and the only way  to get out is to clear it but there is a complication that if you die it means you're dead for good. A good premise to be exact. The anime could have explored the game and how will they clear it but instead it focuses on the romance which also failed in my opinion. Why? Because there is no development in  Kirito and Asuna's Romance. The Anime could had show us
                  how their Romance develop while trying to clear the game but instead it showed us kirito with other female characters.
Art- The Anime's art is quite decent. The character's design is okay nothing spectacular.
Sound -  The Anime Op and Ed is decent and catchy. The VA fits the characters. 
Character- The characters are flat and unmemorable especially Kirito's Harem. Kirito is OP . The Antagonist are cliche and boring especially in the second arc.
Overall, the Anime is Mediocre and could have focused in exploring the game and developed the romance properly between the main characters.",4
"
                Sword Art Online !! Undoubtedly the anime with the most number of mixed reactions from 2012. One of the most controversial series of all time. I will keep this review fairly short but a little lengthy as well.
What do I think of this? Well in my opinion it is not NEARLY as bad as haters claim it to be and not as good as fans praise it to be either. It's ... AVERAGE especially once you mix the flaws and good qualities together.
Yes everything about it I find average (well the animation is stunning but that is to be expected of an anime so new).
                  The only thing above average is the fanservice ;D. And I guess it is also very enjoyable (even if the amount of flaws are literally off-the-charts).
Now I will go into what the positive qualities of it are as well as it's flaws. Not to mention what I find about it is 'average'. If you are a hater then just read the flaws and if you are a total fanboy then just read the positive qualities :D.
But before that let me just say that I will NOT do a summary of the story because you can just find that in the main page.
Positive qualities- Sword art online is very enjoyable (barely any moments when I was actually bored) with very fine art (by art I don't necessarily mean animation but more like design and backgrounds and such). Animation is breath-taking and unique. Add those 2 (art and animation) together and you have an anime which is a pleasure to look at (for the most part lol). One other positive attribute/quality is that most of the times the amount of emotion is done just right to give you a special feeling. Plus when there's a desperate situation you can literally really see the desperation in their eyes.
Flaws- Too much fanservice is one. you could have just gave them 2 kissing scenes(one for beginning one for end). Not add the bed scenes, taking clothes off and such bull. Oh and how old are they? 16 (Kirito) and 17 (Asuna) !! And that tentacle scene was also unnecessary. (Don't worry though this anime I don't think is a hentai). And if you want Hentai then there's plenty of other stuff you can watch. Also I find it was overhyped (first episode). They made it seem like it was gonna be such a torture for everyone to be stuck in the game but really it wasn't like that. (Atleast not portrayed like that). The third flaw is the filler episodes. That episode where he got the sword was unnecessary (this isn't too big of a deal and plus I liked it). The final flaw is definitely the premise for the second half. Like the anime is called 'SWORD ART ONLINE' for a reason -.- It ain't Alfheim. 
Now the average stuff- Characters are ALL 'meh'. Kirito is no one special (my opinion). He isn't NEARLY as good as a main character as some others (Goku, Luffy, Ed and stuff). But he has a pure/good heart so I do have respect for him. Same goes for Asuna. Music wise there are some osts which are great but really I have heard much better (One piece, Bleach, Pokemon, Fairy Tail, Naruto and stuff). Openings and Endings are fairly good.
Anyways I hope you enjoyed my review.
Finally I would recommend this anime but don't expect it to be the greatest anime ever because MAYBE you will be totally disappointed with it especially if you have your expectations for this set so high.",7
"
                Sword Art Online is not something you expect it to be. This show has one of the best protagonists I have ever seen and continued to surprise me as the story went on.
Story 9: The story in SAO (Sword Art Online) evolves pretty well. Throughout you get a pretty good sense of whats coming next. Since the the story is presented with a pretty straightforward objective their isnt really anyway to go wrong. It will definitely jerk your tears at times. Pretty good not in your face love story (FINALLY BELIEVABLE). Yet it will forsure pull you in immediately. I showed this show to 2
                  of my buddies who have been big into shows like Naruto, Samurai Shamploo and Death Note and they watched the show straight from the 1st episode through to the last in one sitting. This show will hook you.
Art 9: SAO has an AMAZING set of environments and areas that the show takes place in. The attention to detail is phenomenal. What the director has given me with the set of this show is full visual construction of a dream world with a sick twist. You may have to watch it again to appreciate the scenery.
Sound 9: General sounds for an action anime, however when it came to battle scenes there was great emphasis on the way in which weapons sound during parries and attacks. The battle sounds and music definitely create a thrilling atmosphere that keeps you tuned in. The music while out of combat suits the feeling of the scene very well. I think part of the reason the show hooks you in because it please your sense of hearing when presented with a jaw dropping scene.
Character 10: Where do I begin. Well this show has the best charecters I could ever hope for to be honest. The protagonist is very introverted but has a very kind heart. This is the character we all wish we could act like it real life. Extremely level headed while baring such a great burden for a kid. The supporting character has a fiery, sassy and strong personality that you can't help to love. Every main character in this show you get a deep feel for. This is one of the reasons you'll love it for sure. 
Enjoyment 10: This show really hit me. It December of 2013 I didn't go home for Christmas and I was going through a bit of a rough time. My grandfather was dying and my parents were with him  in Colorado all December while I was stuck alone at school. Meanwhile socially I hadn't been the way I should have been to some people in my life. So I wanted some time to reflect and change a bit. I was looking for anime one day and stumbled on SAO. This show really improved the way I felt and I could share my hard times with a character who had it way more rough. This show gets emotional and if everyone was a little bit like the main character, Kirito, then I think we could get through anything.
Overall 10: If your still reading this you aren't convinced yet. I really can't describe in words how enjoyable and deep this show can be. The characters really stand out and you're left begging for more. 2 thumbs up for SAO",10
"
                My heart belongs in the first arc of the series. I grew up playing mmorpg's and I've met amazing people who till this day I am still friends with. I can see someone not liking this anime if they can't relate to the feeling that this show gives off. I tried putting myself into my girlfriends shoes and thought how she would have seen the anime. Boring, slow, average story. These are all things I can imagine since I know she wouldn't relate as well as I did to the show. It's really a matter of being able to enjoy the emotions and content given,
                  which is a lot easier to if you can relate to it.
The story is straight forward and gives a clear goal which isn't such a bad thing. A lot of shows coming out try to over-complicate the story line in order to create something ""original"". In this case, the story was simple but with many tragic twists. The anime was very successful with their simple story since it gave of such an amazing vibe compared to other simpleton story lines.  
Watching this took me back many year to a lot of great memories that I've had in game and in real life. I even teared a little during some of the romantic scenes cause they reminded me of how I was with a certain girl. Overall this anime combined two things I love and made something great to relate to, even after so many years has passed since I've had those memories. 
Overall trying to make a review for this anime is out of this question. You would simply have to watch it in order to get a clear understanding of the emotions and feelings expressed. Hate it or love it, I loved SAO and the memories it brought back to me.",9

                THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW
*Sigh* Sword Art Online. This is by and far the most overhyped anime in 2012. And one can definitely see why. It's an anime based on a MMORPG called Sword Art Online. There are 3 categories of the fanbase for this particular anime, Fanboys, Haters and the ones in the middle. This review will split the ratings into 2 parts. The first arc and second arc. Okay so let's start with the real review.
Story:- 6
In basis the story is actually very good. A large number of people stuck in a RPG when if you die, then you die in real
                  life as well. While the concept is pretty good the problem comes in it's execution. The anime doesn't focus on the actual goal of getting out of the game for the majority of time and instead fills it with and abundance of female stereotypes and instead turns the show into ""Harem"" Art Online. In addition to this the show takes itself waaaaaayyyy too seriously, and fails badly in trying to make this anything even near serious. But then comes the second arc.
In the second arc the characters are transported to a new game. This time if you die, IT DOES NOT MATTER. The entire concept of the show is thrown out the window in this arc. Any feeling of suspense or seriousness is dead in this part and that wouldn't be a problem is the show still wasn't trying desperately to be a serious survival anime. Herein lies the main problem since if there is no threat of death then there isn't any point of a ""survival"" anime. If it wasn't for this arc the story probably would've gotten a 7.5.
Art:- 9
The animation and art in this anime is by far the best part of this anime. Throughout the anime there is beautiful scenery and amazing action(although action is rare and this show). The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed and it really is one of the shining points of the anime. Even when nothing is going on in a scene they still give you something beautiful to look at, most of the time. The final episode of the first arc shows as a brilliant battle between 2 characters although the ending of the fight is arguably stupid.
The second arc doesn't really disappoint in term of animation ant art but it does seem a little toned down is some areas, like in the real world. But when the players are in the virtual world it becomes much better. So overall the series keeps a steady bar of animation and that bar is always kept high.
Sound:- 8
While some might argue, the soundtrack of this show is extremely good. Yuki Kajjura is known as a goddess of anime soundtracks and you can see this in shows like Fate/Zero, Baccano! and of course, this one. While it is true that she always composes brilliant soundtracks, this, in my opinion, is not her best work.  The first opening is brilliant and definitely worth buying. The second one is also pretty good. Both endings are good but I feel the first one is better.
In both arcs the soundtrack in itself is amazing, only when it's playing along with the anime. if the soundtrack is played without the anime playing alongside it the the music becomes not as good."" Swordland"", ""We have to defeat it"" and ""Confront Battle"" are while still brilliant even without the anime these 3 tracks in particular are reused a countless number of times throughout the anime. The do become a bit stale after a period of time. So overall, the soundtrack is epic and beautiful but without the anime it seems wrong, and some tracks are reused a bit to many times for my liking.
Character:- 3
This is by far the WORST part of SAO. Every single character aside from one has no depth to their personality whatsoever. For the sake of this review I'l keep this as short as I can.
Kirito: The main male protagonist is one of the best examples of an overpowered and underdeveloped character. He is literally invincible. Never has he failed a to overcome a challenge and kill the enemy. If you want to see a perfect example of him being practically immortal the go look at the final episode of both arcs. While him being overpowered is praised by many it's a major flaw of his. People use the term ""wish-fulfillment"" character for him and that is a perfect way to put it. People who are into MMORPGs will love this guy since he is what they want to become. Making a character who is almost ""God-like"" is always a gamble and here, they lost the bet. For a perfect example of a good overpowered character, take a look at Alucard.
The Harem: The entire female cast is consisted of a few people who get one episode with Kirito each, which is never enough for character development. The remaining 2 are Asuna and Kirito's incestuous sister(Sorry, ""cousin"") Suguha.
Asuna was a character who showed a lot of potential in the first few episodes soon is degraded into a typical tsundere and is practically forced into a relationship by the writers. The love between her and Kirito was one of the worst relationships ever. And somehow people liked this relationship because it was exactly what they want to happen to themselves, since Asuna is a perfect Waifu.
And then there's Suguha. This is an extremely underdeveloped character. She was the only main character introduced in the second arc. The only thing I got after the series ended was that she loves her ""cousin"", Kirito and has has gigantic ""melons"" in both the real world and the virtual world. Aside from that she's also forced into making a love triangle(between Asuna, Kirito and herself) by whom other than the writers?
Finally we get to the best and only ""well-developed"" character in the series. The main villain Kayaba Akihiko. Allthough I can't really talk about him without spoilers, he is a good character and the only one where you want to know more about him. 
Overall: Most of the characters get either no development or are extremely underdeveloped. Also I would've liked to see more of the character Klein who's introduced in the first episode and is rarely mentioned in the rest of the series.
Enjoyment:- 7
While I might've ragged on a lot of the series, you will enjoy this series while watching it, especially is you're a gamer who plays MMORPGs. All throughout you'll be amazed at the brilliant action, music and art as well as be amused by the stupidity the series reaches at the second arc and how serious it takes itself.
Just keep in mind that this is not the masterpiece that the fanboys praise it to be and it isn't the abomination that the haters call it.
Overall I give this anime a 6.7 out of 10",6
"
                Sword Art Online starts off with a relatively well-built and engaging story. With the launch of a new, virtual reality system, suddenly everyone is trapped inside the game with dire consequences for death. While not the most original idea, Sword Art Online manages to portray the idea in a way that becomes very appealing to the average anime fan. At the start of the story, Sword Art Online seems to be a very promising anime. With an enormous society of what would be, lets be honest, mostly nerds, Sword Art Online would have countless opportunities to examine how society evolves or devolves in such a
                  shockingly new environment... right?  
Spoiler alert: Wrong.
This is what I believe to be the ultimate downfall of this anime. All of the big questions go unanswered to satiate the ""average anime fan's"" desire for a moe protagonist that can mysteriously do any task set in front of him. It's the pure amount of wasted potential that makes me angry. On regards of story, Sword Art Online gets a 4/10.
Moving on to art and sound, I can actually say that this is one thing that this anime did right. Without going into a lot of detail, I can just say that if you have a good budget, you get good quality. Art and sound get 8/10.
Characters, oh characters. The second biggest downfall of Sword Art Online. I wish I could go into a lot more detail here, but the guidelines don't want me to give away spoilers, so I'll keep it simple.
Kirito, the protagonist: I can only assume was designed in the image of Jesus. The ultimate Gary Stu, he is literally able to do anything he wants with pretty much no consequence. 
Asuna, the leading female: I assume is a poorly designed tsundere that just ends up going really dere. I don't really know what the idea was here, but something went wrong, because no one acts like this in real life. Seriously. 
Suguha, Kirito's sister: The bipolar sister with some other problems that I can't mention because of all the spoilers. Seriously, you'll just have to watch the anime for this one. 
Of course there are a lot more characters to mention, there just isn't a lot of point to it. The fact of the matter is that every character, even the big burly guy, was made with the word ""moe"" in mind. I know that this is supposed to appeal to a lot of anime fans but... they just went so far overboard that they're on a different ship. For characters Sword Art Online gets a 5/10
Overall, I give Sword Art Online a review of 5/10. 
I would like you to keep in mind that I do have my own biased that has brought me to dislike this show. It became painfully obvious to me that the show was designed to sell rather than to entertain, and I found it infuriating. In case you're still wondering how some people come to hate such a popular show, I'll break it down a little bit further.
Sword Art Online is marketed towards the average anime fan. This creates overly moe characters and unrealistic scenarios. For some people, these situations become too obvious and ruin the show for them. 
If you don't have a tendency to be picky about what anime you watch, or you don't pick up on these little flaws, chances are you will enjoy Sword Art Online, since it is marked towards, well you. If you like battle scenes, romance, moe characters, and life-or-death situations, Sword Art Online might be worth checking out, but only if you can ignore some plot-holes.",5
"
                Well, this going to be my first review, and what better first anime to review than SAO, which most people consider to be the most controversial anime of all time.  
Intro: 
For those of you that don't know, SAO is basically about a virtual reality mass-multiplayer online role playing game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online, where players wear virtual reality helmets that take them to a large, beautiful fantasy world where they play the game.  The virtual reality helmet allows players to feel like they are actually in another world, in which they can interact with all five of their senses.  The
                  main objective game is to climb to the very top of a pyramid-like dungeon called Aincrad and defeat the final boss that resides there.  However there is a twist: players that logged in to the game for the first time are unable to log out, and once they die in the game, they also die in real life.  This creates a tense ""fight or die"" atmosphere, which is what got me to watch the anime in the first place. 
Story (6/10):
At the beginning, the anime does an excellent job of introducing the world of SAO.  Features such as monster hunting, leveling up, and item collecting are introduced through various ""characters of the day"".  As the anime went on, however, I thought the plot starting rushing itself.  There were several unnecessary timeskips that left me wondering what could have happened in those periods of time, effectively creating plot holes.  The story also had a lack of focus, and always randomly jumped from place to place.  One episode the main character is fighting a gigantic, horned beast, and the next he is relaxing in a cabin by a lake.  This inconsistency takes away much of the initial intense atmosphere that the beginning established, and also butchers the flow of the anime.  Lastly, though not a huge detriment to the plot (just something that made me mad), was that several previously established rules of the game were broken to ensure that the main character wins.  I know that the main character is supposed to always win, but I think he could've done so without causing more plot holes.  Overall, the plot is very inconsistent and has many holes, which took away much of the potential SAO had.
Art (10/10):
Personally, I think that this is the best looking anime of 2012.  The character designs, including facial features and clothing, are beautifully designed (I especially liked Kirito's black coat).  The facial expressions, especially expressions of anger or determination, are intense enough to change the mood of the anime in an instant.  The world of Aincrad, and later Alfheim, are beautifully drawn.  Natural settings, such as lakes, forests, and mountains, are rich in detail and give an atmosphere of calm and peacefulness.  The fight scenes are very well animated; the movements of the protagonists and enemies are well synchronized to keep the fights close (for the most part) and intense.  Overall, the show is beautifully drawn and animated.  
Sound (10/10):
I wasn't very taken by the first OP (Crossing Field by LiSA), but this is a matter of personal opinion.  The other OPs and EDs, however, were great enough to make me listen to them over and over again and even download them, especially the second OP (Innocence by Aoi Eir).  The OST is very well composed; each soundtrack does a great job of enhancing the mood of a particular scene.  Overall, the music of SAO is a huge plus.  
Character (6/10):
Another downside of SAO.  The characters for the most part were quite shallow, and didn't really enhance the plot.  
Kirito:
The main character.  Kirito is the typical perfect guy.  He has a calm, collected personality, possesses seemingly endless knowledge of the game, and is arguably the most skilled player of SAO.  From this, there is no surprise that he gathers a crowd of female friends.  His initial determination to beat the game is quite impressive, however any character development from him is non-existent.  The appearance of Asuna in his life gives him something to protect, and adds to his determination and character, but other than that, Kirito is a very bland and generic character that goes through no major change throughout the story.
Asuna:
One of the friends Kirito makes in SAO.  Asuna is initially introduced as an independent, strong, yet lonely player that is also determined to beat the game on the front lines.  Asuna eventually befriends Kirito and falls in love with him, which in my opinion put a damper on her character.  After she and Kirito become a couple, she basically hides behind him and lets him do the fighting, taking away her independence and any notion that she can fight as well.  In the second arc, she is literally just someone who has to be saved by Kirito, effectively becoming a damsel in distress.  She is basically like a beautiful flower that quickly withers.  
Yui:
A fairy that Kirito and Asuna find in the forest, and is treated like their daughter.  In the first arc, she is basically just someone else that Kirito has to protect.  In the second arc, she appears in Alfheim Online as a navigation pixie that guides Kirito on his journey.  Not much else to say, Yui is just someone who tells Kirito where to go.
Leafa (Suguha Kirigaya):
Kirito's younger cousin.  In ALO (second arc), she plays as a Sylph warrior (a character type in the game) named Leafa.  At the beginning of the second arc, she befriends Kirito and accompanies him on his journey to save Asuna, not knowing that he is her cousin.  As one would expect, she starts falling for him just as hard as any of the other girls Kirito meets.  After Leafa finds out Kirito is her cousin, her quickness to recover from this heartbreak and resolve to keep fighting shows her inner strength and character development, and in my opinion makes her one of the only good characters in the anime.  
Villains:
In the first arc, the main villain is Kayaba Akihiko, the creator of SAO, and the person who traps the players in the game.  In the end, after the clearing of the game, he disappears without a trace and only serves to fill the already shaky plot with more holes.  In the second arc, the main villain is Sugou Nobuyuki, who is a businessman planning to marry Asuna to take control of her parents' company.  He is a very one-dimensional character and stereotypical villain who only cares about making Kirito suffer as much as possible.  He is a character that advances the plot, but  again, he is nothing that we haven't seen before.  
Enjoyment (8/10):
Despite the plot and character flaws, I actually enjoyed the anime from start to finish.  The art and soundtrack never ceases to amaze me, and the fight scenes were very crisp and entertaining to watch.  At the end of the day, anime is meant to entertain, and no matter how many technical flaws it has, if it delivers, then its job is done.
Overall (8/10):
If you haven't already, give SAO a try!  Though you may be disappointed by the story/characters, its still worth watching to find out what all the hype/hate is about.",8

                In general
Please be lenient with me since this is my first review. I just felt that I should write something about this piece I finished today. (maybe I will write more hmm...)
Anyway let's talk about the SAO. I got recommendation from my friend to this anime and he knew that I am sometimes very critical to anime series (I always like something with deep thought inside such as NGE, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop etc.)  so he told me to watch it just to episode 14. Well good for me if the rest has no value. So I started to watch...
I used to play games
                  a lot and especially the ones with good fighting system. This anime is for me just like a miracle. World of pc games and anime (my favourite ones :D) came together. From the first episode through the whole anime you can see some common mmorpg (not only from them but generally from the gamers world) habits like lvling, pking, a bit of cheating, crafting, fighting, hp potions drinking etc. Seems really cool in anime. But what are the deep thoughts in this anime? 
Deep thoughts
Well in my opinion it is that thing many people criticise. The player's addiction to the game world. [SPOILER: They have no other choice though.] It seems like they live in real world instead of inside a game. Sometimes I got goose bumps when thinking about that. (especially when the main chars treated in-game program as their child) It is very interesting how the creators of this anime described human psyche. Like people are always looking for something they can hold. Something stable even though it is just an illusion. And they are even satisfied with that. That's one of the most important things in this anime in my opinion.  
Second one is of course the reality paradox. What is real? Is the game world real? Is it ok when you act differently in game than in the real world? (You for example do things that you would never do in real world.) What about love in the game? About that is most of the anime. Dealing with love and fighting for it. You will eventually find out that it is not important if you are in the game or not. That love just is. And not just love, all the feelings. Really important point I think. Maybe most of the gamers should think about it for a while.
Then comes the admin. (another deep thought) Really interesting thoughts about him. Don't want to spoil but I think that almost everyone sometimes thought about his own world. About the flying castle in the clouds. 
Composition
SAO is actually split to two halves (yea that's what I was talking about in the beginning). SAO and ALO. Well my expectations for the ALO? Just empty business ending for fans. Hmm I guess I was a bit mistaken. It is true that SAO (the first part) is the main part of this anime I would say. However ALO is not that bad at all. The thoughts from first part are continuing but in a bit different ways. Again a bit of psyche analysis. Story is continual in both of the parts and very good one as a whole piece I think. It may seem that ALO is just delay but contrary is the case. The fight is not over yet. 
Result
I really enjoyed this anime and it belongs to my favourites. This anime is gift for all online and even  offline gamers. Everyone can find something in there. (action, love, deep thoughts – my favourite, nice animation, oh I almost forgot and really amazing soundtrack)",10
"
                This show had a great premise about being trapped in a video game world, how it would affect players psychologically and how they would deal with this life or death situation.
However it quickly becomes another shallow love story with little to no character development, and the plot holes are too ostentatious to overlook.
I had high hopes, but overall I was disappointed, and by the end I didn't really care about the Kazuto/Asuna relationship, I could think about how sorry I felt for Suguha.

                Sword Art Online (or SAO) follows the story of a crazy game maker who traps all these kids in a virtual game, and tells them they have to beat their way out to make it out alive. If any other their family tries to take off the virtual simulator (in this case weird future helmet things), the system sends a shock to their brain and kills them automatically. Also, if they die while in game, they die in real life. Our main character is Kirito, who like everybody else, is fighting to get out of the game.
Story (5/10)
Ok so the concept is amazing. The idea
                  of a virtual game where you're actually IN the game is an idea that's sparked the interest and curiosity of many people. I was honestly so excited to watch this anime when my friend recommended it to me because the story just sounded so awesome, and for the first few episodes it really was. However, the story progresses in such a bad way I can't even think of an adjective to describe it. The first problem is when Kirito IMMEDIATELY GETS A RANDOM SUPER STRONG SWORD AND IS SEEMINGLY INVINCIBLE AND CANT FIGHT LITERALLY ANYTHING ALONE.  This makes the story lack any kind of suspense and basically Kirito watches all his weak friends die and he survives because of one random over powered sword. You think that's bad? Trust me it gets worse. He suddenly meets some also super strong over powered chic, and he tries fighting for her, but randomly loses to some guy who has an over powered shield (which blocks the super strong sword I guess), but in the span of 2 episodes suddenly Kirito and this girl are married and living together in the woods, and seem to have completely dropped the idea of (of shit I'm stuck in a game and could die any moment, we should hurry and gtfo). Anyway, a lot of other stupid stuff happens that makes you think ""wait I thought your life was at risk here"", and basically it's all just a big train wreck, and every interesting aspect drops out of the story.
Art (9/10)
If there is one thing I do like about this anime, its the art. All of the game graphics are amazing, and I love the detail and monsters and backgrounds and dungeons. I would probably play this game if it was real honestly. The fighting scenes are smooth, and the characters are designed nicely. 
Sound (9/10)
Again, the sound is fantastic. The OP and ending are great, and all of the sound effects and voice acting are on point.
Character (5/10)
As I talked about in the story section, there simply is no development in the characters, and everything that happens is pretty unrealistic. I actually found all of the side characters a lot more interesting than the main ones. All of the characters honestly act like they don't want to go home, and some even seem to be settling down in the game???? As if they don't have a real life??????????//
Enjoyment (5/10)
I dropped this anime. I liked it until it just got annoying and unrealistic and repetitive. 
Overall (5/10)
Spare yourself, and just don't watch this anime. It's extremely overrated. I don't know how it has so many seasons and episodes. I don't know why its so popular. The concept and art are great, but the execution lacks a lot.",5
"
                I think it was amazing the plot, but the character was less describable and i think they should of put more effort on describing about the character's.
Story:
The story 'plot' what really amazing for me since i like the idea that going in to a virtual rpg world and fighting for your life was really great idea. Also having the only sword and no magic was really interesting in a positive way. I think if they would of made the story longer it would really put a greater and an expansion to the SOA PROJECT.
Art & Sound:
Great art, the whole medieval days design was excellent made
                  me fell like it was the medieval times. The sound just made it twice the excitement of the fight and the cheesy parts of the series. The songs in the fights really got me into the fight it self and excites me like ""whats gonna happen next?"" and just gives me chills
Character:
Needs more background the the side characters and main, but i guess they couldn't fit everything into 25 episode. Overall character was outstanding.
Overall:
Overall i think it need more of an longer story and more fights. Better describe  of the main and side character. Overall its Amazing.",10

                ""Why is this person still writing a SAO review when there is already a second season of it?
 Don't you think it's way too late for this?""
If it was normal one, Yes. But luckily it isnt. I'm going to try in this review to say why SAO is such a big hit in the anime world and especially I hope to let the haters understand why people like me like/love the anime.
This review does include spoilers.
so first of all, my own opinion on the anime.
As i said before, im on the 'lovers' of the anime. It was the first anime i watched, so at that
                  time I had nothing else to compare it too. That could also be a reason why i just loved it. If i was going to review it at that time, it would be a 10 for everything likely.
But now time has passed and I have watched more animes, I'm beginning to understand why people hate/dislike it so much. Don't get me wrong, I still love the anime.
enjoyment: 9
This is pretty much where I'm going to explain to the haters why this anime is so popular. If you are going to read this part, I'm guessing either you are a lover or a hater, or in the grey side idc. what i expect from you either way is that you already have watched the anime ( pretty stupid to write this in a review, but im doing it anyway! )
So first of all, let's start why I liked it. The reason why I liked it is pretty simple. An MMORPG where you can live in where you can do whatever you want, as a gamer, IS F*****G AWESOME!. I mean, to get stuck in a game where you must game your way out, there is almost no better adventure game as that. So the idea alone was very exciting for me.
Now probably the reason why this anime was such a good show, is because of the main character: Kirito. He pretty much got the two things every gamer wants: skills and many girls. For 12-15 year old gamers, he is such a badass and so-ever, gets so many chicks by just saying hello to them, and screams in every fight like bruce lee does every time he punches and kicks something. 
Story: 4
The story is rushed, you miss a lot of information and it kind of shows you the wrong things. I mean, some episodes felt like they weren't necessary, while on the other side I missed some episodes. There were a lot of things going on in the anime that were not particulary relevant. There were a lot of time lapses that shouldnt be there, because you missed a lot of information there. 
example + spoiler:
after Kirito, the main character, gets stuck in the game and knows that if he die in the game, he dies in real life, the episode ends a few minutes after. the next episode it is a MONTH LATER. I mean come on, there was so much potential to write about what happened in the FIRST MONTH. based on the story, the show definitely dissapointed me, because it could have been so much better.
Art + sound average: 9
especially the soundtrack is awesome, op and ed are amazing as well, ty!
character: 4
As i said before, because of the timelapses you miss a lot of information. There are about 2 main characters in the story.
- Kirito. He is the male and savior of the game. He went from a techno nerd in real life to a badass nuts kicker in the game who pretty much can 1vs6 without dealing dmg 
(It really happens in the show -,- ) Somehow all the girls in the game get attracted to him and it kinda turns out to be a harem, without really knowing all the girls ( you see each one of them for one episode, excluding the main one, Asuna)
- Asuna. pretty much the female type of Kirito, just like him pretty good in the game and kicking ass ( not as clever and good as kirito). She ends up being the boyfriend of Kirito in a pretty stylish way, sarcasm overload :p
no really, that went fast as a elephant ranning away from a mouse.... ( lame joke -,-)
overall: still an 8
Let it be clear that you shouldnt take the story to serious, it is just the action and badass scenes that makes this anime so good and loved by a lot of younger people who just want to watch something cool, instead of something interesting, if you know what i mean. I dont want to offend all younger people, but i think this is just how it is. tell me if im wrong just pm me then :)",8
"
                i have nothing much to say about this anime. People give it alot of bad reviews, and i can see why for many reason. but those reason a pretty much my own opinion which i not really going to wast my time sharing.
I personally think the series was very good. yes i read some of the book so there are things that make more sense in the book than the anime. Sometime can be confusing to some, some episode may be though of "" whats the point of showing me that"" and  many other things didnt make sense. 
For all those negative reviews I've
                  seen and read, they are not wrong. but thats because they were like judging everything the the series. the last time i check if you judge every damn details in something then i doubt any movie series of any genre would be good cause there is always something bad about them. 
Anyways, in the end. watch the series and judge it for you self. it all a matter of ones opinion in the end. i wont recommend it to those who need to have everything explained to them. But for those who play games, who watch ""dot hack (.Hack)"" or for those who like survival adventures, give it a try and judge it for yourself.
(Everything after this is just the reason i give it 10)
I gived it a 10 only because its been a while that an anime  made me want to watch it and finish. ive seen many good anime. but majority of them is always a repeats. what made sword art different, well yes it kinda of a repeat in a different aspect but its not something thats has not been done. I mean think of the matrix, .Hack or  ghost in the shell ( not fully the same but the ideas are still there).  
In the end it was the adventure adventure, the felling of what would you do if something had to happen to you. And finally it relates to many of us MMORPG player, Many of us (World of Warcraft, Eve online, etc....)
And finally the main reason which might be only me. It absorbed me into the main story ( not the side story since they were not really complete in the end, since many were lost in there purpose) which usualyl happens very rarely. Sometime i tend to drop many who started good or take a few years to finish some of them.
OVERALL 
Watch it and judge it yourself. Don't let some guys who comment bad on something to tell you whats good and what is bad. We are all different individual, our opinion are different no matter what how similar someone can be to you. You might like what you see. and if every you want to understand what really going on, then read the novel, this will differently fill in the gaps that are missing. But for those who don't like reading the anime concludes the story very well in my opinion.",10
"
                Rating this anime is  overall is a very hard thing to do, the first half was gold, I loved it immensely. The plot was awesome and I really liked the whole concept. The plot twist at the end of the Aincrad arc was a little unforeseen and rushed but the first half still deserves a 9.5/10. As for the ALfheim arc (second half); I don't even know what the fuck the director was thinking. The whole thing incest thing made me throw up, and at first I suspected it had another director, because whoever the fuck thought up the plot probably never played a
                  fucking video game in his/her whole life. One does not simply start playing a MMO, make a beeline to the last quest, finish it in 2 tries, use an admin hack and win the fucking game. Art and sound weren't bad but I would give it a 2 for its plot.
Conclusion: Just watch to episode 14 and stop. If you want to know what happens after, go read a online summary or keep reading and I'll sum it up for you quickly.
ALfheim Online in a Nutshell: Asuna doesn't wake up after players are allowed to log out. It turns out she was transferred into another un-log-outable game so Kirito goes into that game to same her from her pedophile fiancé, who made the game to rape her. (Wot m8? >.>) In the game Kirito meets up with his sister and her nerd friend and they go do the hardest quest in the game to save Asuna but at the end the GM (aka the rapist fiancé) shows up and tortures Kirito while raping Asuna(DAFUQ?). But then the creator of Aincrad comes out of the blue and tells Kirito a Admin hack that has higher authority than the GM (GM means Game Master if you didn't know) which Kirito then used to fuck up that pedo and save Asuna.
That might have been a little off because I haven't seen it in ages but I hope you guys generally get the idea of why I want people to stay away from the second half. Just trust me it's worse than cancer.",5
"
                ""It's not SWO unless the creators ruin a nice and touching story with a serial rapist!""
Seriously, this should be renamed to Serial Rapist Online. The anime starts out so well! People are trapped in a MMORPG and need to win in order to get out. Should be fun right? Well, it is fun exactly until the main hero wins that game. After that story arc, get ready for the story to be ruined with rape scenes. There's going to be 2 story arcs after the 1st one, which are simply ruined by the needless harassment scenes. I'm okay with fan service, but this isn't fan
                  service, this is messed up! God, it was disgusting!
After that however, the last 2 story arcs are perfect. I swear to god I was so happy they didn't ruin those, especially the last one. I almost cried. They're full of feels and tears. Gee, why did it take them so long to get it right? At times it did feel like they were going a bit overboard, but it somehow suited the whole setting.
If it wasn't for these last two stories, I'd probably give this a score below 5, because the anime really doesn't offer much else. The fights are well animated, but there's not much to them besides eye candy. Naturally, as a reward, the hero gets his harem, too! Just thinking about the sheer amount of wasted potential this anime had makes me mad.
Nevertheless, it's still very good and enjoyable to watch. If all else fails, just skip the lewd stuff in the episodes, because the second half of the second season is where the fun is. Because of those last 2 story arcs it is worth watching.
One more minor thing about one of those story arcs though: one of them did feel like a filler. For once the characters were playing some MMORPG just for the fun of it and nothing of big importance happened. Some could consider it boring, but in the context of this anime, I was just glad I finally got something normal.
Here's hope they don't mess up season 3.",8
"
                Ah!..... Sword Art Online, the anime I just love to hate. This is an anime where the angry rant reviews are more fun to read than watching the anime itself. This is a highly polarising anime. Which means there are hardcore fans who worship it and angry haters who are willing to wipe it off the face of Earth. 
I am one those haters, and this review will contain some major spoilers. 
Let's start with the good part. The first episode and the background images. That's it. Nothing else. 
The story is divided into two arcs. The first arc starts with our hero Kirito logging
                  in the Sword Art Online game using a virtual reality helmet which allows players to control their avatars with their minds. It's a VRMMORPG game that sold only 10000 copies(not much profit in it, is there?)
Soon after, Kirito and his newly made online friend Klein find themselves unable to log out. The villain announces that he has trapped all the players in the game. The only way to get out is beating all 100 floors. If they die in game or try to forcibly remove the helmet they die in real life. 
Playing MMORPG is no longer fun and one would expect to see an epic survival story with awesome battles. But no, SAO says 'fuck you' to all that.
Instead what we get are stupid characters, wtf plot conveniencies, major time skips, forced romance, harem, cheap drama and the oh-so-cool badass stupid kirito....oh and fanservice to complete the circle. 
The first two episodes were good. Kirito swears to free all the players...SOLO!!! How the hell can someone complete an MMORPG by soloing!!! Then we have a sudden major timeskip and Kirito is suddenly an overpowered badass high level player and more than half the game is complete. Where are the boss battles? 4000 players have died? How and when did they die? They just say that and expect us to believe it. If that's not lazy I don't know what is.
The characters are easily the worst. They are mostly girls who exist only to add to Kirito's harem. They have no personality and no reason to exist other than say how cool and heroic Kirito is. Even Asuna, who actually was a promising character in the first two episodes falls prey to it and become the most bland and stupid female characters I have ever seen. There is also the incestous sister/cousin Suguha and Asuna becomes rape material in the second arc. Every other side characters don't get enough screentime for me to actually remember their names. 
Kirito is the very definition of how NOT to make a character. He has absolutely no personality and his only defining feature is that he is overpowered. He can win any fight within seconds. Everyone loves him, everyone wants to be him. That takes away any tension the anime has to offer. Because there is no way the hero can lose. He is the wish-fulfilment character you commonly find in hentais.
There is forced romance between Kirito and Asuna involving marriage, sex, honeymoon, and adopting a rouge AI daughter(Dafaq), while people are dying trying to clear the game. They are supposed to the protagonists?
The villains are stupid as hell. The first villain forgot what his motivations or goal was by trapping and killing thousands of people. This would have been acceptible if the anime acknowleged that it was bad. But they showed it as something DEEP and philosophical. How the fuck is something like mass murder philosophical!!! 
The second villain is a complete joke. But he has some motivation...trapping Asuna in a cage and raping her?(yup, nice use of power and money) I personally liked him better because he was able to stab Kirito and make him bleed(YEAH*fistpump*)
For something that calls itself an action anime it has a huge deficiet of action. There are few fights and even fewer fights that contribute anythong to the plot. Most fights are over within 30 seconds with Kirito overpowering them. No tactics, no strategy, no effort. This anime seems to have forgotten that this is a MMORPG game where working together as a team is the only way to play. 
Also, the plot holes? Like Asuna somehow be able to move after being paralyzed? Kirito coming back to life after dying? The freaking in-game war between two races in the second arc (WTF)? People using the same technology as SAO to play another game just as dangerous? My suspension of disbelief can only go so far!!! 
Is there anything in this anime that I actually liked? Yes. The over the top expressions when they fight, the hilariously stupid dialogue and Suguha's love triangle involving her brother and his online avatar(I laughed at it so hard i even gave it a name- THE TROLL TRIANGLE).... Oh and kirito getting stabbed(YEAH*fistpump*) 
Overall, it's a complete waste of time. It's insulting, offending and only appeals to people who have never played any MMORPG or seen any action anime or is just a plain loser.
P:S- What makes me even more angry is that this anime has a large number of hardcore fans. They go as far as saying that it is the smartest anime they have seen and other animes should learn from it. What they actually see in this anime will always be beyond my comprehension.",3

                Aaahhhh every other review stinks lol. This used to be one of my favorite animes but I agree with pretty much every other review :P i'm not sure if i like the anime as much anymore lol. I still like it and remember my time watching it pretty fondly, those reviews just sort of pushed down my rating cause it opened me to the truth. Don't get me wrong it was still good :)
~6~
Story: This was actually pretty smart and I enjoyed it. The idea of being trapped inside an mmorpg is pretty smart. I know it wasn't the first one of it but it
                  sure did it pretty well. All the menus and skill points to invest in. Not to mention 100 floors (which we only saw about 22) with lots of items and special places. It looked amazing at first looked perfect but that time skipped shocked me. I managed to get over it and continue to enjoy it. But they went from floor 2 or 3 in the main story line hit a bunch of filler and ended on floor 50 at christmas. Half the first arc was spend hiding in the forest on vacation and spent in fillers, sort of necessary but wasted those precious episodes making me wonder why I was wwaiting for the next episodes. Pretty much the worst thing happened that left the main character alive every single time... it got predictable.
~10~
Art: This was one part I really enjoyed. Seeing the towns and landscape in HD was pretty cool :). They did a very good job with the ""skills"" for their swords and the landscape in the first episode was a cool scene. I loved the towns around Christmas time, but other than that most of the towns looked the same all throughout the first arc. The second arc introduced flying which bugged me but I also enjoyed it. I had gotten used to ""almost no magic"" in the first arc that all the spells and flying made me sad at first xD. They did an ok job of incorporating the flying into the fights, it was mostly just for looks.
~9~
Sound: I usually don't pay to much attention to the sound except for a few main songs. But I noticed a few main themes in here that fit the situation well and sounded good, so it was fine :)
~5~
Character: This is the part where i truly agree with other reviews. At first I was like WOW! hes really cool!!! And wow they look good together. Then I was like wow.... hes op wow... whats a girl looking like that doing playing a nerdy kind of game. Lol pretty unrealistic. I mean kirito was enjoyable to watch in his fights but it got to the point of you can do what entire armies can't by yourself!!! and you're one of the games strongest players after 2 days.... wtf? Other than that no one else was a main character except for klein...
~8~
Enjoyment: I'm also pretty biased here. I loved the art so much and the fights were pretty BA that it made up for the other areas. The second arc doesn't feel the same but the first arc was memorable! True it should have had more bosses but the ones you saw the players fight were (mostly) a pleasure. And I still love the idea of having the menu and items with equipment, :P I'm just a sucker for that. 
~8~
Overall: Lol I would have given it a 9.5 if it were available but the other reviews changed my view some. The characters weren't that good and the story was ok. But the art overall idea and occasional boss fight made up for it!",8

                Sword art online
At the start:
Ahh fck this is epic, brings back memories of the MMos i played
Episode 2-6:
Woah a whole month has passed. Not what i expected but, interesting.
Episode 7-13:
Alright Episode 14:
Wtf
Episode 15-25:
Not worth watching. Damn it couldve been so much better",5
"
                I heard about this anime from my friends who all raved that it was the best anime they'd ever seen, this anime was the SHIT. The fucking anime to beat all anime, the supreme anime. I suppose the hype could be one reason this anime turned into an absolute disaster for me. This anime started out to be very promising and had me hooked from the first couple of episodes and i was like, ""Yeah, yeah I could really dig this."" And then BOOM, a head shot to the anime arrived almost immediately after exiting the first game, SAO, but that did not stop this
                  hulking disaster from destroying any connection I had to these characters. My recommendation, watch episodes 1-15 and then drop this anime like a hot fucking potato before you get disappointed at how HARD this anime falls off. 
TL;DR watch episodes 1-15, 15-25 are seriously lower in quality.

                I have extremely high hopes for this anime. I love MMORPG's and this anime takes that dream of all gamers and turns it into reality. I have only seen the first episode but I am very excited. The story sounds so interesting. The look is very appealing, and other then that little gay moment they had between Kirito and Cline the characters are magnificent. I absolutely loved episode one and cannot wait for episode two. I recommend everyone to watch this, and if you like this, check out Accel World. (Although I think this is way better)

                Sword Art Online's premise is a fascinating one. It promises for a great story, but ultimately fails due to typical failures faced by many animes.
The show centralizes on the story of people trapped in a virtual reality game. The seemingly innocent and fun game has suddenly become a nightmare; everyone must fight to survive.
Now, to this point the show seems extremely promising. It is a plot which forces the characters to experience what human nature truly is. Are humans innately good? Are they all selfish? What does it truly mean to be human?
At this point, I am sure any reader is confused as to why
                  I have given this show a bad rating and call it a failure. I will divide my critics into these sections: character, romance, unnecessary plot/items, typical hero, endings, and incest.
Character: At the beginning, character development is extremely key. We're introduced to many people, including the main character, but we still don't know them. This allows for suspense as the viewer does not know how people will act in certain situations. I consider this a good thing, it keeps us on our toes and makes everything unexpected. However, after a point, SAO completely abandons this and becomes ""here's a character, now you know everything about them."" Characters do not develop as everything has been presented to us.
Romance: There is a point in the show where romance takes over the story completely. I am unsure what the decision behind this was, but it was extremely forced. The reality of death is forgotten and the original story crumbles. I think this was fan service and fan service always kills things.
Unnecessary plot/items: A character is introduced that is a child. Clearly, she is added to the story for the ""cute/loli"" aspect, hoping to attract those people who are very much into that. This character serves no purpose and is rammed into the story line, ultimately serving no real important value. (I can not delve deeper or reveal the name as they would be spoilers).
Typical Hero: At the beginning, our main protagonist is very human. He makes mistakes, he has doubts, he shows all the things you'd expect from a human being. That is, until a few episodes in. Suddenly, he's the best swordsman around. And if there are unwinnable situations, he keeps going or powers up...or whatever cliche hero thing you can think of. Suddenly, he becomes every hero in every anime.
Ending: SAO has a point that it should have ended. It was already falling apart, but clearly fame and fortune was dragging it on. We go through another arc of ""online gaming"", but this time there is no grittiness that came with the base SAO. It's truly just became another bargain bin anime at this point.
Incest: There is a point in this series that introduces the idea of incest and brother/sister love. I can not see how this aids in the plot or is important. This, to me, seems as though it was placed to entertain some of the more perverted people in the fan base.
SAO seems to have run out of ideas and struggled to keep itself going. As the story faded, they tried to reach out to a wider audience by forcibly adding irrelevant content. 
I would not recommend this series to anyone.",3

                There’s a reason why it’s famous………
About the STORY
As it is after-all a role playing game story so the series is packed with action and adventures. It’s quite educational for people with zero knowledge with this kind of industry as there are tons of details about anything about Role-Playing-Game. As it is a survival story, the drama is quite in the heavy side but nevertheless, it is still accompanied with light elements such the nicely made romance part of it.
About the CHARACTERS
The two main characters are quite rare combination because it’s not very often you see both male and female protagonists who equally can kick butts
                  as it is usually the cliché “knight and shining armor plus damsel in distress” kind of set-up. It is refreshing to see both on fair and equal roles. Each characters’ role whether protagonists, antagonists, and even the second characters are well-executed.
About the ANIMATION
The animation is no doubt one of the top of today’s famous series. There are extremely cool fights and beautiful landscapes. The character designs are well-made although; they kind of look like characters from a slice of life series. The impression of all-so-cool action/adventure looks are lacking or in this case, different. Well, as the series progresses it doesn’t matter already. 
About the ENJOYMENT
Virtual worlds and role playing games or rather being in a fictional world are probably not only dreamed by game otakus but almost all anime otakus as well who dream at least once to experience a fictional world where there are powers or weapons to use and villains to fight. This series is the epitome of that dream and I believe in all fairness this series is able to justify and features drama that comes with it. And although the characters look so cute for a shounen action series, their strong and admiring personalities still made them cool. Plus, you get two different adventures in one series.",8
"
                Story:
well, the story is quite simple: an Internationale RPG game has finally been released (Sword Art Online) and tons of players can't wait to play it, but when they got to the game they eventually realized that they couldn't log out and if they try to remove the console in which they're playing the game in their brains will get microwaved, the only way to log out of the game safely is by finishing all 100 levels of the game, so of course this causes a lot of problems for people who are stuck.
I personally liked the reactions of the players, they seemed... real. i
                  mean, at first their only objective was only to finish the game but when they realized that this would a longer time they began to gradually become accustomed to this world, i mean, after spending a year or two you'll get used to how the system, and that's realistic, but that doesn't mean you have to like it, you'll just have to accept it if you wanna finish the game and that's fair, i guess. Of course, after awhile, there are those people who give up on completing the game and make a living in this world, some press forward and team up (guilds or parties) to end the game, and some even commit suicide, those are all realistic people reactions. That's the part this anime focuses on the most rather than the actual completion of the game, and personally, this is more fun. Although the second half wasn't as good as the first one.
Art:
I really appreciated the art in this anime. The art is new, i mean, you can't mistake it with an old anime. I don't know if its considired part of the art, but the fight scenes are really great. Also, the character drawing is good, i mean, the women look hot and the guys look cool in an anime way; big eyes and all that stuff.
Sound:
The voice-acting is top class class; you can really feel the characters anger, hate, desperasion and all those other emotions through their voices. The music is really great, i mean, the battle music really gets you hyped up and they fit well with the anime's image. To be honest i didn't focus much on the songs, but i guess they're a good hear.
Characters:
This is probably the main reason why i gave this anime such a great rating. i honestly don't where to start. Let's talk about the main character of this story, Kirigaya Kazuto, or as you'll know him as Kirito-kun. He is one of those hard-headed guys who sees himself as the loner who needs to do his jobs alone to be efficient but is very heroic at times, yet he has his fair share of flaws, so you know he's not perfect. Basically, he's AWESOME.
Overall:
I did enjoy this anime very much, it was a great way to waste my time. and of course it had minor flaws, but overall i don't regret giving this anime a 10/10. :)",10

                I know what you're thinking... another SAO review?? WELL GUESS WHAT... You may as well bite your NerveGear, cuz i'm going in dry.
SAO is a continuous downward spiral. However, I will try not to forget that it was quite interesting at one point. Even though they weren't perfect, I thought the first 14 episodes were a complete joy to watch- mainly in terms of aesthetics. 
The action is very engaging, dazzling, and composed in a way to make it feel epic. As a gamer, i really liked seeing the items, abilities, and stats of the characters as they developed. And yet, the anime was not
                  completely focused around that. Lets not forget that the animation itself is awful purdy too.
The main plot was very simple and left little room for big twists (yes, even episode 14, don't act like you didn't see that coming). However, I think it was cool on a conceptual level. The subplots kinda kept it alive IN THE BEGINNING because they were still valid. They were about discovering the world and the people in it. As the show went on, they became filler and completely pointless and forgettable. Really, the same thing happens in the main plot when starting episode 15. I just stopped caring. SAO started trying to be something that it wasn't. While I enjoyed the first half (and so incessantly remind you), I will point out that is was very rushed. You jump from thing to thing and inevitably feel left out. 
While all the characters in SAO are somewhat one-dimentional, they are still memorable. My main quarrel, however, is with the main character Kirito. He's just so bland. Yeah, he might get all mad and worked up during a fighting scene, but I never saw a lot of internal conflicts... OR EVEN WORTHY PHYSICAL CONFLICTS FOR THAT MATTER. He is the stereotypically perfect hero who is unmatched in power and will. Just plain OP. Never saw him develop that much.
If you're like me, romance is always a nice touch. And at first, SAO presented it fairly well. There were a lot of cute moments within Kirito's harem of blacksmiths and druids. I like romance where there is a definitive choice so was fun seeing him grow with Asuna... at first. Yeah, this romance was good until the show started emphasizing it. It became something cheesy, forced, and kinda ridiculous. I know their kid was basically a plot device, but OH FUCKING BROTHER. And then the awkward incestuous subplot with his sister... why bother at that point? 
idk guys... to be honest, this one wasn't that great, but i liked it.",7

                Sword Art Online is, without a doubt, one of the best anime series I have ever seen.
If you're not an MMO gamer or you don't know MMO gamers, you probably won't get a lot of the story as it is presented to you. SAO, first and foremost, takes place almost entirely inside a VRMMORPG, and the leitmotif, like that of .hack/sign, is one entirely open to interpretation. SAO does something extraordinary by bringing the fundamental issues of MMOs, especially one as dangerous as the one they end up in, to the forefront at all the right times, and executing them perfectly. This is the all-important
                  plot element that separates SAO from your typical, high-budget shovelware shonen-action anime, and brings it around to a well-balanced, psychological piece that can really make you wonder. The story is wonderfully executed and comes together in a stylish package that draws you into the action and emotion beautifully.
Some of SAO's characters seem to be lacking a bit, but I don't mind too much, especially when, even if they're featured for an episode and then thrown away, they are at least interesting and keep you watching through the filler. Rest assured, though, that there isn't much of that. Some of the most important plot elements of SAO come from the filler, which, while odd, at least helps everything to serve some purpose. The main character, Kirito, is for all intents of purposes, very typical as a shonen hero; beat the game, save the girl, etc. But his reaction to events is what makes him so easy to watch. He's got all the hallmarks of a stereotypical swordsman lead, without any of the drawbacks that come with being a stereotypical swordsman lead. In many ways, his attitude reflects the sense of urgency you will no doubt feel through the interactions of the characters as the series continues on, which is the very element that makes it so easy to get drawn in and distract you from the few glaring flaws SAO has against it.
The artwork is fantastic, decadent and crystal-clear, with vibrant, vivid color and imagery set to a fantasy background that somehow feels close to real without ever even approaching it. Animation is at an all-time high, especially for the epic look and feel of the boss battles, which, again, hold a much greater sense of urgency than that of any other shonen-action anime you'll see. As a matter of fact, the only thing I can scrutinize here is the character design, which is really enough to make most people think that it's nothing more than another typical shonen action anime. The designs do, however, work really well with the other elements of the design, 
which makes up for it quite a lot and helps you to forget the flaws rather than point them out.
The sound work isn't bad at all. I felt the voice actors did an excellent job of conveying the tension and high emotion necessary for the series to continue forward the way it needed to. On the other hand, the music is pretty blah. There are some great high-tension moments and the soundtrack accurately sets the mood for every waking moment, so the sound direction is very well placed, but all of the backing music feels like I've heard it before. Thankfully they didn't go with a whole lot of cheesy heavy metal guitar riffs, as you'll hear from a lot of other anime in its class, but SAO's sound work does leave much to be desired.
Even the little things not perfectly executed in this series don't leave enough to be desired that SAO isn't highly enjoyable and recommendable. Definitely give it a go if you like your shonen-action with a little bit more of an adult sense of direction, and absolutely give it a go if you're looking for something close to what .hack/sign should have been.",9

                [The Good]
1. The attention to detail. 
A lot of the game icons, the interface, and the actions are very similar to what actual video games are like.
-Healthbars
-Regeneration
-How leveling works
-Skills.
2. ActionWhile the action is PG13, it is done very well into the lore and relation to how games work. I won't give it points for choreography, but I will for the animation quality.
-SAO-the original world, was a lot better than alfheim in this regard.
-Most of the action is true to the ""classic"" rpg style.
3. Animation. 
Now i'm not gonna lie, the animation isn't top quality or stylized. This isn't SNK or KLK or whatever else I could list out(seriously i love animationt). BUT the animation is solid for most of the show and is well done in most of the fights. There are some pretty obvious dips in quality, but it's to be expected.
The animation quality in alfheim just divebombed though.
====================================
[The Weird]
/SAO
1. The idea of traps wouldn't be much fun tbh.
/After SAO
-First off no action was taken against a company/device that killed hundreds of people
-Second, kirito is weak but asuna's fine?
/Alfheim
1. Racism. 
There is an absurd amount of implied racism in Alfheim. Literally every non-same race person is commenting on the other person's race in an insulting manner. Why is this even a thing? they both look exactly alike too.
2. Parties. 
So in Alfheim escorting a noobie to a main area is ""betraying the guild"". I'm not sure how but this seems like a pointless hate. I mean that's like saying ""oh you are escorting a newbie to a raid in a horde territory? YOU CLEARLY ARE BETRAYING THE ALLIANCE"".
-It just caught me as really stupid.
3. Marriage 
The whole thing with Asuna marrying some guy while in a coma. Yeah....that was kinda stupid.
=======================================
[The Bad]
1. Game Design
I could make a whole thread on this alone but it boils down to three major things.
-No tutorial
-Meaning SAO is designed as a Trial-and-Error.(meaning you are SUPPOSED to die).
-Even in normal mmorpg's you are usually led to die at least once so that you don't reach max level not knowing what happens after you die.
+ This is just SAO. Alfheim was such a shitty game It would take me a whole page to explain how awful it was in basic game design.
2. Inconsistency.
-Kirito can move at instantaneous speeds, but then he can't later. 
A) He runs up this huge wall at a ridiculous speed in SAO, then he's slow as balls everywhere else.
B) In Alfheim he literally teleports in the start, but then in a later fight he has trouble with a 3-shield group who can be avoided since the area is rather large, but he charges straight at them and fails.
-Kirito is super powerful, now he's not.
A) Kirito can regen hp in a pvp fight, but the next pvp fight he can't.
B) In alfheim kirito transforms into a giant beast, but then can't do it again.
C) Kirito can get stabbed in the face and be fine, but depending upon the guy, it could be life-threatening.
3. Plot.
-It's all awful. From SAO to Alfheim everything is pretty overdone.
4. Overhype.
-The anime barely beats other mediocre shows but it's hyped to be this great anime. Don't understand why, since the anime as-is doesn't beat anything THIS season, much less does it contend with the ""best of"" in any of the season's prior.
-I'm not joking. Black bullet, Jojo's, whatever comes out that is mid-popular blows SAO away in every regard, and that's not even counting the ""best of"" the season's.
5. Half the Anime was terrible.
-Alheim takes up half the season, which makes the show a lot worse than just dropping it at SAO.
6. Asuna with the whole ""i'm going to rape you"" thing in Alfheim. I can deal with a single scene of this but the same guy for like 5+ episodes? Come on, that's just insensitive.
7. Players don't act like gamers but like NPC's.
=================================================
Final thoughts
SAO isn't terrible. It's not great either. It's just mediocre. It doesn't have any aspirations to present original ideas, but it does have good animation and a good design.
""A decent looking virtual reality with sword fighting"" would sum up all the positives.
""A video game anime made by someone who doesn't play video games"" would sum up all the complaints I have with it.
I give it a 5/10.",5
"
                Was initially skeptical about SAO; I had an aversion to any anime set in a video game because I assumed they would all be super-cheesy. Then I watched SAO and Log Horizon and saw what I was missing.
Story & Character: I really enjoyed the first arc; it had a lot of build-up and tension, tragedy, and all the things that make an anime worth watching. None of the characters seemed pushed or unnecessary and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I didn't much care for the second arc, but the characters continued to develop so it's OK. I haven't watched SAO 2 yet (I like to wait
                  until they're finished so I can binge watch), but I hope it stays consistent.
Art & Sound: I enjoyed the OST, I have a few of the songs in my library; the animation is fluid and nice-looking but not groundbreaking by any means.
Enjoyment: Had the second arc been better I would probably have enjoyed it a lot more; but it's definitely a solid anime that I do not regret watching.",8
"
                  I am very aware of the controversial hatel this anime has produced among the community, it is almost quite sad. This is I think is a series you will either deem one of the most spectacular series to grace the medium, or something you will hate, depending on your tastes in certain hobbies. If you’re a video gamer at heart, you will probably just feel as though your being swept away into an immerse experience that won’t let go especially if your have never seen an anime marketed towards the video game virtual reality. I was so intrigued to watch this, after seeing
                  MAL’s 10+ reviews just after watching 1 episode. How the hell can anyone judge an anime after 1 episode? Well read on and you will soon find out why this series is one of the most talked bout series of 2012 and still is even this year. This is a show that will  giving a lasting impression in this generation and possibly even the next generation.
Have you ever wanted to live in a virtual world where you can fight monsters and clear dungeons while meeting thousands of players online? Sword Art Online is a story about just that. It starts out with ten-thousand players all logging into the greatest virtual reality MMO game of all time: Sword Art Online. Kirito, the protagonist of the anime, is a beta tester of the game and has more knowledge about the game than most. While this school aged kid wanders around the world of Aincrad, he notices that it is not possible to log out. Soon afterward, all players are teleported to the main area of the game. The GM, or game moderator Kayaba Akihiko, appears to tell all of them about the game: They cannot log out until all one-hundred floors are cleared as well as if they die in the game, they die in the real world. All players then go into a complete panic and replicate their true selves. Sword Art Online then begins as a trial for everyone's lives.
Kirito also faces a daunting challenge emotionally, as the stakes are exceptionally high. A death in-game equates to death in real life. These obstacles flesh out the human nature of Kirito’s character in great detail. His behavior, emotions and actions are closely related to his recent happenings and experiences. Kirito starts off as a social recluse who prefers to limit his interactions with other people. This leads him to shun the cooperative nature of MMORPGs and plays solo. Through a chance encounter, Kirito manages to befriend a group and re-learn the significance of friendship and comradeship, and how that improves his mental well-being. This does not lead to the unrealistic result of Kirito becoming instantly socially adept, as he faces further obstacles and setbacks that push him back to his reclusive old self. Such flaws truly show that Kirito is simply a mere mortal with variable emotions and feelings, which serves to connect with the viewer with empathy. For Kirito is only the strongest player in SAO due to his effort and research, rather than simply being perfect. Only through real experience can Kirito grow as a person, and the growth is closely tied in with the story.
We are therefore treated to relevant side stories instead of level-grinding filler. Each of these side stories involves an encounter with a supporting cast with wide variations in personalities and nature of the quest. Through the use of variety in the story, not only do we get to see Kirito develop, but also the world. The viewer is introduced to the world of MMORPGs involving Guilds, Raids, Smithing, Conspiracy and even a compelling virtual romance that becomes the foundation of a timely rejuvenation of Kirito’s character and part of the core element of the story. Asuna’s the main heroine worldview is also seamlessly influenced, and improved. The two-way nature of the relationship really makes it convincing, and leaves a lasting impression. The end product is an Asuna, despite her obvious flaws as a human, becomes a character whom many would look up to, due to her dedicated and faithful nature that was born out of hardship.
 The writers performed an exceptional job. The accurate portrayal of human emotions, and especially during the years of adolescence really brings the show to life. The level of language, and the tones used by the voice actors were highly appropriate. The quality of writing continues with the way the villains are portrayed. The first major villain, Kayaba is an accurate rendition of the genius, lost in his own world, which he seeked to control. He is the prime example of a person termed as a sociopath. The best aspect of him however is not his character itself, but the way he integrated himself into the story line, and produced the most unexpected plot twist. This twist is a very crafty and convincing one due to it being totally out of the blue.
Although show is somewhat lacking in all-out battle action which comes across as strange, due to its highly suggestive title; the art of sword-craft, the worry is misplaced. The rarity of such scenes only serves to enhance the excitement during the boss battles. The immersion is further exemplified by the convincing use of light effects during animated scenes. This highly appropriate use of animation technique serves to amplify the effect of each, and every single hacking and slicing motion.  
SAO attempts to provide a realistic and varied portrayal of the world of MMORPGS. The Animation is outstanding. The design of the scenery is complex and detailed, as well as each and every character you come across. Of course, this does not always apply to the minor appearances, but they are certainly detailed enough for simple presentation. With that  being said, the art is rightly represented by smooth and realistic animation that will have you struck in awe as Kirito and others pull off some of the most exciting works of swordplay in history. Everything about the way SAO looks is more then wonderful enough to leave a permanent image print in your mind.
Kajiura Yuki who worked on the music. (Another reason’s why I highly praise the music in this series. The style of the music resembles her most recent previous work (Fate/Zero), but is sufficiently different to set it apart, reminiscent of the time she worked on Mai-HiME and Tsubasa Chronicles back-to-back. She is one of my favorite composers and her music really brings every scenario and event to life. In this series she instead utilizes a greater reliance on classic instruments and the orchestra. A highly appropriate decision as the art of swordsmanship and the resulting sword fights are traditional in nature. Despite classical instruments being rather ‘soft’ in comparison with electronic music, Kajiura delivered beautifully with the softer style actually multiplying the effectiveness of the battle scenes. Her mix of opera in the battle tracks only serves to give a sense of ‘epicness” and an intense adrenaline rush.
The voice acting is unbelievably emotional and real. Hearing all of the voices from everyone will make you feel as if you're in their position. Sword Art Online would definitely not be the same without the wonderful sounds that you hear while watching it. I will say that the English Dubbing licensed by Aniplex is pretty exceptional, so if you’re the kind of viewer that don’t like the original Japanese, then the English sports a pretty good cast of characters, particularly Kirito and Asana. I myself prefer the Japanese, I think the emotion that is portrayed throughout many of the voice acting roles are more convincing. But to each their own, either way sub or dub, this anime is a must watch.
In conclusion the excellence of the individual components ( sound, animation) come together at the end to give the viewer an anime that is pleasant to see, awe-inspiring to hear, and minds in intrigue with the story. A1 Pictures has successfully created an adaptation that entertains a wide variety of audiences. SAO is a must watch for fans of adventure, fantasy, and even romance. A truly enjoyable series that crosses an extremely wide range of anime fan bases which is a hard feat to pull off.  Sword Art Online is definitely one of the greatest and promising pieces of Japanese animation to exist in the year 2012. Anything that can make you love, hate, cry, and rejoice the way that Sword Art Online does is going to be hard to beat and for fans that are video gamers alike, I think they will appreciate this series even more so. The product’s success is clearly seen through pure, objective evidence by means of Blu-Ray sales as viewers have overwhelmingly embraced SAO.",9

                Sword Art Online, an anime produced by A-1 Pictures, was a highly anticipated show that focused on gamers trapped inside of a virtual reality MMORPG with their real lives at stake. Unfortunately its plot lacked pacing, had inconsistent characters, and a poorly written romance. The main character, Kirito, has a “blank slate” personality, solely, for the purpose of allowing viewers to insert themselves in his place. This allows the writers to literally revolve around pandering to the audience, as all of the characters, plot points, and situations only exist to make Kirito look as “bad-ass” as possible.
Naturally, the relationships in this show are nothing short
                  of a harem, as Kirito essentially attracts every female character he meets (more pandering and self-insertion). The main female character Asuna had some actual potential to be an interesting character, until she partook in the horribly forced romance between her and Kirito, even becoming just a “damsel in distress” at one point.
Naturally, there are plenty of convenient plot contrivances in which Kirito actually breaks the rules of the game without any explanation as to how. Deus ex Machinas become used so often, that Kirito himself even begins to believe that he is beyond the games rules, when he literally tries to penetrate an invisible boundary, even after just being told by an admin sprite that the boundary is impenetrable.
Naturally, the fan service in this show is constantly exploited using deliberate camera angles to get an “ass shot”, if you will. If the writers wanted you to take the relationship between Kirito and Asuna seriously, then why did they continuously show unnecessary angles of her ass at every opportunity they had? Because they have no respect for your intelligence, they know most people just eat it up, and the story is not interesting enough that you would feel distracted from something actually important happening.
With all of this aside, there is something to be said about the excitement of the concept holding some real potential. As an avid MMORPG player myself, I understand that there was some actually interesting gaming allusions and innuendos such as the ambiguity of genders, beta testers, quests, dungeons, raids, and parties. I mean there is nothing ground breaking or revolutionary here, like many people claim, as the idea of “virtual reality game meets anime” has been done before (shows like .hack and Accel World). But, some of the scenery and animation is done beautifully.
Though the animation lacks at times, it can also be quite good. Some of the boss fights and action scenes were animated well with a good variety of bright flashing colors emitted by the skills and magic spells. Also, the bosses designs were pretty epic and the usage of CGI made them really pop out. The soundtrack was decent, though not very memorable, while the openings were very well done.",3

                This is my first review so if I mess anything up I apologize.
When the series first started I thought it was going to be great because it had such a strong start and great first few episodes, but that sadly wasn't the case. I ended up getting so angry with the way the story was developing halfway through that i actually stopped watching it for a while. I had no intention of picking it up again, but so many people were talking about it that I decided to watch it again in hopes of it getting better. I thought it was going to be centered
                  on the fact that they're trapped in a game and fighting so they can make it out alive, but it turned out to center more on the teenage romance between the two main characters, Asuna and Kirito. It also had a lot of side stories that didn't contribute to the main story whatsoever. And it didn't really focus on the main plot. As a gamer, I really was interested in the idea of the gaming system and the virtual world and all the fighting scenes made me really want to play it. I think I like this anime because I love the idea of the game, the plot, and the virtual world, not the actual anime itself. I loved the idea of it more than the actual anime itself. 
Story (5/10)
As I said previously, I thought that this anime had a strong start. The first couple of episodes had me thinking the anime was going to go in a completely different direction then it actually went. As the story went on, it just got worse and worse and made me more and more disappointed. The story felt very dragged out and at times forced and generic. What really makes me angry about this anime is that it had great potential to be turned into something amazing and the first couple episodes lived up to the expectations. The story starts out as everybody being hyped up about the new game Sword Art Online and when they first enter the game it's as great as everybody thought it was going to be, but then the creator comes and tells them that if they die in the game they die in real life and that they need to clear all the floors in order to get out of the game. That right there, could have made an excellent story line, but instead it focuses more on the romance between the two main characters and has a bunch of side stories that don't contribute to the main story whatsoever. The romance in it also felt awkward and forced at times. It was like a teenager had written it and that's what they thought love was like. Then on top of all that, Kirito becomes a typical ""chick magnet awesome"" character and every girl he comes across falls in love with him. All of the characters also can do nothing without the main character because it's one of those stories. Then as it goes on, the story obviously favors Kirito and makes a bunch of things that are supposed to be impossible happen for him so that he can win. Again, so generic I could vomit. I could go on and on, but the main point it that it was disappointing. 
Art (8/10)
I thought that the art was fantastic. Probably the best thing about this anime. The way the characters were drawn was great and the fighting scenes were absolutely gorgeous. The animation was in no way disappointing. The hair wasn't one of those ""how does their hair defy gravity like that?"" it was pretty tame compared to a lot of anime hair. The outfits were also very nice. So basically, I liked the art the best.
Character (3/10)
The character development was awful in this story. It was generic, it didn't go into depth, and like with many other things in this anime, I was disappointed. Asuna, the main girl in this story started out as this awesome mysterious character that knows how to fight and ends up a ""I can't do anything without my boyfriend around"" character. She cries a lot, she seems incapable of doing anything without her boyfriend and it's ridiculous. I was looking forward to a cool female character that could actually fight, but no. Then with the main male character, Kirito, he had potential, but turned into a generic male lead. He became the strongest character that had a bunch of things helping him that were supposed to be impossible and had every girl he meets fall in love with him. Words of the day: disappointing and generic.
Overall (7/10)",7

                By the time I am writing this review, people are probably already discussing the first episode of Sword Art Online II and I still haven't watched it because, in order to write this, I had the brilliant idea of rewatching SAO in order to make sure that my fuzzy memory and bias for this anime wouldn't get in the way of judging it fairly.
One of the main reasons I feel the need to write the review is because I see a lot of fanboys praising it to oblivion alongside a lot of people who have this incredibly big hate boner for SAO, but I never
                  see that much of the guys in the middle of all of this, guys like me.
With all that said, I guess it's time I move on to the actual review
Sword Art Online (Or SAO for short) was this incredibly popular anime back in 2012. Like, really, really popular. Heck, all of my otaku friends were watching it, it was the shit back then, an anime about a MMORPG? Back then, this was a new thing for us. There was the .hack series, but other than a few series like that, this wasn't a setting that was explored that often in anime. Now, looking back at these past years, it seems that this kind of setting has become very popular due to the hype SAO had back then. Yeah... the hype.
I'll be blunt right away: This show was overhyped. A lot of people, including it myself, were calling it one of the best series ever, something that, looking back it now, SAO isn't even close of being.
Animation and sound wise, it's pretty good. The art style used in this anime is incredibly colorful and captivating which is only further improved by an amazing soundtrack that knows when to stand out and when to blend with the atmosphere. I think that it's pretty safe to say that this is the best part of SAO. Sadly, the story ain't it...
This story has received a lot of criticism for the past few years and, for the most part, it is correct. The main problem with the story comes from the characters themselves and the way they are portrayed. You have Kirito who is your typical shonen protagonist, except that this one is incredibly overpowered to the point of making many Mary Sues out there hide in fear. Yes, he is a really big Mary Sue, he is the kind of guy who has no problem facing most enemies and quickly solves the situation with one lazy swing from his sword. Not only that, he is also that ""swaggy"" character who gets all the ladies, and that doesn't help him becoming less of a Mary Sue at all....
His personality is ok, even if he needed maybe a tiny bit more of humor to balance out his serious attitude. However, on the scale of shonen protagonists, he's not that different from what we've seen personality-wise, so it's not a really big issue.
The other main character is a girl called Asuna, who Kirito met inside SAO and has teamed up with. In the first few episodes, Asuna is a bit of a badass character, but then her Tsundere senses activate and she quickly becomes a pretty girl who falls in love with the main protagonist. Look, I don't have a problem with she being total Tsundere, I don't have a problem with the romantic subplot (for the most part), I just have a problem how sudden this transformation felt. One second she is kicking ass and the next she is cooking a fucking meal... and trust me, she doesn't get better later on.
Overall, I found the characters in SAO to be poorly written for the most part, which is definitely the worst part about the story and can be a pretty big joykiller for some. However, the characters are the only part about the story that I would consider a joykiller because I found the rest of the story to be fairly decent.
At the end of the day, I don't hate SAO despite my big problem with the characters because, despite all the harsh criticism, I look back at it and find myself to be entertained by it, which at the end of the day is all that matters, and I ask myself why, why did I enjoy this if it had such a big problem?
The answer lies in the other side of the story, which is the story itself .
SAO is the story of a few people trapped inside a MMORPG that they must beat in order to leave. It's a fairly promising premise that always left me hyped for the next episode. I strongly believe that, despite the bad characters, the writing did a fantastic job in capturing the essence of a MMORPG. Stuff like the quests, PVP, crafting, raids, guilds... all those little elements that pretty much became a staple of the genre are there and they are portrayed in a pretty accurate way for the most part. I have been an avid MMORPG player ever since I was 11, so I know how those work and the way it was portrayed in SAO at first made me feel right at home. The story at first had a structure in which Kirito goes on multiple adventures, meeting a lot of people, which for some felt like filler, but for me was perfectly fine because those who have played MMORPGs will know that this is how they work, a lot of them don't have a scripted way of going through the game, you just explore the world and participate in any quests and events you find along the way in order to grind XP and level up (World of Warcraft, Guild Wars...), and since their goal was simply ""beating the game"", I don't see any problem with the story structure being about Kirito travelling to random places and doing things that are completely unrelated to most of what previously happened. Besides, it actually contributes towards world-building, a really good thing to do in a MMORPG setting since the worlds in those games are so big that the players are always tempted to explore them and see all there is to see.
That said, I can only say this about the first story arc that takes place inside SAO, after that we have yet another story arc taking place inside another MMORPG which is complete and utter shit.
In this second arc, all the mechanics that make up a MMORPG are completely thrown out of the window and they are instead replaced by a boring story about Kirito going from point A to point B in order to rescue Asuna. Yeah, you heard me, she is no longer a badass, now she is a bloody damsel in distress. Not to mention that Kirito remains completely Mary Sue in this arc, maybe even more taking in mind that his swag increases alongside the amount of fanservice (Though I will admit that there was one fight that actually didn't make him look like a Mary Sue since the opponent actually felt worth the time)
In the end, I don't think that SAO is a masterpiece nor do I think that it's utter garbage. It has a lot of problems, but it's still a fairly enjoyable series that is worth at least giving a try if you are interested in the MMORPG setting. Other than the characters, the second story arc is also a big issue, I can safely say that if the anime was just about what happens in SAO, the score I would be giving to it would be much higher, but since I have to take in mind all of it, my overall score from a more analytical point of view is a 6/10",6

                Sword Art Online is a phenomenon. Personal opinion aside, Sword Art Online's status as an iconic anime in the anime industry is an undeniable fact. Why is this? Is it due to the outstanding story Sword Art Offers? Rather, have you ever met an anime fan who has not at least heard of this stigma? The success of Sword Art Online and how known it is actually goes deeper than quality or how well the story was executed, the stigma itself rose to new heights due to the demand for video game type of plots and the conflicting entities that surround this work. 
Join Kirito,
                  Asuna and company in a journey in the dangerous RPG  known as Sword Art Online. Grab a few potions, and happy sailing. This is, Sword Art Online:
Before I get into the review I really should come out and admit my opinion on this piece of work before getting ahead of myself. I truly did not hate Sword Art Online. I thought the series itself was nowhere near the level of hate it often receives from an almost cringe worthy fanbase. While I cannot deny Sword Art Online's execution and story was not amazing and it really didn't offer anything great that other anime have offered better, though the remarks calling it the worst anime ever are unbelievably not accurate. Rather, if this is the worst anime ever created then anime's position as a medium is really secure. On the flip side, Sword Art Online was not a masterpiece. Actually, I'd say it did more wrong than it actually did right. The story of entering a video game and being in danger of death or injury is NOT original nor unique. Though, I feel like out of all the titles I've seen of a person or persons getting trapped in virtual reality, Sword Art Online's success may just be the highest on the totem pole. Meet Kirigaya Kazuto, or Kirito. Kirito is a fourteen year old who considers himself a solo player meaning he usually doesn't join guilds or participate with other players. Though, that does change as the season goes on. Upon meeting a colorful cast and Asuna, Kirito joins the fight and tries to survive this deadly game. Can the love between Kirito and Asuna blossom into something great? Will the two survive the deadly RPG? If you have the HP to find out, give the series a shot.
This is where Sword Art Online shined for me. The soundtrack of Sword Art Online was able to assist me chugging through some poorly executed episodes that I felt could of been executed better with more effort brought forth. While not every episode was bad, some of them only shined with the soundtrack presented or the characters that surround this franchise. Plus, the opening of Sword Art Online is truly amazing. It gets you pumped, wanting more. You begin getting the song in your head hoping it won't be forgotten quickly. If anything, Sword Art Online's soundtrack deserves some praise. It was in fact, good.
While not all were great, the characters in Sword Art Online were fine. Kirito was not an amazing main lead, though he gets the job done when you look at what this series presents itself as. Asuna started off really great, though I felt like she lost a lot of spark when she began to depend on Kirito and his assistance like we've seen in other anime. Personally, Rika shined the most. I felt like her character was the best Sword Art Online offered, though characters comes down to personal opinion and how you feel for the character. I wouldn't be shocked if you loved every character that surrounds this stigma, though disliking every character is also not a void opinion.
Did I enjoy Sword Art Online? Well, yes and no. I'm in the minority, but the second arc for me saved Sword Art Online because I felt due to how it was handled, plot holes were far less existent and Suguha was my second favorite character of the anime. I was less bored of the anime overall when it hit that point, though the first arc's final episodes were pretty fun. I'd say overall, Sword Art Online's enjoyment was a 6/10. Not great or really all that good, but a fair rating for an anime that was enjoyable when it was good, but ugly when it wasn't doing well.
Should you watch this? Well, yes. I'd say watch it for the experience and the easy to approach story. It isn't great, but it was a pretty interesting idea that may of been executed better if handled differently. If you do watch it, try not to be sucked in and get addicted, you may just end up like Kirito.",6

                First off: this review contains a few SPOILERS in a later part, as it is not completely possible for me to discuss some of the series' shortcomings without going into a bit of detail.
SAO seems to have divided viewers like only few others I've seen, as the huge gap in rating and review scores suggests. However, I would strongly advice people to keep an eye on the score numbers in other reviews. For me, this series was kind of disappointing despite its enormous popularity, even though I liked many other popular series of past years. A lot of potential, but also a lot of things
                  wrong with it.
The first parts will deal with the individual ratings while the more troubling things and inconsistencies that prevented a higher rating will be adressed in the ""Enjoyment"" section.
Story: 7
The general idea of the setting is quite fresh to me. People are getting trapped in an MMORPG with the actual problem of dying in real life if their HP reach 0. They are only able to get back, if they manage to beat the game, which reminds you of the classical ""Lord of the Flies"" setting, but with a nicely cooperative twist to it. A really good and promising premise that could lead to quite a complicated plot, many ethical dilemmas and difficult social relations due to the game mechanics. However, many elements, like the heavy amount of romance and slice-of-life parts kind of prevent further depth of the story. There are some episodic events that tackle the things the characters have to deal with, but in general, the great potential of the setting is not fully explored. Especially, since the notion of dying in real life is nullified around half of the series. There is an ingame revival item, but it gets left behind along the way, though there are some very good points where usage would've made sense.
Basically, the first half (SAO) is superior to the second (ALO) in pretty much every aspect (characters/world design/setting/pacing). Drawing out the SAO part to 25 eps would probably have improved my rating by 1 or even 2 points. ALO as a whole feels less than necessary and it wouldn't have hurt to just call it quits after 14 eps.
Art: 8
Quite satifying. Things like backgrounds and the general animation quality and fluency (with some episodes stepping it up a notch during fights) are definitely likeable. The fighting scenes are mostly done well, but again, those in the first part seem just a little better to me with a few exceptions.
Sound: 7
As with the art, this one scores quite well. Sound effects, BGM and opening/ending are executed in a nice fashion and something to remember. Not much to complain about here.
Character: 4
Lot of improvements to be done in this category. The main character, Kirito, does not seem to have any shortcomings at all, winning every battle, making all the girls fall in love with him (including family mebmbers, that's right) and generally succeeding in everything, despite ever seeming exceptionally clever, charming, tough, whatever you need to achieve those things. The most promiment character trait are his moral standards, which develop a bit during the first episodes and then stay at maximum level for the rest of the series. Asuna and Suguha, the other main characters, could also profit from additional development, which gets overshadowed by terrible fanservice and lots of overexcessive emotions. Many of the interesting or possibly important side characters, like Klein, only appear on very irregular timeframes, their development is left behind as well. The portrayal of the main villians is especially bad, which will be discussed in the next part.
Enjoyment: 5
Like mentioned in the story part, a lot of things are done not quite as well in the second major arc (ALO), and I asked myself alot what the developers were thinking in handling it like this. There is so much potential for the premise and some of the characters, that disappointment is petty much bound to happen, especially if you have watched some series that managed to handle it all well. There's also a ton of details and inconsistencies (some of which may be nitpicky) I would like to address:
- Technology issues: aside from some problems with the game mechanics and the characters behaviour due to it (which have been discussed by a lot of other reviewers already), I have a problem with the NerveGear hardware and the general situation in the world. First off, the ability to intercept and alter all of your brain signals without any physical contact to your CNS in a small, battery assisted helmet is ridiculously far ahead of current technology and science. It's not something we would get in about 10 years and it's also not something that would be released to the common public just like that. The technology needed would pretty much cost a fortune, which leads to the assumption that Kirito must be filthy rich. The safety of the system is incomparably poor and you would never get a life-and-death setting like that in real life due to heavy testing and control. There would also be no way players would lie around in the hospital for years without anyone trying to hack into the system or finding a way to forcefully remove the NerveGear and destroying its battery.
- Medical issues: as a biology student, I cannot help but notice those. For some reason, it seems that NerveGear users have a near perfect control of their bladder and can go on for very long times without taking a break. Also, the hospital that harbors Kirito is something you do not want to get into. For a kind of comatose person, he received pretty awful care. Not even a feeding tube, which means he should have starved to death. It also seems that nobody cares about the heart rate monitor being removed. Aside from his SAO char, his real body seems indestructible as well, as he can just walk down the hallway after 2 years of coma, all through willpower, which leads me to the next point.
- The concept of willpower: there are some situations in real life where willpower and tenacity can help you achieve your goal, but also some where it is fruitless and stupid to go on. Some anime manage to implement this quite well, but in SAO it's very blunt. Willpower (and also the power of love) makes you defeat every boss, gives you constant plot armor, lets you overcome the game's very code and makes you walk first try after your muscles had no exercise for 2 years.
- Villians: this is something really messed up. In the series, the second antagonist (Sugou) is portrayed in a much more (awfully stereotypical) evil and crazy way, even though the first one (Kayaba) has caused exponentionally more harm. It's pretty safe to say that Kayaba is a psychopathic mass murderer with a god complex, being directly responsible for the death of ~4000 people. Even though, he kind of turns into a good guy in the second part, which is utterly ridiculous in my opinion. There is no proper redemption if you have killed that many people who didn't deserve it just for your own selfish reasons and no writer should protray it like that.
- Other: I'm just giving a few keywords for these things, some which this series (and pretty much every anime on this planet) wouldn't have needed. 
Fanservice, harem, Gary Stu, plot armor, deus ex machina, (hinted) incest, (hinted) tentacles, inhuman emotion levels, oceans of tears, endless promises of love.
In conclusion, not everything is bad about this series, but I have no idea how it has gotten to it's incredibly popular state, as it does not deserve it in terms of quality. However, if you are watching for the action and fighting scenes, you will most likely not be disappointed.",6

                My feelings on Sword Art Online are rather . . . odd.  When I first began to watch it, I fell completely in love with everything; I found it very surreal, which is one of my favorite things ever.  But then I began to watch Gun Gale Online and began to slowly lose interest, so I stopped watching and began to really think about it.  After which I sat and watched Digibro's hour long ""diatrabe"" on it and that kind of sealed the deal.
This. Show. Is. Terrible.
Completely, utterly, dreadful.  Riddled with plot holes and contrivances of every color.
If you're looking for
                  something that you can sit down and watch and not look very deep into and base your enjoyment purely off of what you feel, or if you're a 12-year-old-boy, then this show is fine.  But in all other ways . . . oh my.
I'm not even going to get into everything; there's far too much.  
Kirito has literally no characterization whatsoever, aside for the PTSD guiltyness or whatever.  Asuna has one of the best character designs I've ever seen, and everything is actually quite well animatied--though I have seen some evidence of a drop in funding or something--and I suppose some things can be interesting and I did feel emotional when the show wanted me to, but now that I've thought about it, I am actually infuriated that Sword Art Online managed to dupe me so thouroughly.
Things that happen with Asuna get to a level of just pure offensivness more than once, the ENTIRE SECOND HALF of the show is just one giant contrivance where the author just wanted something dramatic to happen and just . . . guh.  Stop watching it, guys, it's an insult to your intelligence.",3

                Hello again everyone and welcome to my review of the praised and hyped anime: Sword Art Online.
Please note that this review might contain spoilers and will probably have some. Also note that his is my personal review on this anime and should not be taken as professional in any sense at all. I’ll try to keep it objective while adding my own tinge of subjectivity to it. Please enjoy.
Sword Art Online or SAO for short is what I'll be reviewing this time: An anime that was hyped to hell and then thrown to the ground after episode 16; An anime with many pros and many,
                  many cons. I'll be frank, when I finished it I fanboyed it to high hell and back, I even went to the point of asspulling arguments in order to make it look better but as I compared to my favorite anime of all time, another action-fantasy anime by the name of Shakugan no Shana and as I compared it to many other animes of slightly different genres but, nonetheless, action animes I found many flaws. Now, with that out of the way, let's crack down the trainwreck into tiny pieces and put it back together after.
Let's start with the story:
The story is something that will attract many gamers such as me. The first VRMMORPG(Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) ever created just came out from beta and the day of launch is upon the many people of japan(because apparently only japan can create such wondrous feats and play them) and people race to their local stores just to find out the beta assholes that pre-ordered it already emptied the shelves. We are then introduced to our main character Kazuto Kirigaya more popularly known as Kirito. Kirito was a beta tester of this new VMMO… GAME which is called Sword Art Online and so he already apparently has a copy of the game, has installed it and just about everything else even though the game was released just a few hours before. The story is mainly set inside this virtual reality as players find themselves suddenly trapped in a world they don’t know, they aren’t familiar with and doing things they’ve never done before. The creator of the game also made it so that if they died, they died everywhere, game and real life. And so the anime presses on with a focus on the repercussions that such a decision brough- who am I kidding. The story turns into a classic harem story with a focus on the main character’s endeavor to find emotions on his otherwise bland personality as he, alone, is able to defeat 25 man-raids, 5 man dungeons and achieve one of the highest levels of the game… Even though the game is clearly designed for people to work in groups. He also manages to break the rules of the game due to “HUMAN WILL” since games are not made with codes and so on which can’t be altered unless you have access to the game’s console and what not… But apparently if you wish for it hard enough or believe in the fairy magic of love, you can bend a computer game to your will!
I COULD forgive the bland approach to such a nice setting if they just managed to do the rest right… But they didn’t, instead the story plummeted into such a deep shit that you can’t distinguish what is the anime and what is the pile of humongous, smelly feces.
The characters:
First we have Kazuto or Kirito. A gamer for life which apparently has no social life apart from his pseudo-sister which is actually his cousin which isn’t actually his cousin or maybe is since I don’t even know after all that went on between them. Kirito is the embodiment of all gamer related stereotypes from the dull eyes to the zero social life and the full dedication to games. He’s also bland in personality and shows little to no emotions apart from his irrational love for his dear Asuna which provokes on him extreme anger at the most appropriate of times and… Not much else apart from a few episodes in which he actually gets sad because people died.
Asuna is by far my favorite character, too bad they had to ruin her with the typical harem crap of not developing her. She has by far the most vivid and real personality, the most interesting and actually the only bearable story and she is the only female that doesn’t disappear forever after one or two episodes.
Then we have the character I hate the most. Suruga, which is Kirito’s pseudo-sister or cousin or whatever. She is… Dreadful. She’s just there for the silly harem love triangle and she has almost absolutely no depth. Her reasons for pseudo-incest are laughable at best and her whole character is just dreadful. She deserves every little once of hate I have for her and if you don’t hate her than you should reconsider everything that you know about her. She has no depth, no development, she’s there for a simple love-triangle so all the fanboys can fawn over Asuna while feeling sorry for Suruga when she, in fact, deserves nothing but hatred because of just how shallow her character is.
All the rest are just plot-moving characters and non-developed characters that demonstrate little to no development or depth.
The music and the animation:
I could go on a rant forever about these but I’ll sum them up really quickly for you. They are absolutely amazing. If there’s anything that makes this anime worth watching it is clearly the art and music.
With my review concluded I end with saying that this show… This show is really enjoyable for the first 16 episodes. I’d give it a 7.3 if it ended on the 16th episode but it didn’t and so, considering the stupidity of the ALFheim story arc I’ll give it a certain score I’ll say in a bit.
So with that said here are my scores:
Story:  3/10(Good setting ruined by harem focus)
Characters:  1/10(Childish, bland, love triangle)
Animation: 10/10(Superb)
Sound: 10/10(Superb)
Enjoyment: 8/10(It will be very enjoyable at first, including the second half, but once your turn on your brain and examine what you just saw and experienced, everything above will plummet on you and make you feel bad for enjoying yourself like you did)
My overall rating is of a 6/10 with a recommendation to watch it up to the 16th episode and then NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN!",6

                I for one don't write reviews, but for the sake of future references, my thoughts would give some consideration before watching this Anime. Also NO SPOILERS throughout this review to those who still want to watch, but there are 2 Story Arcs.
Sword Art Online is centers a Boy named Kazuto  Kirigaya, whom is attached to video games, more specifically it's own genre ""Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game"" (VRMMORPG). With a game system called the ""NerveGear"" that is placed on the player's head, they can enter a virtual reality game, in this case for Kazuto, ""Sword Art Online"". He then roams around with
                  the screen name ""Kirito"". One day he met the player by the name of ""Klein"", whom needed help how to play the game. Kirito taught Klein with the fighting techniques he knew himself and was time consuming. They're both tired and wanted to log out, but couldn't do so because they have been called to the ""Main Lobby"" (assuming with video game logic) for a message from the admins. The admins announce that they trapped all of the players inside the game and cannot log out, the only way to do so again is if to beat 100 floors of the game's map. HOWEVER if the player dies in the game, they die in the realworld, with the NerveGear that can fry their brains (I could be wrong, but I didn't really pay attention to that). And thus forth, Kirito must try to beat all the floors with help along the way including his Female companion, Asuna Yuuki. To not only get himself out, but other players as well. 
Now personally I don't really have a problem with the Anime, in fact, I read the manga for a little bit before the announcement of the Anime, but I feel turned off while watching was the characters. Kirito himself is too overpowered, he may be lower levels than the actual players, but he SOMEHOW just beat everything, whether he knew the boss already or just flat out pulled a ""Cloud Strife"" moment. It's the same senario again with the first half considering he's always with a girl on a quest and saves her like it's a Princess thing. There's nothing wrong with that, but that's too much in the long run.
Now another thing I wanted to point out was what turned me off while watching this was the FANCLUB OF THIS ANIME IS SO DAMN CRAZY. Literally when I keep hearing things related this Anime, it's just non-stop ""Kirito Harem King"" or ""Kirito, Legendary Gamer"" or even ""Kirito, the Strongest Fighter"", SERIOUSLY? Kirito shouldn't even have those titles, in fact, the only thing he obtained was Asuna's Love (In real life). Harem Kings will always be a debate, but I think it would be Touma Kamijou (A Certain Magical Index) or Keima Katsuragi (The World God only Knows). ""Legendary Gamer""? I want to refer back to Keima again. ""Strongest Fighter?"" In real life he was beat by his sister in Kendo, even if he has his powers from the game, it's still not stronger than most fighters. Even Krillin (Dragon Ball) can beat Kirito.
Though this itself sounds like a rant, I'll credit to where it's due. The story is based like a Romantic Shounen, but it has plot twists, so it's kept interesting instead of just a flat out ""Oh look, the main enemy in plain sight"". Also though all girls love Kirito like a Harem, Kirito actually picks a girl to be with, unlike most Harems. The art is vivid and soundtrack is enjoyable. 
Overall, it's enjoyable, but when I was watching it, you'd be annoyed the hell out of like I have, so if anyone reads this who seen the Anime with my opinion, I'm not too far off with this right? Who ever doesn't and religiously follows it like most other people, then I feel sorry, that's just it. Who is hesitant of watching this Anime, I'd say......at least you won't be annoyed the hell out of when you're watching this in your time.",7

                STORY:
To tell you the truth the story of this Anime is somewhat similar to the "".Hack//"" series but this is not necessarily a bad thing.  10,000 players log on to play in a new virtual immersion MMO called ""Sword art Online"" after being lucky enough to snag a copy.  Once there they find that the system has been locked and the only way to get out and back to the real world is to beat all 100 floors of the game and death is 100% real. Kirito who was one of the Beta players helps the group fight the first boss and meets
                  Asuna while doing it.  Because the beta players are being blamed for the deaths of rookies(by not providing enough info) he intentionally makes himself an outsider.  He still manages to help people along the way but becomes known as ""the black swordsman"" and the ultimate solo player.  All this takes place inside the game but it would have been nice to see a couple of news reports form outside like the light novels had.
Characters: 
 Kirito, Asuna and their friends are neat so far but it seems that all the girls he meets seem to fall for him including a blacksmith named Lizbeth and a cute beast tamer named Ayano.  There's also a group of PKs who actually murder people within the game to provide more conflict at times.  Also some characters may not be what they seem and hopefully more will come of this as the plot advances.
Art:
The vr world that everyone is trapped in is pretty epic and the times that we sometimes see monsters are pretty well drawn.  The locations can be graveyards, dark dungeons, towns and open fields...all are pretty well depicted.
Overall:
If you looking for something fun to watch you can't really go wrong here.  I've had some spoilers on the novels so if they keep to that plot there shouldn't be any issues. I was pretty unsure at first but it seems to be coming along nicely.",8
"
                Sooo, I finished the entire Series in less than 24 hours. Let's see.
Animation & Artwork: 9.5 / 10
I'll make it short. There isn't much left to improve. The only thing that keeps me from rating it 10 out of 10 are the facial expressions which are sometimes overdone (especially regarding Sugou). Also some action scenes tend to be blurry and the characters in these scenes seem to be offmodel. This occurs especially in ALO. Other than that... great characterdesign, backgrounds that can be described as ""Scenery Porn"" without exaggeration and overall animations were probably among the best ones I've seen yet. Currently, Sword Art Online
                  ranks second amongst the most beautiful Anime I've seen yet, after Fate/Zero and ahead of HenNeko.
Characters: 8/10
Depending on the Situation, Asuna can be pretty moe (I see now why she won the SaiMoe Ruby Necklace). She's a good cook, is gently and due to character design even for anime standards dang beautiful. Oh, did I mention she's the Vice-Commander of the best guild, learns extremely fast and has the fastest attack speed of each known characters? She's dang Badass Adorable.
Hmmm... I'm not sure if you can see Kirito as a normal Shounen-Protagonist due to the not-that-standard Setting, compared to let's say, Naruto, Bleach or Fairy Tail. Whatever. His main drive in the story is to clear the game as soon as possible. Due to unfortunate events, he get's quite bitter  until he meets Asuna and snaps out of it. His and Asuna's interactions with each other and especially with Yui are really cute, I for one got a warm and fuzzy feeling each tim they were together. Furthermore, he's also an generally nice guy. And so by the way he is the only SAO-Player with Dual Wield, kicks even boss-asses and tends to go berserk. He's a Badass Bloodknight.
Hell, even the Sidecharacters have their moments of awesome and badassery.
The only characters I really didn't like one bit were the antagonists of the arcs. I despise the first antagonist for forcing the players to participate in a massacre for his own amusement. And Sugou, the Antagonist of ALO, is such a douchebag that you have the urgent drive to ram your fist in his face everytime he pops up on the screen.
The show get's carried by Kirito and Asuna, and they do a dang good job at it.
Sound: 9/10
Hmmm, the Openings and Endings were quite good. The Japanese dub was excellent. For a change of things compared to other Shounen-Anime, I didn't have the urge to facepalm and ask myself ""Really, dou you have to scream that much?"". The reason this rating is so high is due to the BGM which can be described as epic. It doesn't matter what the situation at hand is, the OST fit's to a T. And SAO makes you know when it want's to be awesome, cause the OST does help a LOT. (Especially in Scenes where Kirito uses his Dual Wield, the combination of that and the music will result in much awesomeness).
Story & Storytelling 7/10
For me, the whole ""get-sucked-in-a-game-and-survive"" Setting is new. I haven't seen Series like .Hack or Accel World yet. Due to that fact, the Idea was interesting - a normal game becomes a Deathmatch that only ends if the big bad is slain and each lost life on that mission is an absolute death. Personally that's quite the harsh tone for a Shounen. ALO though has a quite weak story - the hero must save his princess, that's all. 
For reference I read the Light Novels volumes one to four. The Adaption of the books was quite good though not perfekt. I personally didn't really like these Timeskips, they made it quite impossible to have a smooth flow.
ALO... Well, it was a weak arc in the LN as well frankly spoken. The antagonist was an even worse arsehole in the Anime than in the Novel, the Story wasn't quite as deep as the first arc's one, I didn't like the Idea with these fairies (Why fairies of all things? Why not Half-Dragons or something that's awesome?) and it became quite boring towards the end.
At least I often cracked a smile when the awesome scenes occured or when Kirito and Asuna were together, they are a perfect match.
Enjoyment: 8/10
If you take the whole series, the enjoyment would be a straight 8 out of 10. SAO alone would be a 8.5 out of 10 while ALO would just be a 6.5 out of 10. SAO was diverting, exciting, I liked the characters, it was occassionally funny - simply spoken very entertaining through and through.
ALO though... less. Like I already said, why in the name of god did the author decide to make badasses into fairies... Else, the several already mentioned deficits. Opening and Ending were not as good as the first one. Suguha was sometimes pretty annoying with her BroCon. But Sugou takes the crown. I've rarely seen such an absolute douchebag in an anime - I literally cheered When Kirino defeated him - mind you, it was three a.m.. The main issue with ALO though was that Asuna didn't get the chance to do any fighting whatsoever. 
Rewatch: 7/10
It's quite the high rating. It doesn't matter that the end is already known since, despite all the seriousness of the story and the rather realistic problems of the characters, it's a shounen after all. What makes a rewatch enjoyable as well is the great chemistry between Asuna and Kirito - for me, they are in the same league as Yuuta x Rikka (OTP from Chuuni), Yoto x Tsukiko (OTP from HenNeko) or Ruri x Kyousuke (Favo-Pairing from OreImo). Maybe they even reach in the realm of Ryuuji x Taiga, whom I consider to be the best couple in the history of anime. Another reason to rewatch SAO are the astonishing good action scenes in the first arc. 
Rating for both arcs: 8 outta 10
==========================================
Woah, kinda positive surprise there. If ALO didn't have the mentioned Problems, maybe SAO could've got a straight 9 outta ten. I really apologize to SAO and it's fans due to the fact that I mocked them and branded SAO as overrated crap. It was after just getting myself to read the novels that I grew interested in it.",8
"
                You know, I really liked this at first. I was looking at it from a gaming point of view, thinking about how cool it would be if this was real.
But that didn't last very long. I soon realized how ridiculous the whole thing was - from Kirito being the most unbelievable character on Earth, to every single bit of fanservice sprinkled across this thing.
I recommend you watch it, just to get where I'm coming from. Everything LOOKS amazing, everything SOUNDS amazing, and even the STORY is amazing. But if you get caught up in all of those details, you're going to miss out on what's
                  actually happening. Kirito is constantly having these weird mood-swings and he goes from being as edgy as a scrapyard after a bombing, to being sensitive and emotionally perfect.
The only weakness the main character has is physical - his stats. But he's always doing the right thing, he always understands what's going on, and it just doesn't make sense. Even his stats don't make sense, as a solo player would NEVER be able to get that much better than everyone else. There's just no way. 
Positive aspects:
1. Good plot - the plot itself is very well done, if a bit impractical.
2. Good art - they only use CGI once, and that's kind of impressive to me.
3. Good sound design - the intros are great, and the voices are well done as well.
Negative aspects:
1. Plot holes - the ending has so many plot holes I nearly mistook it for a cheese wedge. 
2. Fanservice - while it serves its purpose, the amount of it is simply astounding. It's really not necessary, and it's sort of demeaning after a while. Do we all just look like giant penises to the creators of the show?
3. The second arc - it was horrendous. I liked the first arc, but the second one was just plain weird. Plus, it didn't make sense for the programmers do even allow everything that happened, to happen. They have full control, and yet they never use it!
In short, this is gamer bait. It was at least mediocre while it lasted, but the undying love and support of the fans was simply unwarranted.

                I'll keep it Simple & Clean: This Anime was a wasted potential monster.
(Synopsis)
This Shounen started with a typical Fantasy-Adventure setup but lost itself somewhere along the line and became a Romance-Drama. That said, this Anime is distinctly divided into 2 completely different story arcs.  The first arc focuses on surviving the *very real* death threat to all players trapped within the virtual reality game ""Sword Art Online"" whilst exploring the effects of that on the human psyches trapped within.  The 2nd arc travels to a completely different game called ""Aeroheim"" with *no real* looming threat to anyone, insignificant new characters, and controversial themes
                  of incest & sexual assault.  I loath the 2nd arc;  and I mean that in the WORST way possible.  I don't understand how the writer's focus shifted so drastically.
There are some good things to be said about this show, but virtually all of them stem from the first arc.  Personally, I would have just ignored SAO after episode 1 and labeled it a "".Hack"" reiteration not worth my time... if episode 2 hadn't introduced a unique story telling element; time skips.  The characters are forced to live in game on real world time but the story skips over their day to day ""XP grinds"" to focus on the story.  While this hurried the story along, it also cut out all unimportant things and gave all characters a sense of mystery; a curiosity into what has been shaping the people they are growing into.  Sadly, it's short-lived and only last until the show begins shifting to the Romance-Drama motif around episode 9.  I also praise the shows attempt to investigate the frailties of the mind when dealing with what is essentially a virtual prison.  This is a more mature theme that gave the show a range that let me get excited for future episodes.  But sadly, it too was weeded out by the end of arc 1.  So much wasted potential.
Next to the uneven story telling, the character development is this Anime's greatest downfall.  Interesting characters are introduced and never given due time to shine while the 2 main characters either don't grow or grow in ways that hurt their character.  The protagonist really doesn't evolve beyond the ""Knight in Shining Armor"" archetype and the love interest goes from being a timid mouse with potential, to a 2nd in command badass, and then devolves to a whiney, crying ""Damsel in Distress.""
Ultimately, I really liked this anime's first arc and it would get a much higher grade if it ended there.  But the tragedy that is the 2nd arc just holds it back so much.",6
"
                They gave the show a proper ending approximately halfway through the first season and then, for some unimaginable reason ... kept going. 
To be honest I perfectly enjoyed the first arc of the series. While not particularly original in terms of characters or story, it had enough entertaining elements to keep my attention. I would not call it a work of art nor a masterpiece, but it was engaging and fun. Naturally there are a few issues: the pacing seemed a bit poor, the end conflict with the antagonist was abrupt and anti-climactic, and in the pilot episode they seem to intend to make Kirito's
                  'beater' persona a much more central plot/character aspect but this too sort of ... fizzles. But the action and humour is amusing, the vision of the world of Aincrad is captivating, and the animation is crisp and attractive.
Let's be real: the characters are kind of flat. Asuna seems to exist solely for the purpose of being the cool, pretty, talented female (who is naturally good at cooking) in order for the hero to ""get the girl."" Kirito is sorely lacking personality, but in defense of this, there is a reason why this model works: a bland protagonist who is ""the best and most talented and most special"" makes it easier for the audience to project themselves onto the character. However, despite how two-dimensional the characters are, the relationship between Asuna and Kirito is fresh and charming. (Until it is later done disservice by apparently obligatory harem antics.)
I would have been content if they had ended SAO after the Aincrad arc. After that, the show loses a lot of its integrity. New worlds and antagonists are introduced, none as interesting as the original. The sense of urgency and tension is gone from the show after the characters escape SAO, giving it the impression of simply having a very, very long and poorly planned epilogue.",6

                This review may contain spoilers
Harem Online,I mean Sword art online is an anime aired in 2012 based on a light novel series of the same name by Reki Kawahara (he also write the novels of Accel World) and it gained a lot of fans and popularity.
Well, with that introduction let’s start this review
Story:2
The story of SAOis divided into 2 arcs and it follows the serie of events after the release of a VMMORPG called Sword art online,on the day of its release,when everyone is online, the game creator Kayaba Akihiko says that they can't logout until they clear the 100 floor and if they die
                  on the game,they will die on real life.
The premise is very good,the idea of virtual reality game is very attactive and the death game makes it interesting,not new or orginal but interesting.
Although,a good premise means nothing if the story develops bad and SAO suffers of that.
The anime starts really well,with the first episodes focusing on the story,but then it follows everything except the main plot,making the protagonist fishing,playing the ""happy family"" with his virtual girlfriend,helping helpless lolis with his dragon or being CSI Online.
The anime spends a lot time and money in things taht can be told on 5 minutes or aren't needed,the improvement in the game is ignored making time jumps like it was Steins;Gate.
The story of SAO is full of clichés and predictable things,and even at some points it's embarrasing,well I mean if the goal is to clear the floors,why you would care if any one ""cheats"" to clear and even more,when you fight for your life?
Moreover,the main character's plot armor can be shown in 2 galaxies away,making him wining everyone alone,and yes,he was a beta tester but I don't think a beta tester can won a bunch  of guys by staying in frontof them.
The romance is a very important aspect of the show,because it aims the events of mostly of all the story.
The romance in this anime doesn't work at all,it seems to be written by a someone that has no clue that how they work,the interacctions between them are boring and dull,the couple has not chemistry at all,the characters aren't fun and they romance is forced as fuck.They instert a lot of stuff to make it seem like an adult romance and it's kind of ridiculous.
Despite this,the first arc of SAO is fun to watch.It's stupid but fun to watch but the worst it's about to come.
The second arc make it worse,all the problems with the first arc increase in such a way that it seems like they were insulting me.
There's a forced love triaingle between a ""sister"" who is not a sister,oh Japan...,a girl in coma and a teen.
The princess that has to be rescued,the villian that doesn't deserve such a title,more fanservice and cliches and archeothypes,making Mario Bros look like a fucking masterpiece.
The second arc of SAO is more embarassing than when you're watching a film with your parents and 2 characters kiss.
So,the premise is great,the rest is complete shit.
Art &Animation:8
The animation was made by A-1 Pictures known of other anime like Ano Hana,Black Butler,Fairy Tail or Your Lie in April and it's great,the battles are well animated and the background is flawless and the ilumination of those backgrounds are very well done.
The battles can be animated or can be a powerpoint,showing you,frames whare the characters are jitting but not any actual movement at all.
The character design is standard but it's well done,even though,in the second arc is changed into something infrerior with those awful elf ears.
Sound:8
The OST was composed by Yuki Kajiura,known of other OST's like Madoka Magica or Fate/Zero and it's amazing,it's a plus to almost every battle and with the animation make it the only good aspects of the show.
This show has 2 Ops and ED,in the first set,OP is good and the 1 ED is meh and on the second one,OP is forgettable and the ED is okay.
The voice acting is solid and the sound effects are okay.
Characters:1
The characters are poorly written clichés
The main characters:
Kirito:The protagonist,everything and everyone is about him.It's also known as Gary Stu and it's portrait as a God,showing contradictions and flaws of everything his personality supposes to be.He's a character where everyone can insert,so it's the son of every beta character ever and a Gary Stu.His our lord and savior Kirito and that's not me,is how the show presents it.He's a self-inserted character that you're supposed to insert in and be amazed about his awesomeness and root for him,because ir's a light novel,of course and all girls fall for him because he's amazing and he's the MC.
Asuna:Co-protagonist,at first is shown as a badass player but then she turn into a generic tsundere who is usless without Kirito.In the second arc she became a damsel in distress been  raped by a evil butterfly dude trashing all her image of been a strong female character who kicks ass,been unable to do anything and waiting for Kirito to recue her.
Sugu:Incest.She's the little sister who is not the sister because Japan always looks of excuses to hide incest who's as interesting as a wall and it's useless without Kirito.She's only a pair of brests with no brains and only as another fetish on the harem.
Klein:the main character's friend archetype.To be honest,he would be a better protagonist than kirito as he's more likeable and no perfect hero that everyone loves.
Lisbeth:another girl in the Harem,,she's a blacksmith and she is introduced in a couple of episodes to be kick to Kirito's harem,falling for him for no given reason than his the main character of course.
Silica:talking loli.She's nothing but another girl added to the harem,introduced in one episode in one of the most insulting way imaginable,she's been attacked by a tentacle moster,making more deviant and a step away for a hentai.The only thing you can say about her is that she likes Kirito and has a little dragon.
The villans:
Kayaba:He's the main antagonist in the first arc who's motivations are never explained in one of the worst attempt to create a moraly grey character with one of the most embarassing monologs about how he wainted to bulit a castle when he was young.At first,he seem as a great mystery,a mastermind,but in the end his motivations to kill millions of people are never explain and he remiains a psycho killer with no motivations.
Suogu:The main antagonist on the second arc is a fucking butterfly that doesn't even desrve that title,he's bad like he was one of evil guy of Disney,in fact,they're far better written and characterised that this thing.He's a rapist evil butterfly dude,oh the depth.
Enjoyment:5
Despite of all stupidness,I have fun watching it but I would't recommend this thing to anyone.
Overall:4
SAO is not the masterpiece that someones claim to be,it's not as bad as some claim to be but itr's bad.
Itr's a better overrated show,itr's doesn't mean that you can like it or enjoy it,I fact I had fun watching it.
It's not like the concept it's new or the romance is the best.
For another animes to see,I recommend to check out
-Eden of the east-very original death game and far better romance
-Log Horizon-More technical about gaming things for all MMORPG fans out there.
So,that's all folks.",2
"
                    Sword Art Online or SAO for short. One of those animes that split the community in half just by talking about it. I find SAO one of my favorite animes, why that's my opinion and nobodies here to read about my opinion ~pff~. And yes, this review won't be on my opinion but what I actually think about the show's execution. Even though it's one of my favorites, I can't say it had the best story and characters, and if I did that I would just be flat out lying. Honestly, no one can say this anime was a masterpiece, but
                  you can say it was your favorite anime.
    SAO takes place in the year 2023-2025 if I'm not mistaken. A game that requires a helmet called the Nerve Gear to transfer your mind into a VRMMOPRG (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). Through this, we find our protagonist, Kazuto Kirigaya, or in the world of RPGs ""Kirito"". The same SAO has been released, Kirito goes into the world of Aincrad. ""A floating castle"" that has 100 floors. On this day about 10,000 people were online and as these 10,000 people play some have noticed that the ""Log Off"" button has disappeared, vanished. All these 10,000 people are now forced teleported into the ""Towns of Beginning"" where the GM (Game Master) appeared explaining what has happened. Paraphrasing what the the GM said, SAO now is a survival game. A virtual game with twist, ""If you die in the game, you die in real life"". As pandemonium breaks loose the GM gives them all one last present, a mirror. A mirror that will make your RPG avatar turn into what you look like. Now to beat the game and release everyone, all you need to do is beat all 100 floors.
  While I know this story wasn't original, the thing that got me was the twist. A virtual reality...that isn't your real life but if die you're real body dies too. What SAO did quite well was there first few episodes. Showing us viewers how this twist works. Though, as you continue to watch, they don't show the audience this twist quite as much as you would like to see. But in exchange for some well done animated fight scenes. Another good thing about the anime is that the art is well done. Very detailed and great lighting. The boss fights or fights in general, were flashy and a good eye candy. The rest of the story gets choppy. What I mean is that the story has a ""stop, sprint, stop, run, walk, stop, run, sprint"" type speed or the pacing was bad. One day, Kirito is 14 the next 16. There is a big time lapse that really bugs the hell out of me.
 Another huge down side to SAO is the characters. The character had no, and I mean no character development. The characters usually pop up once and then you don't see them again until the end of the series, honestly. The only characters that you see time and time again are Kirito and a the heroine of the story ""Asuna Yuuki"" and a little bit of Kirito's friend ""Klien"". All of these character that get the most screen time don't get a back story. NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Though what makes up for this (at least to me) is the the romance that surrounds Kirito and Asuna. But you get all that in the second half of the anime and the ending of the first half. I'm not really going to stress on that but Kirito's cousin ""Suguha Kirigaya"" is introduced. She is another character that gets a lot of screening time and just like a gram of character development. The characters overall weren't that great, they honestly weren't that good either. Some of them were boring others were annoying, and some were pretty cool (just Klein). Another bad part about the characters were the supporting cast or the people that showed up once in an episode and never appears again. These characters were honestly useless. Each one caused problems for Kirito and in the end Kirito turns a blind eye and some how becomes friends with them or they start feeling ""emotions"" towards him. But once they do that, they never appear as a big role in the anime again. Which is a shame since this is a 25 episode anime and could have done it easily.
 While the story and character weren't good I adored the art and sound. I have touched on the art already in the third paragraph and will say, again, that it is eye candy. The slashes, bashes, stokes, fighting were done clean and smooth. As the OST goes, it was eargasm. At first, the first opening sounded like something you would just skip, but as you keep listening and listening to the melody of the song, it gets stuck in your head and later you put it on your playlist and listen to it once you go to bed...The first ED was grand: Soft toned and relaxing. The soundtrack playing while fighting was unique...But if you already watched it, rehear what the soundtrack was playing when they fought a boss or something. ""Coffee, soda, coffee, soda, give me coffee"" is what I keep hearing...I don't dislike it but sometimes it takes the seriousness out of the action scenes.
 The reason why I enjoyed this and it became one of my favorites is because...well I don't actually know. Well kinda. I love the idea of saving your loved one, being trapped in a different world where you need survive, the idea of a survival game. But it also turns you down on how it's executed. Poor and hard to follow. I can see why people hate this anime. But I also can see why people love this anime. It might not be the same reason I liked it, but at least we have something in common. And for the people who hate it, I don't blame you, but please don't try to force it down our throats that you hate it. SAO is poorly executed anime, that is indeed true but with this poorly executed anime you get a lot of enjoyment and possibly some inspiration of love or something like that.
Would I recommended SAO, only if you like to have a good time and watch some awesome romance and action scenes but if you watch anime for actual plot done right, you're going to have a bad time.",7

                Everything went downhill after they ""beat"" the game.
The pros until that point:
Animation: I don't think anyone can really say a bad thing about this aspect, since it is honestly pretty damn great.
Romance: Most anime never move past the awkward interactions between the two main characters, but this one definitely does. It was beyond gratifying seeing the male and female main characters actually fucking get together, and was made even more so because each one was a badass. The girl didn't depend on the guy, and the guy didn't objectify the girl. A HUGE breath of fresh air.
The world: The set up is simple: You lose,
                  you die. To win get to level/floor 100 and beat it. This allowed for the focus to be less about setting up the world and more about just exploring it, and given the stellar animation, this was thoroughly enjoyable. Especially since most anime viewers are also gamers and would love the chance to explore their favourite games (Skyrim for example.)
Death: It had gravity here, and you could see it weighing on the characters with each friend they saw die or each foe they were forced to kill. 
Cons until that point:
Harem: This was mostly forgivable as it was relatively minimal, and the romance between the main characters was fleshed out to the point that most of the harem girls allowed themselves to be okay with being friends with Kirito.
Time Skips: I honestly would have been perfectly happy if a few seasons had been dedicated to exploring the world and going from boss to boss. This is probably my biggest gripe, as it feels like a hugely missed opportunity.
Minor subjective complaints here or there: These were minor personal things that I found to be either a bit irritating or would have preferred removed, but otherwise don't really impact my final thoughts in a noticeable way.
Now... AFTER they ""beat"" the game....
Pros:
The animation: This is honestly all I have. It was another well-animated world, but I felt cheated out of the one we had gotten used to and didn't have much a chance to explore this new one. 
The CONS:
Story: It became a ""rescue the princess from the rapist bad guy"" trope. In the first game they had a very real, concrete threat: dying. They didn't really NEED a villain, and that was part of the beauty and charm of it. There is literally nothing unique or engaging about the rapist/elf-lord in the second world.  Such a waste of potential, and a downward dive into a pile of shit.
Characters: Harem was kicked up ten notches and even includes Kirito's ""sister."" I believe they're technically cousins, but were raised and thought of eachother as brother and sister. Fucking really? And of COURSE they unknowingly spend time together in the game and she falls in love with him AGAIN without realizing it. This was such a waste of time for me.
The main gripe though is of course Asuna and Kirito. They had blossomed into such a wonderful thing that I couldn't believe the degree in which they were shat on. They were two strong, independent people and they actually were in a pretty adorable, sometimes moving relationship. Can't have that. Let's lock her in a cage with a rapist and make her super tough god-like boyfriend rescue her.I don't know how anyone thought that was a good idea.
Final thoughts: They went from a world of possibilities and a wonderful relationship in anime to a very very very typical story beat of ""rescuing the kidnapped and helpless woman."" They went from an interesting world to one moving too fast for me to bother caring, especially since there was no reason for me to care. Dying in the game meant literally nothing, whereas before it held so much weight in the show. If the show had ended after they beat the game, I'd have been a little disappointed it didn't have more of what I loved so much, but it also wouldn't have rolled around in dog shit. I'd have given it an eight or nine simply because I enjoyed how refreshing it was. But then it well into old anime habits and I stopped caring. 
My advice: Pretend the show ended when they ""beat"" the first game world. Ignore the rest of season one, and don't bother with season two.",5
"
                Numerous people in the anime community have tried to paint the image that Sword Art Onlineis a bad anime. I can tell you that this in fact couldn't be further from the truth. Sword Art is not bad, it's mediocre, which is much worse than being bad. I won't go on a rant about the second half of the show and how it ruined the whole series partially because its been done a thousand times before, but mostly because I don't necessarily think that's even true to begin with. The main problem with SOA is not the second arc, it's something that started way before
                  the series even reached that point.  What ultimately got Sword Art Online from a great concept it was in to the mediocrity that it would eventually turned out to be in the end was like so many other anime before it: the characters.
Now I'm not judging people for liking Sword Art Online. If anything I'm jealous that they managed to enjoy something I didn't. It's no set answer for what is good and what is bad and what it ultimately all boils down to is whether or not something managed to speak to you personally and in the end that's all you should really care about.  For me though  Sword Art Online just felt like a lot of lazy writing.
We got Kazuto, a self professed nerd who spends his days in the virtual reality world of SAO, which eventually turns out to be a death game meant to trap everyone who enters it until they can beat all 100 levels of the game. Teaming up and befriending a small guild who all ends up dying the emotionally scared Kazuto swears that he will never join a group again and decides to beat the whole game as a solo player. That's until he meets the breasty kick ass, heroin and part time chef  Asusa. Second in command of the biggest, most respected guild in SAO, and someone Kazuto ends up falling deeply in love with. Sounds great so far. Except in reality it kinda isn't. Every character including the protagonist Kazuto is completely bland and without any real personality. A fact that becomes even more apparent once the show gets  to what eventually is the focal point of the whole series. The relationship between Kazuto and Asusa.
Even though they have only known each other for about 2 scenes and haven't really been talking to each other that much we are suppose to buy the fact that these two love birds are deeply deeply in love. Of course Kazuto asks Asusa to marry him, which is a bit of a gamble so right after their first kiss and to something too which she probably ought to reply: ""Wait a minute? Didn't we have our first kiss about 2 seconds ago? And on our last date the two of us were even too embarrassed to even be able to look at each other half nude and now  you want us to get married? Don't you think we should at least spend a little bit of time getting to know eachother and perhaps see if this relationship thing works out first? How old did you say you were? What was your name again?"" But luckily she's all down for it,  and now 3 days later they they're living happily in a cabin by a lake with their AI daughter. It's amazing the things that can be achieved with the power of love.
Oh Asusa. Remember the good old days when you were second in command of the largest most powerful guild in the world and you were out there kicking ass and taking names and didn't take crap from anyone? Now you're married to a guy you have been knowing for about a week and suddenly you're a housewife who's only job is making food, standing around looking cute and from time to time be caged up by the ocational villain waiting for your man to come and save you before the villain decides to rape you. I'd say: You would give the feminists poster materials for months. 
Have you ever noticed how whenever a girl in anime chooses a boy to be with their life is basically over and they're just reduced to being a common housewife incapable of making their own decisions regardless of their previous engagements? Asusa didn't. But maybe in time when looking back on her life she will. And she'll wonder what would have happened if she didn't meet Kazuto and continued to be the strong independent person she used to be.
But then again, perhaps Asusa really lucked out on this one seeing that Kazuto apparently can't come in the proximity of 15 meters of a girl without her falling in love with him. Which is strange because he is basically just a shut-in cardboard cut-out anime hero stereotype with not really much personality to speak of. But the girls don't really have much of a personality either so I guess it works out. Kazuto why does girls keep falling in love with you? What do you have that I don't? Perhaps I'll just have to face the fact that this greased up otaku who can't say anything but clishés and thinks walking around in a black coat looking moody is cool, is just much more of a man than I am.
What really makes a man a man is a question I think about a lot. And sometimes in an attempt to find the answer I will do as my Viking forefathers and take my clothes on and head out to the wilderness in order to find a polar bear to wrestle with. Out there I will prowl the Norwegian tundra, silent, yet deadly, as I make my way across the icy landscape until suddenly! Emerging from the cold morning mist a large white figure, tall as two horses and with the muscles of an ox. I'll lie in hiding as the figure makes its way past me, waiting for the proper moment. And when it finally comes I'll stand up and shout from the top of my lungs ""Hey, you! Yes you Bear! Fuck you!"" The bear will turn around looking at me, first confused, then annoyed, and shouts back at me ""What? Fuck me? No, Fuck you! You humans always coming around here whith your quests of self discovery. Always looking for a fight. I'm just an ordinary bear minding my own business, trying to make a living in this cold  hostile world and now I have to put up with this constant harassment on top of it."" Feeling a bit guilty over the awkward situation I shout back at him ""Oh, sorry. I guess I didn't mean anything by it. It's just my sister Sara who keeps questioning me about why I'm not more of a man and then I though I might go out here to try to find the answer."" ""Is your sister Sara?"" the bear asks  surprised. ""yeah, do you know her?"" ""Well I guess wouldn't say I really say I know her. We were in a brief relationship back in high school, but we broke up the same year because she would always force these pseudo philosophical arguments that never really got anywhere and I haven't really talked with her since."" ""Yeah, she can be like that Sara. Takes some getting used to, but at the bottom she's a really nice girl."" Well, nothing to be done then I suppose. Well I better be on my way. Starting my shift down at the old paper clip plant in about 20 minutes and don't want to be late."" ""Alright, have a good one!"" And then the bear wanders off inn to the mist and I stand there looking after him. Feeling the rising sun on my back, reflecting over the events that transpired. Him, a unionized working class polar bear, me a squanty editor for a production company making serialized documentaries. Our lives as different as it comes, separated by a path layed out by nature through thousands of generations, impossible for us to understand each others way of life. And I  return home, confident in my new view on the world.
I guess I went on a bit of a tangent there, but the point is that the characters in Sword Art Online are very bland and not very well developed. They don't have many character traits to speak of and often just does whatever the story requires them to do as opposed to doing what their personality would dictate that they'd do. There's a trick you can use to try to decipher how much of a personality a character has in fictional works. Try to describe the character without talking about: what they look like, what their role in the story is, what they do and what happens to them. The more you can say, the better the character. For example Michiko from Michiko & Hatchin  is arogant, overly self confident, impulsive, not very bright but has a lot of street smarts and prone to sudden burst of violence if she gets anoyed. But she's a good person at the bottom even though she doesn't want to admit it. I was trying to make a similar list for Kazuto, but I honestly can't really come up with a lot to say about him. I guess he doesn't like being in groups. But even that is questionable seeing how easily he is willing to forfeit that principles given the opportunity. It seems that when they were constructing the story, thinking about all the cool scenes they would have, all the hearthquenching romance that would be inn it, all the cool stuff the characters would do, they failed to ask them self the important question of who these characters were to begin with and why they were doing the things they were doing. Apart from pure physical attraction what is it exactly that Asusa and Kazuto love so much about each other? Why are they willing to potentially forfeit their real lives so they can live in this virtual reality together? And the answer is that they don't really have a reason, because neither of them  really have much of a personality in which they could get those reasons from. Of course this isn't just SAO problem. Lots of anime have this problem. But it doesn't excuse the fact that SAO has these issues and the whole show ends up feeling exstremely underwhelming because of this.",4

                Here comes my first review, oh, how dreadful. Why would i review this masterpiece so late? Because reasons.

Sword Art Online; SAO
An anime that unfold the story of a teenager.
Who is hella-good at game. In this case, MMORPG
That one year has changed the living-way of gaming.
For better or worse. Virtual reality has became a thing.
There's that one dude: In Kirigaya Kazuto - We came.
The avid-gamer that do bloody good work at every goddamn thing, including gaming.
Ok, this premise is boring, just start the review already!
Story: 2/10
Sword Art Online:
""Why two out of ten? This is a masterpiece! Yes, masterpiece-ofbullshit-! It's not that bad, no not that BAD. So, why two then? because reasons.
SAO tells the story of our unfortunate protagonist, Kirigaya Kazuto. Yep, from his fame he should be that whiny-little-gay-bitch-nerd-shutin-socially-awkward-kind-of-guy. But no, in the world of games, he trust. What the hell, that doesn't make any sense!? Of course not! it's the reminiscence of the story, it doesn't make any goddamn sense in any goddamn context.
The story is your typical teenager boy who is always goddamn whining about what the goddamn hell is wrong with the ""real"" world. He wants to goddamn live inside the game world, which he is more goddamn comfortable with. He escapes to the world of Sword Art Online, a hyped MMORPG, just like this goddamn anime... but then the game turn out to be a goddamn survival game, with fridge-horror logic like when your in-game avatar die, you goddamn die, in real world, forever and goddamn ever because frying brain is just like frying fries. This Kirito now wishes he didn't play the goddamn game, alas he was too late. However, his wish is granted, his former certainly is... but then he goddamn whines, he wants to get to real world, again, with a certain girlfriend, and a guy, and another guy, and an AI, all of the girls, harem indeed. Goddamn goddamn goddamn Goddamn Goddamn GODDAMN Goddamn goddamn! goddam! What the goddamn hell you want to bring your goddamn bride out the goddamn survival goddamn game, you wants to survive, then stop the goddamn thing like love is a program! Straight to the end of SAO Arc is a POWER OF LOVE, ASUNA! Yellow eyes! Hiyaaaaah! Then the big-bad dies, the end!
No! there's another arc but it's shitty as hell. Now the boob... i mean Kirigaya Suguha is... yada yada... another game called ALO. Now, i would wish the big-bad's ""i am god"" plan success. But it's not. Because the anime would be adult-only from the mind to the rape. Imagine, those girls... those goddamn girls. Alright, now it's not the power of a program, but the bid-bad from SAO Arc is back, alive and kicking. The it turns out, he is just a program, goddamn hell. Then, he gave Kirito GM's right, which is essentially cheating. Nice job breaking it, ""hero""-kun.""
""Then..."", grandfather said.
""Grandpa, please stahp."", as his grandchild goes to sleep, forever because the story. Ha ha.
Art: 9/10
Sword ART Online. Yeah. Very good job. Special mention to the special effects. Now that's what you call ""Effect"" it really affect the atmosphere and tension at fight, and only at FIGHT.
Sound: 7/10
Well, nice. But almost no RPG-ish. It's more like... Good
Character: 1/10
Character is simply flawless!
And Kirigaya Kazuto aka Kirito is, of course BADASS. His character is very interesting; funny, bubbly, innovative, smart, badass, cool, manly, social, cool, funny, unique, and almost perfect. And Asuna also interesting, beautiful, moe, perfect wife. Oh, and Sachi, poor Sachi. And Silica, moe, cute, loli, imouto, And Lisbeth, genki, tsundere, fluffy. And Klein, manly, funny. And Boobs!I mean Sugu, boobs, boobs, boobs. And Yui, cheating device. And Kayaba, smart, wise, the-one-who-never-forget-his-reasons. And Sugou, smart, manipulative. And that Skull Reaper before the final battle in SAO Arc, its character is well-developed; he has scythe and skull, and centipede like, and can one-hit kill many twats. BADASS
Ok, i'm high.
Enjoyment: 3/10
The whole episode make me high. In fact i'm writing this while i''m high.
Overall: (2+9+7+1+3+4):5= 4
This anime just got his ass-saved by the consistent art and decent sound.
The Closing:
No hard feelings, fanboy and fangirl. The concept are decent. In the end, the decent part is overshadowed by the most shallow part ever in MMORPG history:
""No girl would just threw her heart for something that doesn't make any sense.""
Wat. This is so goddamn wrong on so many level, this review included.",4
"
                Here’s a review that will probably never be read; there are already tons of reviews crafted with flaming eloquence up there and the show has already been aired for a long time, however, dear Reader, if you are here, I thank you for the consideration of my humble opinion (also valid for SAO II).
If SAO was a trap, I fell into it. 
It is a euphemism to say that this anime has issues. I won’t be long summarizing them, since there is a lot of good and sincere reviews on this site (if you manage to dig them amongst pure hate and overly passionate fan
                  base). The story has huge plot-holes, the pacing is weird, the fan service insulting, the characters are a bunch of stereotypes (with special mention to Gary Stu The Dual Wielding Black Swordsman And Jedi Jesus-kun, Harem King Of The Rejected Women's Club And Master Of Glopping (read in a youtube comment)); it’s rushed, pathetic and disrespectful. 
And yet, I enjoyed the series. A lot. 
It is a truly paradoxical sentiment as I could remark most of the issues while watching it; reading the reviews made me feel a bit guilty of the enjoyment experienced. Each episode had its loads of facepalming (incest one-sided relation=facepalm; every girl falling instantly in love with Kirito=facepalm; Yui=facepalm; and so on), and still, I went throughout the two seasons.
It is hard to say if it is the most awesome dumb thing or the dumbest awesome thing. However, note that the show manages somehow, in the midst of awesome and bullsh***, to point out some really interesting reflections on virtual reality.  
As it has been said, the packaging is flawless; the anime looks and sounds good. Better, the animation is great and beautiful, and the OST is amazing. The show kind of works on effects rather than substance, and it’s a pity. 
So, here are my recommendations:
1) Be prepared to be disappointed because after the the two magnificent first episodes, the show wastes his golden potential.
2) Enjoy the first story arc (ep. 1-14), because it gets worse after that. It is a waste of wasted potential. 
3) Enjoy the whole two seasons, and don’t care if people want to judge you.
Finally, above all, if like me you couldn’t conciliate your reason and your enjoyment, or if you ""meh"" the series, go watch the abridged version of SAO by Something Witty Entertainment on Youtube (or Facebook). It is truly hilarious; the characters are much more accurate (special mention to smartass Kirito). And what I didn’t think was possible in this kind of parody, they achieve real character development and even touching moments.",7

                **Warning: Possible Minor Spoilers**
The idea of a Virtual Reality MMO is actually quite plausible.  The idea of this Anime is pretty unique.  It doesn't deserve the hate that it gets, but it's not the perfect anime either.  Here is my review of Sword Art Online.
Story:
Ok, most Animes usually last around 12 episodes for a short 1 season story, or 24 for a 2 season or longer story.  So initially, as I watched the first few episodes and got the grasp of the purpose of the anime, I thought, ""yeah, I can see this taking 24 episodes"", and having the final episode
                  for an ""epilogue"" type episode.  But knowing how a plot works (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution), you can kind of feel when a story is about to end, and sadly, when I felt the climax kick in, I was a little disappointed and hopeful that it would pick back up, because it was around the 6th or 7th episode when I felt the story coming to an end.  It was around the 13th episode that initial goal was reached, but then another problem kicks in, and the initial environment changed.  Not gonna want to spoil too much in case you haven't seen it, but if an Anime is gonna be called ""Sword Art Online"", and the point of it is about a game called ""Sword Art Online"", you would think it would stay true to the title, instead of jumping around, or at least change the name to ""VRMMO"".  Initially, on KissAnime, I saw SAO, and SAO2, so there being 2 seasons, and being at the 3rd episode, my mind was ""ok, this will take a while.  You gotta grind in MMO's, you gotta complete Quests in MMO's, 2 seasons seem reasonable"".  What I'm saying is the Story was great...but for it's concept, it felt too rushed and the second season felt unneeded.  A better story would be having the first half, the first season, and stretching that portion out to show us more character development and hardships faced.  Then have it end on a cliff hanger when Kirito finds out...the thing that sets up for the second half (don't want to spoil it.  If you watched it, you know what I'm talking about.), and then have the second season replaced by the second half.  Other than that, great concept, fair execution.  So for Story: 6/10
Art:
The art from the Light novels/Manga and the art from the Anime, are vastly different.  The Characters look more clean and crisp in Anime form, than in the Manga and LN.  The Art is exceptional, and knowing the Studio behind this Anime, it's not hard to see why.  A-1 Pictures picked up this anime, the same Studios behind other remarkable Anime such as Anohana, Your Lie in April, IDOLM@STER, Seven Deadly Sins, OreImo, and Fairy Tail.  The animation rarely has any faults in it, and unlike the more mainstream Studios like Toei and Pierrot, A-1 rarely uses still images, repetitive scenes, and doesn't heavily rely on second layer animation, thus giving SAO and all it's other Anime a more lively and fluid feel to it.  But SAO, unlike Fairy Tail or it's Brothers from the same Studio, has a Video Game feel to it, and uses CGI to create a Video Game feel when it comes to Particles, and the HUD.  The fights are well choreographed and well animated.  If you hate the art, you're either blind, or lying to yourself.  So Art gets a 9/10
Sound:
Not gonna lie, Music-wise, it sounded exceptional.  It was placed in situations where it was called for, and it fit in really well.  Was it good enough for me to buy the OST?  No...except for the Openings and Endings.  But Sound doesn't come from the OST alone, what about the SFX?  Every Sword clashes, swings and stabs sounded great and had great quality.  None of the sounds were repetitive and cheesy, like what you hear in DBZ and other Action Anime (you know the sounds I'm talking about), and the volume control was done great.  The Voices, overlapped the Music and SFX, but not to the point where it went to loud to be audible.  Speaking of Voices, I have great ears, don't mean to brag.  And it irritates me when an Anime's voices sounds like it was done in a fanmade fashion.  Like it was recorded in a closet or room, and you could hear buzzing coming from it that cuts off when the voice's file ends for that scene.  The voices not only sounded great, but they fit in with the characters, which I'll talk about in the next topic, so for Sound: 8/10.
Characters:
Want your characters to be rememberable, either make them do something we will never forget,  put them in an anime we will never forget, or give them a unique name so we might never forget.  Luckily for us, SAO does some of that.  Most Shounen Anime should give their characters unique names so we never forget them, once we know who it belongs to.  DBZ has Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, and Kururin.  One Piece has Luffy, Nami, Chopper, and Zoro.  Although SAO has names that aren't as unique, they aren't names you hear often in other animes, and that's what makes them stand out.  You ask somebody ""what do you think of Goku?"", they say ""strong"".  ""what do you think of Luffy"", ""Stretchy"".  You see the pattern here?  Everybody that has seen DBZ or OP, know the names Goku and Luffy, and what they relate to.  Everybody that has seen SAO know who Kirito and Asuna are, even though Kirito isn't his real name.  Although there are some characters who break that rule like Yui, which is a pretty common name, especially for characters in a HighSchool Anime that features a Light Music Club (K-On, TWGOK, etc.), and you can even say Asuna kind of breaks that rule to, just because of Azuna from K-On, but I'll let it slide because they might be spelled the same to us, but in Japanese, that one consonant makes a huge difference in spelling...kind of.  Moving on!
Starting out, when I first saw the characters, they looked nothing like the Cover, and I was like ""don't pull a DBZ on us and change the character's looks and designs halfway through"", but then as I finished the episode I realized how it worked.  But even if the Character Designs were or weren't changed, they're in a video game and they can be changed, as you will see if you continue on to the second half, and more-so in the second season.  The Main Characters had their recommended amount of screen time, and it was nothing to complain about.  What about the Side Characters?  You bet I forgot completely about them.  They were rarely ever seen, except for the Kirito's first partner, who shows up here and there, just enough for a side character.  But there is a girl who falls for Kirito, who I'm pretty sure only shows up for one episode until after the season is over, this big buff guy who shows up to explain mysteries or just to help the characters out in general.  They meet people along the way, but ultimately they get forgotten (except for Kirito's first group because plot needs us to be reminded of them).  But when we encounter a side character with some significance to the main characters or plot, they have some development, even if it's just for one episode.  The only Side Character that I actually fell in love with is this one girl that Kirito and Asuna meet.  Her origins are a mystery at first, and she's the only character with somewhat of a backstory.  This is around the time where Kirito and Asuna are ""married"" and this girl refers to them as ""mama"" and ""papa"".  Not surprisingly, this is the only girl Kirito encounters that doesn't actually fall in love with him as...that.  But sadly because of reasons (don't want to spoil too much), she dies, but leaves a memento for Kirito and Asuna.  Luckily she's brought back for the second half, for reasons I forgot, but HEY!!!  The girl you cried for is back.  And she's more cute than before, so that's a plus.  By the second half, she isn't really counted as a side character anymore. But ultimately,  you see the main character and how they interact with each other, and the situation they're in.  At first they panic in this world they're stuck in, but then, they get used to it and think of it as the real world, until they're reminded it's not.  There are sad moments, but there it has no backstory to each character...unless you count for Kirito's ""sister"" and characters in the second season, but really, everyone in SAO are just regular people who happened to pick up a game and got trapped inside.  Backstory wouldn't really be needed or wanted here.  This makes villains and there motives kind of...bland.  But Kirito explains that in games, there are people who just go around and randomly kill people for fun, and this being done to me in many MMO games, it makes sense.  I mean they're in a game, you expect them to have some kind of vendetta on a person or something?  The concept is virtual reality, and you are how you are in the real world, in this game world; Aside from some KOS players of course.  A plus is this Anime has a romance, and it picks up pretty early in the series, but unlike those romance anime where once they start dating, they get all shy in front of each other and don't know how to act, the romance in here is an actual romance.  They would die for each other, fight for each other, and love each other.  They aren't shy, and you can tell when they start ""living with each other"" and ""get married"".  Eventually they escape the virtual world, no big spoiler there, and even in the real world, there relationship stays true and the same, this is better seen as you understand the conflict in the second half of the anime.  So Characters, if they gave the Side Characters more screen time and significance, it would be perfect, but because they didn't, 8/10
Final Verdict.
Sword Art Online.  Great concept, but rushed story.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Action Anime.  This Anime is similar to Fairy Tail, as in it gets un-deserved hate because of it's hype.  If people say they hate SAO, it's probably because of SAO2, or the pacing.  The Anime itself is alright, although the LN is significantly better.  If you like Video Games, Action, Adventure, and Romance, Watch SAO...and then probably watch SAO2...I...meh.
SAO: 8/10",8

                Hello, this is my second review. Hopefully I do better. This review is off my first anime I ever watched, It kind of got me into anime really. I enjoyed it well, thought to review it, some aspects need work.
Scores-
Story: 8-The storyline was pretty good. Honestly, it starts to follow a normal storyline of an average action anime. But, later, the story develops and becomes more complex in different ways. It's an interesting storyline. It could be cleaned up a little though.
Art: 6-The artwork was fair. Is kind of average drawings. Minus the boss battles and important scenes and events, most times the artwork lacked
                  a bit. The background characters didn't move regardless of sound, scene, etc. The main characters were the only ones really detailed, sometimes not fully. When at distances, they lacked detail.
Sound: 9-The music within the anime really fixed the context and content. The music followed the scenes and fit very well. I enjoyed the music a lot, I even tried learning them on guitar. They did well with the music.
Character: 6-Character development was alright. Really more focused around the main character(s) rather than side characters. Most characters were introduced and didn't change. Many of them were static characters. Otherwise, the more main and important characters were somewhat dynamic. But overall, character development was fair.
Enjoyment: 8-I enjoyed this anime a lot because it was my first anime. I didn't expect to enjoy it, but it kind of got me into anime more. This is a very good anime to start with.
Overall: 7-Again, averaged scores, but overall a 7. There are issues that could be cleaned up, but it is a good anime to start off with. This is still opinion though.
Thank You for reading, I hope this was helpful. I tried not to be too biased but I did my best in reviewing this. It was a little bit of opinion but that's really what reviews are.

                Ahhh~ Sword Art Online, often dubbed as ""one of the best animes in the industry"" supported by it's colossal-like fanbase. 
But is it really though? Have we properly given the series a unbiased review? Does this series truly deserve the accolades that the community bestowed?
Short Answer: No, it doesn't.  
Story - (2)
The story goes as short: ""Kazuto Kirigaya is one of the few lucky individuals that were able to play the brand new MMORPGVR (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game Virtual Reality) Sword Art Online, and was transported into the fantasy virtual world that is Aincrad, until suddenly it is revealed that the game
                  creator has trapped the players in the game by stripping them of logging out and disabling respawns. Players who's health points drop to zero will meet death both in the game and in reality. Despite the grim turn of events, there is all but one hope of escaping this virtual prison... clearing all 100 floors of Aincrad. Now it's up to Kirito and his allies to work together, fight, and survive through this virtual hell... where now any mistakes he may make will be his last""
Sounds good on paper doesn't it? ""An exciting, sweat-breaking adventure of survival full of action and people pushed to both their physical and physiological lim-""
No... it's anything BUT that. 
This is one of the main problems that exist within this show... its that the major theme of the story isn't focused on at all. The first two episodes are arguably the best. It clearly depicts the struggle the players are going through, not just with escaping, but also tensions against other players who were beta-testers or player-killers, then ending it with an exciting boss fight.
That's as good as it gets. From here, it only goes downhill... with unexplained time skips, filler episodes, introduction of pointless side characters, and harem building. The show itself simply becomes an absolute waste of time where now watching is incredibly tedious, something an anime should NEVER DO. Seriously? How do you mess that up? How do you strafe so far from your original concept, that mind you was the primary advertisement for it to have it change genres from a supposed ""action-adventure"" to a less than mediocre harem? The anime does a better job showcasing how many girls Kirito can get rather than telling us how everyone else is busy dying! Don't believe me? Let me show you: The anime does a massive time skip where suddenly thousands of players die. No montage or flashback... just a split second of dialogue to show recognition. Then we have six whole episodes just on Kirito building his harem. Even when you reach the ""plot"" episodes at the end, the conclusion makes no sense at all, where EVENT A happens because of UNEXPLAINED LOGIC? What makes this so bad is that viewer isn't at the slightest rewarded for watching the entirety of the first arc, but simply leaving it off a rushed and terrible ending. Making your whole experience seem like a waste of time. 
There's a second arc, but don't get your hopes up. Its unsurprisingly worse than the first arc. Set in a different game world (because after going through a near-death experience, might as well experience again right?)
except now instead of being captives in a game world, Kirito is off to save his love interest/waifu/one of the many members of his harem, Asuna. The classic ""Hero must save the princess locked away in a tower"" cliche.  But just like its predecessor, it just mainly consists of filler-episodes and harem building... and then suddenly incestuous themes? ""Way to break the mold."" 
Anyways, the entirety of the arc is a chore to watch with practically no points in which its enjoyable. Not to mention, the ending is also like the first, where nonsensical conclusion is due to unexplained logic. 
Art - (7)
The art is amazing, simple as that. The colorization of the characters and the scenery does help create a believable virtual fantasy world environment. It's very fitting and hardly anything to complain about. 
Sound - (8)
Personally, my favorite thing about this anime.  It's just absolutely astounding due to its ability to further your immersion into this fantasy world. Not to mention, one of the best openings themes I've ever heard. Being both visually appealing and memorable, however; credit for that primarily goes to the vocalist LiSA.
Characters - (1)
Kirigaya (Kirito) Kazuto - 
A character who is so perfect... it's annoying.  The epitome of a Gary-Stu, with things such as a surprisingly deep knowledge over everything, being a favorite to both women and men, attracting a large array of waifus, and being so overpowered that he breaks the game. Single-handily defeating a raid boss. Remember in MMO, its expected to bring hundreds of skilled players to defeat these bosses, but by having a single player defeat these monstrosities shows on how pointless this endeavor is since there is somebody who is virtually unbeatable. A struggle between life or death is void since the main character is basically immortal. Not to mention, his personality uninspiring and bland
Yukki Asuna -
I honestly had hopes for this character, at the begin.. she starts off as a strong female leader willing to do anything to survive. As you would expect due to the circumstances she faces. Sadly enough, she is one of the biggest slap in the face you'll ever receive when she quickly turn into blatant waifu material. She cooks for Kirito, cleans for Kirito, becomes a stay home mother for Kirito, and when you need her most... she becomes a damsel in distress. Furthermore, her overall romantic relationship with Kirito isn't exciting either despite how much focus goes into it. It's the equivalent of ignorant children trying to act like adults... just awkward and cringe worthy.
Kirigaya Suguha - 
Her relevance in the story is very little and doesn't really need to be in it. Honestly, her purpose is just to be the incestuous interest in Kirito's harem
Yui -
She's like Navi from LoZ, she was intended to be an important asset, but just ended up being annoying and in your way. 
Ayano Keiko - 
Aforementioned unimportant side character from one of the various filler episodes. Again, no purpose other than loli appeal and part of Kirito's harem.
Shinozaki Rika - 
Featuring member number 4 of Kirito's harem. No purpose other than unrequited feelings. Significance is little to nonexistent.
Sachi -
Probably the most genuine character in the entire anime.  Her main struggle is her fear of dying and her unwillingness to fight like the rest of her guild. Which is appropriate given other people would react the same way. This made her more relatable since she has a fear and needs to overcome it to achieve a greater good. A common plight we all face.  It's a shame she wasn't given enough screen time.
Antagonist #1 - 
Rarely shows up until the end. Motive is bland. His whole premise is bland
Antagonist #2 - 
Generic captor of the damsel, except with motives of rape that will make you feel very uncomfortable.  
Enjoyment - (1)
I didn't enjoy it one bit. It's the equivalent of eating a rotten apple. It doesn't taste good in the beginning, it doesn't get any better as you continuing eating it, and you just feel bad after you finish it.
Overall - (3)
The plot is rushed and poorly executed, the characters are boring, and the romantic segments are cringe worthy. It is downright terrible and a perfect example of an anime that just feels uninspiring.
(Note)The main reason why this anime has such a large community is simply because most people don't have the experience to the draw the borders on what's considered ""good"" and ""bad"" (in terms of quality, not personal preference). I admit, I was in those shoes before and thought this show was amazing. But after watching many other animes to then revisit SAO, it hit me on how ignorant I was on all the flaws this show contained. In a sense, this anime was necessary to help draw those borders for anyone who hopes to create unbiased reviews and indulge themselves further in Otakuism.",3
"
                Sword Art Online starts out as one of the best animes I've ever seen.  It's so entertaining and emotional.  I don't think I've ever felt so sad, nor quite as happy while watching an anime as I have when I've watched Sword Art Online.  It's an emotional roller coaster for a solid portion of its duration.  
That being said, the show drops off a bit towards the middle, maybe about 15 episodes in, and just never regains the level of quality and entertainment it had in its first half.  It's still fun to watch at that point, but it feels
                  like a completely different show once the second story arc begins.  At the end of the day though, this is still a very good show, and even if you lose interest its second half, the first 15 or so episodes of this are a memorable and fantastic watch!",9
"
                Despite all negative comments and reviews Sword Art Online has now, Sword Art Online is an amazing anime. I never write reviews, but I feel like since SAO has been getting this backlash/negative image, many people dismiss it and expect it to be horrible. I put it on hold when I heard a lot of my friends saying it was bad, but I continued watching it recently.
Story: 10/10 The story is so creative. The plot was amazing and out of the box. I loved the whole concept of Kirito getting trapped in the game and has to fight all of the bosses. Many complain that
                  it became ""ecchi"" or ""harem""; I did not see any of that in the anime. Although occasionally girls flock to Kirito, it only happened a few times and for a few minutes of the anime. He wasn't some guy with half naked girls following him and not sure which girl to choose like in other animes. There was no love triangle. There was unrequited love and then there was the love between Asuna and Kirito. Their relationship pushed the story forward because it gave both of them a sense to protect each other and would lead to the final arc, with Kirito wanting to save Asuna from another videogame. There were 4 other girls that liked Kirito. 2 of them were shown in less than a minute. One was gone after one episode. The last girl was more important, but there was no chance of Kirito loving her because he loved Asuna. Although love was a big part of SAO, the girls overall were a very minimal part and nothing to cringe about. It was a great story!
Art: 9/10 The art was great. It was very cool to watch when Kirito was fighting. (OP Main Characters are always cool to watch) I liked it. I gave it a nine because I didn't want to give everything a 10. Maybe it could had been improved to like Your Lie in April level, but the art was nice.
Sound: 10/10 No complaints about sound. I liked the theme songs.
Character: 10/10 I hated Sugou, but he's the antagonist. I just wanted to punch him, so that ending was very fulfilling and pleasing to me. Kirito, Yui, and Asuna are lovely characters who I never got annoyed at. Yui was cute. Kirito was super cool at fighting and he wasn't sucked into the affections of other girls. He was kind and he learned how to accept people whether in the virtual world or in real life. There was development. Although her development isn't really shown, she learned by being with Kirito that she should make the most of her life in SAO to not waste her life in the real world.
Enjoyment: 10/10 great
Overall: Outstanding - 10",10
"
                To call this anime amazing would be a far stretch, seeing as it has been done before in .hack//SIGN and the early Accel World -- which, ironically, is by the same creator as SAO.
Let's start off with the basics. Your investment in this anime is going to either be positive or negative. If you like the MMO genre, then you will probably love it. But if you have seen this story before, you will probably pass. 
The story starts off great, but leads to some problems later on. The second ""arc"" of the anime feels rushed, and half done. The first season is probably the
                  most developed, and doesn't feel pressed for time. To be honest, ALfheim Online/Fairy Dance arc should have been a separate series of its own, and not crammed into one season.
The Story:
Kirito Kirigaya is a beta tester of the new virtual reality game, Sword Art Online. Along with thousands of other players, he realizes he is trapped within the game and cannot log out. Throughout many adventures, Kirito becomes stronger and strives to beat the game so that everyone can be free.
This arc is the best in the series, and fully develops the characters. You have gorgeous music from Yuki Kajiura. The world feels realistic, and you feel invested in the characters.
But before you start the second arc, think about what I just said. You feel invested. You understand why you care so much about them. You really feel sorry for them. They feel like Mary Sue's and Gary Stu's, but you let it go. You shrug it off. It's a great story. It has heart. It has emotion. You feel certain that the characters will achieve all they hope to.
But then you watch Episode 14, and you barely feel invested in any of the characters. The story pushes too far forward. Not to mention, at the end of the story, you barely feel any romance between Asuna and Kirito because of Suguha.
The Music:
Like I said, it's superb. Really great work by Yuki Kajiura. I love the music and it makes me feel more aware of the battles being intense, whereas if it was rock music. 
The Art:
Graphics are great, feels realistic, but also easy on the eyes.
Total: 6/10, solely because it has been done before. And time and time again, the characters do things that do feel unrelatable. Also feels like they are trying too hard to throw in scenes that are not too easy on the eyes -- tentacles, rape threats -- and make it uncomfortable, and just awkward. These could be done better, but just feel forced after all the characters have been through.",7

                Sword Art Online
(seasons 1 and 2)
3/10
Summary
Sword Art Online is about a virtual reality video game that that has been diabolically designed so that logging out is impossible; logging out is only possible once the game has been beaten. But the biggest twist is that death in the video game equals death in real life. 
The main characters are Kirito and Asuna. A love story quickly develops around these too as they use their skills to continually try to beat the game as well as helping others survive along the way.
Upsides
The uniqueness of the story is beneficial to viewers. There have not been many other animes
                  that have infused video games and life and death situations. 
After going through many life and death situations themselves Kirito and Asuna develop a strong bond with one another that is captured throughout the story.
Downsides
As unique and exciting as the plot may sound, the writing makes the plot anticlimactic and boring. Sword art Online does not follow Kirito and Asuna throughout their entire journey; instead it just follows them through a few of their more intense fight scenes which can come months after each other according to the date that appears at the beginning of most episodes. This can be annoying. Also the fight scenes are painfully predictable. There is almost never a point where you doubt the fact that Kirito will win as he establishes himself as being virtually omnipotent for no apparent reason after the first couple episodes.
Even if for some reason one really enjoys the fight scenes in Sword Art Online they won’t be too pleased with the anime. This is because the better part of the anime is spent with Kirito and Asuna going on picnics and flirting with each other.
After the first arc where they are trapped inside the video game the story somehow manages to get worse. It really seemed like the writer had no idea what was going to happen after the first arc so he just kind of made it up as he went along. However the Death Gun arc that takes pace later in the series does present itself as better than all of the arcs that occur after the first one. Even so that is not saying much. There is even an arc that is simply Kirito and his friends trying to find an item in a video game where it doesn’t matter if they die because they won`t die in real life! Most of the series is tantamount to waiting in line for your chance to play a video game.",3

                SAO (Sword Art Online)
Sword Art Online is medieval-time Virtual MMORPG game where the player would put on a helmet, and enter the game. taking place in a 100 floor giant floating castle call Aincrad where each floor (Lvl) has in own  monsters, quest, bosses. To pass to the next floor someone needs to defeat the Floor Boss for someone to go forward.
But after the Beta came out, and it was public for the world, the creator Akihiko Kayaba takes out the log-out bottom, so all the players would be trap. And the only way for everyone to escape is to beat all the 100
                  floors and defeat the last boss. And if anyone would of die or someone from the outside world takes out the helmet, the helmet would send a electric shock to the brain burning it and killing the player.
The whole series, takes place in the game seeing a few cut-scene of the outside world. You see how the players interact with one each other finding out to get out of the game without dying. Some players decide to join gilts and others decide to stay in the first floor hoping someone would beat the game. And others had the decide to make the ultimate action and killed themselves.
Like that is how we meet our, Protagonist  Kazuto Kirigaya a.k.a Kirito as his Avatar name, after being one of the lucky 1000 players that were chosen to play the close Beta. Kirito has some inside knowledge of the game, and how it works he puts out his goal to finish the game before anyone else. But finding out that his trap in the game everything changes. Kirito being a Beta player decides to go Solo instead of joining a party, because the fact that he thinks they going to slow him down, and he can't withstand the dead of other players. You cannot really connect with Kirito, just the fact that his to much of a cocky player, thinking his above everyone else. Two years has passed and no one has pass the games. Later on Kirito meets this girl name Asuna even though she's in a gilt, she shows that she's is a good of a Solo player like Kirito. Kirito ends up falling in love with Asuna promise her that he will find away to beat the game so, they can be together in the real world.
If you like a anime with a mayor conflict, action and some romantic in it, this the anime for you.",7
"
                tl;dr Sure, you may have to suspend belief about or overlook an occasional plot hole or character annoyance, but in the end this is a highly entertaining anime with great art and sound, an enjoyable setting and characters, and a solid story.
NOTE: Just because you don't agree with my score, don't vote ""not helpful""! Please read the review first and judge the review for what it is, not if you agree with me. That's not the point of those buttons.
Ah, Sword Art Online. An anime that has caused a massive division among anime fans - some hate it, others love it. Where do I stand?
                  Somewhere towards the love side - I really enjoyed it, but there were still a few issues that bugged me at points.
Story: 8
The story is certainly an interesting one, one that grabbed my attention the moment I first heard someone talk about it - thousands of players logging into a new VRMMO (something I wish existed!) are suddenly trapped in the game, unable to log out; and if they die in game, they die in real life, as the VR headset the players wear in real life will fry their brains. From the first episode, I was hooked - I wanted to see more of the world, learn how this all managed to happen, and see what the cast of characters (further discussed below) got themselves up to. 
I do agree with a common criticism in that the second half of the season wasn't quite as good as the first half (the concept of dying in game = dying in real life is removed!), though I will vouch that it still has the same feel as the first half - the same great components making up the show as well - and I was just as interested to see the progression of the Alfheim (ALO) arc as I was the Aincrad (SAO) arc. While some character changes seemed a bit large, they were required for the progression of the story and honestly it didn't seem too strange based on the context they happened in. 
There were certainly some amazing build-ups throughout the anime, and the crescendos of these scenes were always a joy to see play out. However, I was a bit bugged by the way certain plot devices would be dropped or overlooked or seemingly forgotten so as to move the plot forwards. I was also oh so slightly disappointed by the last few minutes of the concluding episode, because while it was still strong and had a good message (for the characters and the viewer), I wish it had focused on a different character (you'll probably know what I mean when you see it). However, the last few seconds basically make up for that, so it's not a major negative in any way. There were also a few plot twists that I did not see coming, which I always enjoy. What's important in the end, though, is that I still found the story to pretty pretty damn enjoyable. So in summary, while there was a bit of a drop in quality in the second half, along with a few convenient plot devices left out, he story was pretty enjoyable and I was always interested to see what happened next to our cast of characters and in the worlds of Aincrad and Alfheim.
Art/Animation: 9
The art and animation in Sword Art Online really is quite impressive. The character designs were strong, as were the enemy designs. There were lots of bright colors that popped off the scream and darker colors that set a brooding or tense mood. The worlds of Aincrad and Alfheim were both a treat to look at, and my god the battle animations: those were amazing. I looked forwards to every battle despite the danger to the characters because of how wonderful they looked, they were a real treat. Emotions were well depicted - happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc; for example, the fear a player would show when encountering the boss was really quite believable, as were the emotions conveyed throughout certain character's relationships. The only, very slight negative I have is that I wish one or two certain battles were animated rather than still images, but they were still great to watch so it's not a huge deal in the end.
Sound: 10
The sound was another really, really strong part of the SAO package. The OP and ED were both very good (though it changes at the beginning of the ALO arc to different songs, though I still enjoyed them). The soundtrack was wonderful; I'm actually listening to it now as I write the review. Some convey great emotions and struggles, others convey the feeling of epicness we get during battle sequences, and others are just played as the world is explored and characters converse - every track is strong and I'm actively searching for a way to (legally, of course) download the soundtrack (I already bought the OP on iTunes). Some favorite tracks of mine include Swordland, Luminous Sword, At Nightfall, A Tender Feeling, Aincrad, We Have To Defeat It, Fight!, Gracefully, With My Friend, Critical Phase, and Dance With Me. In addition to the score, the voice acting was also quite good, both in English and Japanese - the voice actors were very strong in their roles and you could hear and feel the emotions that characters were portraying. (Fun fact: in English, the voice actor who plays Kirito also plays Eren in Attack on Titan, which was kind of cool as they are similar-ish characters).
Characters: 7
Looking back on SAO subjectively, the characters are the one component that I felt was slightly lacking. I did really like certain characters, but with the ""perma-death"" effect, others were killed off before I really began to care about them. Other characters seemed interesting but weren't quite developed enough, or just as they began to be developed they would be killed off. Certain characters just aren't particularly strong overall; a bit underwhelming to be honest. There was even one main character who I was not particularly fond of when they were first introduced, but they later grew into a character I enjoyed. I loved some characters, I hated some characters (in a good way!), but there were some that just weren't developed enough for me to get an opinion on or disappointed me because of said lack of development. Keep in mind: it's not that the characters who are there are bad! I liked the vast majority of them. It's more of a lack of time with certain characters that I was a bit disappointed with.
The relationships portrayed throughout the course of the story are pretty good; Kirito does seem to have a harem of sorts, but it's not overbearing: the side ones come in and out very quickly, and it's quite obvious who Kirito actually cares for early on. Seeing their relationship develop was really entertaining and emotional; certain scenes made me smile and others made me share in their sadness. Some side characters are pretty strong as well - not all are underdeveloped! I enjoyed Klein, Sybil, Leafa, and Heathcliffe a lot.
Being an 18 year old male, I found it pretty easy to identify aspects of my own personality and beliefs in Kirito and sympathize with him and his plight, and I'm sure many others watching will be able to identify with other characters as well, as many have their own personalities and struggles to deal with that will resonate with many different types of viewers.
So, while it was slightly disappointing that certain characters were underdeveloped, I did still enjoy the main characters, as well as some of the primary side characters. I, for one, enjoyed how the relationships played out, and a certain relationship that develops in the second half leaves Kirito confused, but the way it is dealt with is also quite appropriate.
Enjoyment: 9
If you enjoy a show with extremely good art and animation, a beautiful and epic soundtrack, and an entertaining story with characters you may be able to see parts of yourself in, you'll certainly like this. If you don't particularly like romance or some comedy in what could otherwise be a very serious show, you probably won't like this. However, most people with an open mind who go into the series (and do not simply join the hate or hype train) will probably find themselves pleasantly surprised, much like myself.
Personally, I found the show extremely enjoyable. I was thoroughly entertained throughout and I'd happily recommend this to all my friends. The sound and art are phenomenal, the story is intriguing and has a few plot twists to keep you wondering, and a majority of the characters are pretty strong, and the relationships that develop between many of the characters (both romantic and friendship wise) are well done. There are epic moments, happy moments, sad moments, very emotional moments, hilarious moments, and intense moments. I watched the entire first season in just a few days, and I'd do it all over again. To be perfectly honest, I don't think I'd mind being trapped in the world of SAO. I can't wait to watch Season 2.
Overall, I'd give the show a 8.5/10 (rounded to 9/10), and will certainly be recommending it. To anyone reading the review, please give Sword Art Online a shot. Maybe watching it a second time (for those of you who were disappointed the first time) will give you a new perspective. And to the fresh, new viewers like myself, who simply knew it was a divisive anime about being trapped in a virtual reality MMO: Go in with an open mind (clear it of any negative connotation you heard going in), and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
To all the helpful/not helpful votes, feedback would be appreciated! This is only my third anime review.",9
"
                Sword Art Online is equal parts terrible and awesome. I mean terrible in a bad way and awesome in a good way.
The quick summary:
-The first 13 episodes get an 8/10.
-The last 12 episodes get a 3/10.
-Don't watch it because it will disappoint you in the end no matter how strong it starts.
Lets start with the pros.
Visually, it looks great the whole way through. Action sequences are enjoyable and as flashy as a person could desire. The backgrounds are nicely done and really show the scale of the world that Sword Art Online takes place in.
The sound in Sword Art Online is also a great piece of work. The sound effects are what is expected from the environment presented, and the music is always right where it should be the whole way through.
The story is full of cool and original ideas. Characters are entertaining too.
Now for the cons.
The pacing of the series is difficult to deal with. It's fragmented story telling would work well for some stories but it's really jarring in Sword Art Online. One might argue that it adds to the serious tone of the series, but I'll come back to that in a bit.
The characters might be entertaining, but most of them are very forgettable. The ones most easily remembered had short lived parts as it were and so there is a problem here: unimportant characters are more memorable than the main cast...
While the story has some great and unique ideas they are totally muddled in their presentation. The focus and tone of the show both shift numerous times. It begins as a relatively serious, dark, and action oriented anime before changing into a love story, a harem, a tragedy, and ultimately what feels like canonized hentai fanfiction.
Now back to that earlier bit about arguing the fragmented story telling works for Sword Art Online: it does... for about 5 episodes. That's a mere one-fifth of the series. With the constant shift in tone and direction that style breaks quickly.
Overall, Sword Art Online could have been something amazing which is what it started off as, but ultimately it turned into the some of the worst story telling ever. I would not recommend watching it in full to anybody, but would suggest that viewers watch the first 13 episodes and then stop.",6
"
                First I'm going to start off with the pros of the anime and get to the cons later.
Pros: Good story, awesome openings to both season 1 and 2, entertaining, and overall a good anime. Sword Art Online has its flaws, yes, and it is considered overrated by a lot of people. Even if you see all these bad reviews for it, it is a must watch if you like action or romance animes. There are no really mixed reviews for it and you are either going to see it as the best anime ever or the worst in some cases. The anime in general is
                  just super entertaining especially when it comes to the boss battles that take place in the game.
Cons: Skips around a lot, character development is not great, some parts are just not as entertaining as the other parts of the anime. Explaining more of my list, SAO skips a lot and goes through the story that takes place in the light novels very fast. One episode the main character is on floor 1 and suddenly they are on floor 25. I wish that it didn't do this and doing this would have probably developed the character much more and solve their problem with that. Poor character development is pretty self explanatory but I found that it wasn't much of a problem. Some parts of the anime are not as thrilling. Many people do not like the season after the SAO game part and it goes to the Alfheim Online. I did find the first half much more interesting but the second half stopped skipping around nearly as much and that is why it wasn't as action packed. Just a tip, get over the pointy ears and just accept it.",8

                Hey guys, since this anime was either hated or loved by everyone, I decided to make a review with a little more love for the show. Don't get me wrong, this show had some big flaws, but overall I say I loved it more than I hated it. 
Story - 8 then 4
To start off we have the story. 10,000 people have been stuck in a video game. This reminded me of the movie 'Spy Kids 3' at first. Soon we find out that if you die in the game you die in real life. I like the plot, sounds good and interesting. Our main
                  character is determined to conquer the game and beat all 100 levels and survive. Our character falls in love and they fight together. Perfect amount of Romance and Action is in this show.
The second Arc was rushed, messy and very illogical compared to the first half, if they had taken their time and made it into a well written second season all together it would have been better and would have given everyone a good taste in their mouth after the first arc as they wait for the second arc.
Art - 9
Everything was beautiful from the scenery to the fighting scenes to the characters. Characters were a bit off at times but nothing I can really complain about for the overall quality of the art.
Sound - 9 
90% of the time, I dislike an anime's opening song. Sword art online has a fantastic opening song and it was very catchy and I loved it. The second arc and it's opening song wasn't as good, but I didn't disappoint me honestly. 
Character - 9 then 3 
I loved Kirito when he first started, being a ruthless master of the game, defeating bosses 10 levels higher than him alone without any defense. No time for friends no time for allies he had to get out of the game. He seemed like a man that would carry everyone in the game, and save them all leading them to victory, but I feel when Asuna (Love Intrest) comes in he loves the 'bad ass' attitude he had before. Now he does it for her and for their future. Don't get me wrong, that was great of him, I would have just enjoyed it more if he stayed the silent cold solo man everyone knew him to be.
Asuna is a love/hate character for me, I love her because she is strong and confident and a great fighter, a perfect match for Kirito, but like I said, she made him from the bad ass fighter that wants to destroy everything, to the loving kind sweet-hearted husband. Don't get me wrong, Kirito still does what he does best, but how he does it is completely different which kind of made me sad.
Yui, 'daughter' they met in the game which made the relationship tighten, her appearance is quite random and her presence was unneeded. She was added simply to make it look like they were playing 'house' she was completely unnecessary but played a huge role in the second arc.
Now for the part which everyone hated. Side characters, there shouldn't have been such a thing as a side character in this show. Kirito at first meets Klein, looks like its going to be a good friend for the rest of the series, he teaches him how to play the game and they make a quick friendship that looks like they will last in the long run, but within the first episode Kirito turns down his offer to go solo, that's great, you want to be a solo person. But then Kirito keeps running into him time after time for no apparnet reason at all. It seemed like they needed to waste some time so the decided to throw Klein in there for 2 minutes and wait 6 more episodes before he gets another 2 minutes. Same for the strong looking black man Agil who's job is nothing but to do what Kirito wants (Slavery)
For all the girls Kirito interacts with, Silica and Lizbeth. I love these characters they are great and their episodes are great. Only problem they start to develop feelings for the charming prince who has saved them multiple times and what's even worse is that he has already committed himself to Asuna forever. Yay, Kirito and Asuna 'OTP 5EVR'. These two characters don't appear again until the last two episodes. What was their purpose? To give Kirito some more love that was completely unnecessary, if you are going to give me another character please put more into them and don't just throw them to the side until the show is over and say 'hey lets put them back in the show for the last 2 episodes.' 
Next we have the one character that actually had some meaning in this show that was indeed a side character. Sachi, her purpose was to solely mature Kirito it seemed, because of Sachi, he never wanted to see another death and refused to let anyone else die in his presence. This connects his bond with Asuna and gives him the determination to protect her with all his might. Sachi is the character who changed Kirito and made him into a man who wants to protects what he loves. I'm glad for her.
Lastly we have the  Sister Suguha, I love her to death, personally, only problem is that she doesn't have the same flare as Asuna did back when Asuna was the main Heroine, Suguha had a bad arc and was essentially hated for being the 'OTP breaker' She wasn't needed in that arc, she didn't need to be the 2nd heroine that would help Kiritio because she couldn't handle it. Her presence was made to put pressure on the impenetrable relationship between Asuna and Kirito. I wish she had more purpose than that.
The first Arc Villian was great except that he had no reason to do what he did which put a big knife in the plot which everyone wanted to be a great finish. The second villian was pathetic and weak like the 2nd arc.
Enjoyment - 10
I haven't seen a show that progressed a relationship so flawlessly without being rushed as well as great fighting scenes. In about 16 episodes they created a smooth well developed relationship that made you say 'Oh my god, they are perfect for each other' the creators did a fantastic job when managing between Romance and Action. At first you think it's a Action type anime but it turns out to be a Romantic one with fighting in it and the fighting scenes were greatly enjoyed as you were on your toes waiting how they would survive this encounter if they did at all. In addition, the scenery was great and I very much liked this show.
Overall - 8
This is a great anime and I highly recommend it. If you want to see a beautiful relationship develop and some awesome fighting scenes as well as a bad ass main character. I say you should watch this show. If you don't like all that, just watch it any way to say that you watched it. If you can look at it's great points you can deal with the bad points. Enjoy",8

                Sword Art Online is one of the most controversial animes of 2012, and I think it's obvious why. There are many reasons people treat it very highly or very lowly, but I think in the end, it just matters as to what kind of person you are and what is it that you enjoy.
Story: 8/10
I think Sword Art Online has a good premise. The idea of being trapped into a video game is an interesting angle to take, though I'm sure it must have been done before. Many people look lowly on Sword Art Online because of it's story, but I think that it's fine.
                  It's not amazing to the point where it needs a score of 9 or 10, but to me very well deserves a score over 7. 
I think the story has a specific effect on you because of the kind of person you are and what you like. Let's be honest, Sword Art Online is very concentrated on romance. While this anime has a ""shounen"" like label, it does have very ""shoujo""-esque characteristics to it. 
This is either a good or bad thing, depending on who you are. Most people think Sword Art Online's story line is very weak because of romance, because other than that, nothing really happens. Which in itself is sort of true. But I mean, if you are one of those people who is a sucker for romance and fluff, the anime is quite enjoyable. It all depends on your personality. If you're looking for an extremely action-packed fighter anime, it definitely isn't the first choice. However, if you're looking for a romance anime that doesn't choke you in frills and ribbons, this is definitely somewhere to go.
Art: 9/10
I think that A-1 Pictures did an extremely well done job with the art and animation of Sword Art Online. The style of drawing is fairly typical, but it is executed very well. Designs are done crisply, cleanly, and are attractive to the eye. Likewise, backgrounds and little details are drawn to detail, which is appreciated and adds to the overall atmosphere of the anime. Particularly, battle scenes in Sword Art Online were positively breath-taking. It was those scenes that you really felt a rush of adrenaline, no doubt fueled by the almost  flawless battle animations.
The only downside I think to this anime was the drawing of the girls of the anime. Do all the girls need to show much cleavage? Even more so, do all of the girls need to have to be so... ""well developed"", so to say? With the exception of Yui, who is a child, all the girls basically band together to make up an insane amount of over-exaggerated, tiring eye candy.
Sound: 9/10
The sound of Sword Art Online was done very well. Paired with the art, it makes for an unforgettable experience. The soundtrack of Sword Art Online matches with every scene that they are put into, helping to establish the atmosphere along with the artwork. 
In total, Sword Art Online has 2 opening themes and 2 ending themes, both with an obvious stronger winner.
The first opening theme ""Crossing Fields"" by LiSa is breath-taking. It has a tremendous build from the verse to the chorus and no doubt takes great skills to reach all the high notes that make it so much more powerful and energizing. It captures the essence of the video game ""Sword Art Online"" very well.
The second opening theme ""Innocence"" by Aoi Eri is not so much so. The second arc of the anime is very less 'tense' so to say. For that reason it fits with the opening. Though, it is definitely the less memorable of the two opening themes.
The same is true ending themes, but opposite. I find ""Overfly"" by Luna Haruna to be more pleasing to than ""Yume Sekai"" by Tomatsu Haruka. Possibly because ""Overfly"" is more dramatic than ""Yume Sekai"" but no doubt both fit the anime as to close it off, leaving the viewer on a satisfied note.
Character: 7/10
While the characters lack an impact that's truly memorable, I think it's fair to give them an 7/10. 
Kirito (aka Kirigaya Kazuto) is the main protagonist of the series. He's a person who apparently closed himself off to other people at a young age, making him sort of awkward with weird people skills. Regardless, because of this, he's a big video game player and is a very powerful player. There is not anything particularly memorable to him, but in the end I find him to be likable. While he is seen as a ""lone-wolf"" character so to say, he is actually very sweet underneath it all. He actually is a little bit clueless but nonetheless knows to fight for the things he loves. The one thing that bothered me was the fact that he was a chick magnet without even trying. It just didn't make sense to me that someone who was an awkward people person who hardly ever went out was so popular with people. 
The main female protagonist of the series Asuna (aka Yuuki Asuna) is a character I think was a little neglected when it came to designing her character in her psychological side. Her appearance is fine, I think what just bothered me was they hyped her up as an independent 'I don't need anyone' character, only for her to fall into the trap of ending up being just another tsundere who isn't particularly special at all. In fact, she ends up just being a typical damsel in distress, rendering her simply as a plot device by the end. However, despite this, Asuna is someone who cares deeply, who has her own independent streaks. 
There are many other characters to this anime who frankly don't really need to be explained, because they are for the most part sidelined, with the exception of Suguha, who is only a main character in the second arc of the anime, and she is mostly used in a failed attempt at a love triangle.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Despite all it's flaws, I enjoyed Sword Art Online very much. It had me crying, screaming, cooing and everything in between. It pulled me in to the point where I finished it in 2 days; which is quite the feat for someone like me. All in all, the anime was just enjoyable because of it's ability to relate to things I like. And I'm a sucker for canon couples; so that plays a factor into it too.
Overall: 8/10
All in all, I think Sword Art Online is a well done anime. No, it isn't the best out there, but I don't think it's right to say it's very bad either. It's right there in the middle, though leaning more to the good side for me than the bad side. It's definitely something I would watch again and is definitely worth giving it a chance!",8
"
                 This might sound random but before saying anything about the anime I would like to introduce myself. Now first of all I am an 18 year old boy, I normally spend my time drawing (not only manga but follow me here) and reading manga, watching anime. So I normally look for something to inspire me. Anyways what made me watch SAO. I hadn't started watching anything apart from One Piece and new Hunter X Hunter but I greadually found out how this new anime had turned so popular. I remembered reading the first chapter of the manga once but I was reluctant to continue.
                  Anyways I was a sucker I decided to try out the anime. It sucked me in right from the begining. Now what makes Sao different.
 I will try to do this in a spoiler free way. So where do I start. Well the story it's absolutely fascinating. I've somehow learned that what really sucks in viewers is when the anime is so close to their desires and still be realistic. I am not talking about harems or anything but the sole fact that the story does sound really possible in terms of technology. The way people talk about NPC and stuff make it sound strange but it somehow sounds realistic. I am also a sucker for another thing romance. Bah I don't know why but I like watching these kind of things and I hadn't done it a while. I only draw fighthing scenes and watched shonens till now it was really something I needed. But it was just too much it took me in right away and I watched every episode available in a day. 
 Anyways on to the characters. To be honest I think this is the main downfall of the anime. Not to mention the fact that it seemed a bit rushed. I mean in my opinion the episodes should be doubled (but let's expect 25 more eps in the future shall we). So the characters well they are how do I say we weren't given enough time to get accustomedto them. And I am talking not only about side characters but the main too. I think that in this situation more information should have been given about the main characters in total. But the whole thing just, as I said before, seemed rushed. I won't speak here anymore so that I don't start giving away spoilers.
 The sound is top notch. I can say that the op is pretty much perfect. I don't listen to ed's and the battle music oh it reminds me of Final Fantasy actually. I somehow feel it suits an mmorpg game so it's pefect.
 Enjoyment well I pretty much said it before but hell yeah this can keep me watching for hours. 
 Overall it deserves a 10 in my opinion. It's not the greatest anime of all time but it really is extraordinary compared to others. I would recommend this to anyone who likes (or at least doesn't hate) Romance.",10
"
                MOD EDIT: Review contains spoilers.
Let me put this simply: I fucking hate Sword Art Online.
This anime is perhaps the worst thing that I have ever had the misfortune of watching all the way through.  At first, I had watched it and liked it.  That was years ago.  But then when I rewatched it, I realized just how dreadful this abomination is.
Let me start with the main character, Kirito.  He is perhaps the worst main character I've ever seen for a protagonist.  He is overpowered to the highest degree of the word.  With his unique duel-wielding ability (which adds on
                  to his godlike powers) he was able to single-handedly take down a damn boss.  A BOSS!  He was also able to break out of a paralysis and come back to life out of damn sheer willpower EVEN THOUGH the NerveGear was supposed to fry his brain after he died.  
He also has a solid following of three girls that he left completely alone, all of who at one point fell in love with him-we'll call them the Lonely Women's Club.  The members of the wonderful club include Suguha, who he knew as Leafa in Alfheim, was his own cousin who fell in love with Kirito, and two other girls I don't care to remember because they're so meaningless.  One of those two girls was a repeat victim of tentacles holding her in the air, revealing her panties.
And the Alfheim arc is completely irrelevant and insulting.  Never has an anime insulted me more than the Alfheim arc.  Asuna-who I genuinely like and is one of the saving graces of this show (more on that later)-was raped two or three times on screen while I was forced to watch.  And in this arc, Kirito also spent most of his time dicking around in the Alfheim world while on a pressing time limit of six days until Asuna was forced into a non-consentual marriage with her rapist.  Kirito spent most of this fighting some guy with red hair and then fending off a group with his demon transformation spell, which never appeared again in the entire anime even though there were multiple prime opportunities for it to appear once more for a fight.  And while I'm on the topic of fighting, all of the fights in this series were laughably bad.  The fight choreography is some of the worst I've ever seen in my entire life.  It's just terrible.
I could keep going on and on about how bad this anime is, but maybe now I should focus on the anime's saving graces.
Asuna is the first of two  She isn't an interesting character for a tsundere, but often times is the only rational voice in the entire show and usually is the only character to say anything that makes any sense  Also, there's the music.  While in SAO 2 the music is far better (aside from ending songs), I did enjoy the music in SAO a lot.  ""Crossing Field"" is a decent OP, but the same does not stand true for the Alfheim arc.  The BGM is also usually good, especially in fights.  But that's pretty much it.  A single character and the music are the only things I find enjoyable about this anime.",1
"
                I've got to say that Sword Art Online was a bit of a disappointment. The potential this anime had. They could have become one of my all time avourite anime's. The plot is in the near future people have created a 'nerve gear' which allows people to go into the virtual world of Sword Art Online. People to start to log into the the game but the people who are playing soon find out they can't leave and if someone disconnects there nerve gear they will die. The only way to leave is to go through all 100 levels the game has and each level
                  has an overpowered boss that people need to team up to kill. (except for our main protagonist Kirito who is pretty much invincible and can kill everything)
That sounds like one of the best and original idea for an anime. Don't expect to see 100 bosses though because you only get 4. Me being a big fan of anime and video games thought this would be amazing, combining the two. At first it was alright but all the time jumps and bland characters started to make it go down hill.
The very worst part was the abysmal story arc of Elfheim online. It was pointless and boring and what happens if you die....Oh no you have to re-spawn at the start. I would of muched prefered just a bunch cool boss fights. The boss fight in Sword Art are Amazing. It almost makes up for the rest of the anime.
Its not the worst thing ever though, its just a overated and a waste of a good idea. The art style was nice and it was done especially well during the fight scenes. The music is just Amazing, the fight music and the intro's. This anime had so much going for it.
The characters were horrible in sword art. Kirito was just a boring loner of a kid who (like alot of anime) every girl falls for him. He meets a bunch of girls during his travels and every one gets one episode and you barley see them again except for Asuna the main love interest to our protagonist Kirito. The love story kind of felt pushed and rushed in sword art, and there relationship takes up alot of the time during 3 episodes where alot of good stuff could of happened.
I did enjoy the anime though and it was appealing to the eye. It just could of been better. I was very entertained during the main Sword art part but i can't really recall much from Alfheim. I do recommend this anime and im hoping the next part of Sao Gun gale could redeem the show.
Thanks for reading my reveiw and just remember this is my opinion so you can say this is the best show in the world!",6

                WARNING THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN (lots) OF SPOILERS! I AM NOT LIABLE OF ANY BLAME REGARDING SPOILING THE CONTENT. VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED. 
Noticeably from the hype aroused around 2014, Sword Art Online has been one of the most popular animes that have yet to come this year. Seeing all the excellent reviews it has collected (perhaps too excellent), I decided to go mainstream and watch the whole season of SAO season 1 in a week.
I started watching SAO anticipating it would be a thrilling anime mainly about action, adventure and maybe a little bit of romance. From the first few episodes this anime had
                  without a doubt shown a promising storyline, and an interesting fantasy world, yearning for the viewers to explore. However, right when the anime seemingly starts to approach its climax, the whole show becomes a complete disaster. 
After finishing SAO, I was glad it was (finally) over. With the sheer amount of plot holes and bad characterization this anime has, I am going to bring up a conclusion that Sword Art Online is the most overrated anime in existence.To be brief, I brought up a number of bullet points to depict the pros and cons in the following categories:
~Story~ 
Pros:
- Unique and somewhat interesting plot
-Follows the theme of MMO's and gaming fantasy worlds, unused before. 
Cons:
- Transition between episode to episode is EXTREMELY bad. I've literally jumped into the next episode wondering if I accidentally missed out an episode. Then I realized it was just the bad transitioning and ""forwarding time"".
- The anime suddenly became an awfully made romance, ever since the arrival of *sighs* Asuna. 
~Character~
Pros:
I can't think of any, sorry.
Cons:
Characterization is inevitably the worst thing about this anime. Every character seems to have this typical, bland feeling in them. 
-Asuna is probably the most disappointing out of all of them. During the first or second episode, I've anticipated Asuna to be the most interesting one of the characters so far, mainly because of her mysterious background, her shy nature and the subtlety of her character. Then arriving at about the fifth episode, she unexpectedly becomes this extroverted, strong-willed and seductive character that leaves the viewer going like 'what the fuck'. 
-Kirito's (and most of the other characters in the anime) characterization is also extremely bad, following Asuna's. At first the viewers are thought to believe that he is introverted, and has a somewhat forlorn, lonely nature. Then when he jumps straight into battle he becomes this hyper-willed, overpowered character that, similarly to Asuna, contradicts his personalities. He's bland and boring to look at as a whole. 
~Sound~
Pros:
-Mediocre-ly epic soundtrack
Cons:
Haven't really thought about any. 
~Enjoyment~
Pros:
-The action within the story is somewhat enjoyable to watch
Cons:
-The storyline eventually whittles down into a boring, badly-designed romance and action theme. 
~Art~
Pros:
-Amazing artwork, probably the only thing this anime is good at. Especially when viewing in HD 1080p, along with the action the viewers are left drooling in front of their computer screens. 
Cons:
-Some characters *cough* Sugu *cough* have overly massive tits for their age. 
~Overall~
5~6/10 
I thought I was being generous here. I honestly can't believe SAO is even compared to Attack on Titan - SAO is evidently way out of it's league. To put it crudely, the main idea/theme is good, but how they handled it was bad. The art and sound were fine but the characterization is terrible.  
Improvements I think that will drastically make this a better anime:
- Scrap the whole mirror thing at the start, and add a plot twist where Asuna was secretly a guy from the start, and Kirito becomes mindfucked into permanent psychological damage once he realizes. 
- Remove Asuna
- Complicate Kirito's relationship with Asuna by letting Liz interefere in NOT ONLY JUST ONE EPISODE. 
- Make Kirito suddenly turn gay.
- Transform the anime into a heavily romanced hentai or a harem, since the creators already insisted on doing so.
- Remove all the romance because that's basically where all the faults are at lol. 
As a sidenote, I haven't been 100% serious when writing this review and I personally think that my review is biased and poorly written (I had tons of fun though). So please don't go sending me death threats (especially you SAO lovers).",5
"
                I'm writing this review because it appears that, despite plenty of fans rating this anime as a 9 or 10, the people writing reviews and rating reviews are primarily haters.
Story: 9
The story is fairly simple, everybody is trapped in a virtual world where death is real and the only escape is beating 100 levels of monsters and bosses which threaten your life.  However, the story also encompasses the romance which develops between Kirito and Asuna throughout the levels.  People who down-rate this story are usually upset that it's not intricate enough.  If you're looking for something more intricate I suggest you leave
                  and watch Death Note or some other psycho-thriller.
Art: 9
The art was excellent, but not perfect.  There are minor flaws which definitely become more prevalent in the second season of the anime.
Sound: 10
The music was wonderful as were the voices, I have no complaints for sound. Disclaimer: I watched this anime subbed, not dubbed.
Character: 10
This is the winning point which causes me to give this anime a 10.  The character development throughout the anime is extraordinarily pleasant, and doesn't create awkward moments like numerous other anime (I'll refrain from naming them).  Kirito is obviously an Ace (aka overpowered character), but that doesn't detract from developing the MMO solo-player as he interacts with others and falls in love.  I can't explain every aspect of this, but if you're interested watch the anime.
Enjoyment: 10
I loved watching this anime.  Every episode was enjoyable regardless of whether is was serious or not.  When my friends told me to watch this anime season 1 had just finished, and I watched straight through without breaks because I didn't see any reason to stop.  One minor flaw is the constant skipping of time intervals.  The story jumps from level to level without explaining what happened at the levels in between (ex. 9 to 25 without any episodes in between).  However, if you can use basic logic you'll realize that 100 episodes to beat a video game isn't necessary.
Overall: 10
I'm sure I'm about to piss off a ton of the people who bitch about this anime.  Well, I don't care.  Helpful or Not Helpful, I strongly recommend this anime to anybody looking to enjoy an action-romance anime which does both genres justice and is an easy watch overall.",10
"
                Imagine that one day you're playing a game and meeting new people when suddenly someone tells you that you are traped into the game and you can't escape unless you finish the game. Otherwise, you will die in real life. 
And this his how Sword Art Online (or SAO) starts: with the promise of fighting, violence, supervivence, blood and death. However, time passes and nothing of this occurs. Nobody dies and the characters never care about their potential deaths. 
Story:
First of all, I want to say that this show's story has a LOT of potential. Wasted potential, of course, because the story is the most
                  awful thing I've ever seen in an anime series. They only play a game, and nothing more. Well, there are fights and battles, but these are too short and that causes a lack of excitement in the spectator. 
So if you want to watch how some people play a MMORPG, give a opportunity to this. If not, then abandon it. Because in SAO, nothing happens. I promise. 
Characters:
All characters are just pathetic. The protagonist is a bad-ass boy that always wins ever fight and knows every secret placer or weapon or everything in the game. And his companion is a stupid girl that has no special hability. Well, you won't find any reason to love (or like) them. 
And that's all. Those two are the only characters in this show. There are more, of course, but they appear in a chapter and dissapear forever. No character developing, yeah. And not even the opportunity to know them better. 
Of course, there are some positive points in this: art, music and animation are good. But, as I said before, the most important things (story & characters) are simply horrible. 
I don't recommend this to anyone but my worst enemies (and I'm not sure if I even recommend SAO to them, because it's a cruel punishment watching this series).",2
"
                Sword Art Online (SAO) caught my eye quickly i was longing for an anime where its well animated and video game based. This review will be my experience watching SAO.
The story was acceptable with the video game aspect, as the synopsis says. That is how I thought the entire anime, but I was wrong half way through with the anime.
The art and sound were amazing. The animation was nice and crisp with normal scenes, but with the fight scenes the way they interpret the clashing of swords and such was better than most anime. Sometime the music showed more emotion than the actual characters.
At the
                  start of SAO i was enjoying it quick well Kazuto (main character) was a geek as it appeared with him being a gamer and being antisocial. His character development was interesting, a good fighter but didn't know how to handle others. Asuna was a terrible heroin in my eyes. She tried to be the damsel in distress and a warrior at the same time, which can not work.
I enjoyed the first half of SAO, if this review was only on the first half it would be a higher score, but it isn't. The anime ended terribly and not how I wanted. There are things I would love to touch up on but I don't want to spoil anything. This was a huge disappointment, but as its over I find myself wanting more. I feel they should try to redeem themselves and release a second season. In the end Sword Art Online is getting an overall rating of 5.",5
"
                EDIT: I admit, I should probably finish a series before I submit a review. In that sense my opinion is a little unfair, but I feel that I did watch enough of the series to understand what it was about and where it was going. I couldn't stand how the story was progressing and never really truly enjoyed more than 2-3 episodes so this is just my opinion up until where I stopped. I will write a better updated review after (someday) finishing the series.
I had really high expectations for Sword Art Online because of all the hype the show had and the first episode
                  really interested me, but unfortunately I was really disappointed with the direction it took. I tried watching it up to episode 18 and stopped. Honestly, it would've been a lot better if it had just ended after the first ""arc"".
Positives: the music was amazing (Yuki Kajiura is always a great composer), and the animation was high quality.
But the story was just awful...
In short, my main complaints are:
- Too many time skips. Storyline is very jumpy.
- Kirito is the all amazing, way over-powered character. Why? Because he played the beta...
- The characters all have very flat and boring personalities with little to no development. Relationships between characters seem very forced. A lot of characters are introduced but you don't get enough time with any of them to really start to get attached to them. 
It's really too bad because I felt like the show had potential, but without spoiling it: I never found a reason to care about any of the characters, and the story got really old really fast.",5

                Sword Art Online (SAO) was one of the, if not the most hyped-about anime of 2012, spanning 25 episodes and was some of the most talked about topic for anime viewers for several weeks. It ended on the 21st and after spending a whole day for a full marathon, I just can’t resist writing about this series as after watching it I felt like how I felt after I watched Guilty Crown; It was good, but made me felt that it was incomplete or that something very wrong had happened here.
Sword Art Online, adapted from a light novel by Reki Kawahara , who also written
                  Accel World which also had an anime adaptation earlier in the year. They both had similar theme of VRMMOG (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Game) but they have very different premises, progress and feel. I had really enjoyed Accel World earlier and while I wasn’t particularly interested in SAO, I did have certain expectations for the story.
The Premise of SAO was a simple but extremely interesting one, people trapped inside a Virtual Reality Game controlled by a mad scientist who where you will die IRL if u die in the game and the only way to get out of the game is to clear the game. It was interesting to see the perspectives that the show would take into this topic as the setting seemed worthy of a dark, gloomy and cynical adventure story of people trapped inside the game.
But the show had taken a different turn. The pacing of the show was one of the things that really made it suffer as the entire first arc, which spanned 14 episodes had a crammed timeline of nearly two years in it. The result out of this was that the whole thing came out really fragmented and it had left some dissatisfaction after watching it. The first few episodes of the show was more or less about our protagonist’s initial experience inside the game it was done in episodic fashion with large time skips in between and involved a lot of social interaction between our solo player protagonist with others, many of which were girls. It almost had seemed that he was building a large harem and it was almost annoying as it seemed that these were almost more like side stories that in the end had little impact on the overall plot.
The main romance in the series between Kirito and Asuna as I see had also suffered this problem. Their early interactions also had time skips in between them and it made them seem like their relationship development had taken big blind jumps while the actual timeline would have had allowed them to develop the way it did . Their relationship also seemed to have taken centre stage in the story and made it seem also that the original objective had been almost forgotten, so forgotten that by the time the original objective came back into view, the whole arc was forced to an end in less than 3 episodes in a early final battle where a slightly ass-pulled victory was achieved over the mad scientist who probably let it happened.
The second arc of the show focused on Kirito rescuing Asuna who is still trapped, only in another game by the new antagonist, Asuna’s extremely creepy fiancé who wanted to possess her. Again the pacing of the story really made it suffered again as the whole thing only spanned around 10 episodes and while the timeline fitted better, the speed at which things were moving at was still slightly too fast. Also, the second arc had one major disadvantage comparing to the first, the threat of death was gone and so the focus of the show had to be shifted completely away from the original which had taken a lot of the grip that the show originally had on the viewers and focus on the drama of the show.
The second arc also had its own strong budding relationship/romance between Kirito and his imouto/itoko who had feelings for her brother in the first place then fell for Kirito in the game, whose identity she didn’t know about till near the end of the series. The whole thing was resolved in a duel and a big “I’m sorry” hug which made her into a near supporting character. 
Overall, the major flaw of the show was its pacing, and because of the pacing that many other problems arises. One is characterisation and character development, especially in the first arc. The characters seem to have different characteristics each episode, made evident by Kirito, who was screaming “I will survive” in the first episode, blaming himself and isolating himself for the death of a guild he joined to rescuing girls and taking afternoon naps on the front-line a few episodes later. The changes are obvious and slightly dramatic but may actually make more sense when taken into context of the time line of the series.
Some characters on the other hand, were really underdeveloped and whose actions were either really obvious or left for guessing. There were two antagonists in the series; one was the game creator/mad scientist Akihiko Kayaba whose motives in the end remain a complete mystery and whose role in the end has become some sort of Godly manipulator who is pulling the strings on the whole thing. The second antagonists, Nobuyuki Sugou, Asuna’s extremely creepy fiancé who was a shallow, one dimensional character, who was the archetype “drunk on power” supervillan who definitely had some kind of god complex. Both of these character who have had major roles to play are given little screen time and then having to play out big scenes and with nearly no insight into their behaviour.
The fighting in the series is also something to take note of, as there was relatively little heavy combat for such a strongly fighting-themed series, the fights were relatively short and also pretty predictable, as the Gary Stu protagonist will defeat his opponent either through a hidden skill or a slightly more shounen-ish “willpower” charge or even more blatantly, actually “cheating” by gaining access to the GM’s account.
In my opinion, the big mistake made in this series was the lack of in-depth exploration to the emotions and experience of the players in this simulacrum and the impact on reality. It was touched on for a bit but was never taken as a direction for the series. The lack of this in what I would call Plot-Driven Story made it seem shallow and the character just seemed to follow the flow without much will of their own. Also, while in the second arc character exploration was ramped up a notch and it also explored the on and off relationship between RL and VR, the objective and mood of the show had then shifted and what would have perfected the show in the beginning didn’t have the intended effect.
But I think there is a reason for all these flaws and it’s the same reason why the series had become so popular. It’s the experience and the setting. The idea of VRMMOG had been explored before in animes and it would be wrong to call it an original idea but I think that they did a good job here with providing a good stage for the adventure to unfold and the idea of living in the game made it more realistic and appealing to people, the classic scenes of a magical world and the atmosphere set by Yuki Kajiura’s scores, which created a fantastical fantasy world atmosphere.
The show also touched on what I would describes as some of the aspects and realities of gaming culture, with the online game economies, PK-ing, escapism and how these things can often act as a reflection upon our modern culture. These things were not a big aspect of the show most people had expected I think and was barely touched upon in favour of adventure stories like, but it was played on elaborately by the show in order to create a some-what realistic online game environment.  Some other aspect such as faction clashes, political scheming and the moral distortions of human behaviours when under the anonymous guise of the internet were given greater insights into and while again it made up an important part of the show, it was barely given any spotlight when compared to the adventures. One thing that maybe bigger than the adventure aspect of the show is the aspect of online relationships and how it reflects on the real world, cited by the KiritoxAsuna relationship which was that feeling is real no matter where they’re, which was also part of what made the relationship seem more real and solid in spite of the seemingly big jumps in character. The relationship aspect again took centre stage in the second arc where the impact of online relationship on RL was explored with Kirito's charge to rescue Asuna in VR who was in coma in RL and his relationship with his imouto/adventure partner in game who have had to resolve their RL emotional and relationship issues through the game. 
Also, as I have read many other reviews before writing my own review, I was surprise as to the low ratings given to the show by many people as I myself thought tat it wasn’t that bad. One point was that the character designs lacked creativity and that often time’s frames were reused again and again, in fight scenes or just in general. While some people say that this was done out of pure laziness of the producer I may offer an alternative reason for this. For the fighting scenes, often times the moves of the characters are pre-programmed so repeats are inevitable. For the repeat of the character designs, again they’re in a game, and like in most online game, the appearances of your avatar may often be similar, programming or just that it’s the habit of the player. Overall I think the character designs were fine.
Overall, if you are looking for something fun to spend your time watching, I would definitely recommend SAO to you. If you are looking for something akin to a masterpiece then you could look harder since this series has many flaws, but I think that the objectives of the producers were different from the viewer’s expectation and if you pay attention enough, you will find what you are looking for in SAO. 
Srry for my long rant and pls look forward to the next review (^)_(^).",7

                I just love this anime.The story of being stuck in a game, needing to survive, haiving a romance even though everything is in a chaos, everything logicaly put great together is just the beggining of describing it.You have battles with swords, great characters, beautiful music,effects and art.Not giving up and getting stronger when you seek to protect someone.Wonderful anime with romance,action,comedy and science fiction...

                Ok so first of all let me start off by saying this is the most over rated anime I have ever seen in my entire life. To everyone thinking about watching it stop at episode 14 trust me if you continue the awesomeness of the first 14 episodes will be ruined for you.
Story 7/10: Some kids get trapped into a video game. It's happened before, it will happen again. The story goes from awesome to pathetic in the second arc, just stop watch because after SAO it gets bad. SAO is amazing though.
Art 9/10: The art is the best part about this anime, it is
                  modern art so it pretty good, good colours used.
Sound 7/10: Sound is alright nothing special.
Character 7/10: Kirito starts off weak in the game but he gets really strong and in my opinon - too strong because in the second series its all too easy for him and its boring watching him chop it all up easily.
I like Asuna because she is not a wussy girl character like a lot of animes she is actually more manly than kirito when it comes to fighting which is good. 
Enjoyment: SAO: 9/10 very good and is very fun to watch them live in a video game. Alfheim online: 5/10 No. boring.
Overall 5/10: Watch it until SAO ends then stop and it's worth the 14 episodes.",5

                I quickly looked over the other reviews for this anime and was shocked, especially with the rating only ranging about half way. I couldn’t let that be and so had to do my own review. I just finished watching this and I thought it amazing. It took me two days and only because I had to go to work. 
The story it really enjoyable, it’s essentially the same idea as Hack but I found the realism of it more believable. It is an idea that has been around for a while but I believe the best stories come from and idea that people recognise but
                  it has a different spin on it to make it almost completely new. 
The story follows the characters as they struggle to survive and try and escape Sword Art Online (SAO). This is only half the show. Half way through they do escape, in a fashion I was very shocked with personally. However not all escape and the main character goes on another adventure in a new game. I will not tell you more on this; it will ruin your surprise.
This is a new anime, only finished in December and it shows with the art. It is clean with smooth but bright colours. The blending and lighting of the art is amazing to look at. I found myself in awe of the colours and also the art style. I loved the style, the way the characters and buildings and EVERYTHING was drawn. I found myself at times in awe of its beauty. It’s a funny thing to say but my favourite part of all the art was the mouth. I have trouble with mouths when I draw, don’t know why, but I loved how they were drawn in this anime. 
The characters I loved. You follow one main character thorough the story called Kirito. You meet quite a few characters along the way as well but unlike other anime’s that have a lot of characters for the viewer to watch and keep track of this one makes sure that you know them by name. You know their personalities and you don’t have to struggle to remember who’s who.  This allows you to get to know the characters so much better.
The characters are believable in their reactions and how they go about this new life. They are characters you learn to love very quickly and if one is put in a dangerous situation you care about what will happen next. I have been shocked and also extremely relived when watching this show. Constantly on the edge of my seat because the characters make you care.
The sound was amazing for this anime as well. The background music always fitted into the show effortlessly and only built upon the situation. It was beautifully composed and I don’t believe the anime could have done without it.
The voice actors fitted their characters as well. I know I have watched anime’s where the voices don’t match the characters and I personally find it very frustrating. This wasn’t the case. 
And off course the opening and ending songs where really fun to listen to as well. I never skipped ahead watching this show. I wanted to see the beginning and listen to the music. It was really good.
I enjoyed this anime so much it is unreal. I don’t watch anime as much anymore because I don’t have as much time and my interest have grown over the years. I haven’t watched an anime this quickly in ages. I didn’t only enjoy watching this anime I loved it. I couldn’t tear my eyes away, and when I couldn’t watch it I was thinking about it. I couldn’t wait to continue the show when getting home. I very rarely get this way with anime but I did with this show and I believe that only indicates how much I enjoyed it. 
Overall I think this is a brilliant anime. 10/10 and I recommend everyone to watch it. I don’t understand the other reviewers scoring for this anime. This is without a doubt one of my favourite anime’s and I really hope you read this review, watch the show and share my view.
Thank you.",10

                I had high hopes for this anime and it didn't disappoint... at first.
I had read the reviews here and after watching the first half, wondered why they were so negative. Up to a point, I rather enjoyed the storyline, the art, everything as a whole.
...Then it reached the halfway point and it just went downhill from there.
The story seemed to lose itself after that and by the end, I found myself crying at the screen that it was absolutely ridiculous and wishing they had just ended it much sooner.

                Sword art online.. Ahhh... Now this is one of the most controversial anime ever created. It practically divided the anime community in to 2 pieces, the one loved it and the other one hated. I am just here to give out my humble opinion and by no means insult the opposite side. So let's get started shall we?
1-Story : So far we are probably all familiar with the setting but i am going to explain it a bit regardless. So in the year 2022 a helmet called ""nervegear"" has been invented that brings the online gaming experience to a new level.  By wearing it
                  you lose control of your body in real life and are able to control your avatar in the game as if it was real life. The creator of nervegear has also launched a new game that was very hyped and 10k players buy it, excited to get in that new world, sword art online. Little do they know however that once you get in there's no way out. No log out option, and instead, the game has to be cleared. The game itself is comprised by 100 floors each with a unique theme and a floor boss that has to be deafeated in order to get to the next level. Also an item has been handed to all the players that make their avatars dissapear, and in their place comes the real life image of the player. However dying in the game means death in real life which is accompliced by a microwave shock to the brain caused by the nervegear. The same applies to people who have their nervegears removed by someone else. 
The concept of being trapped in an mmorpg game was new to me when i watched this show and i was really excited about it since i am a fan of mmorpg. So the story gets a 8/10. There are some flaws (this is where it lost its 2/10) mainly because not much is explained, about the purpose of this game, why it was created.
2-Characters : This is where the sao haters base their arguments, and to be fair, they are not exactly wrong.
Kirito: He is the protagonist, an experienced mmorpg player who is very skilled at games and computers in general. This character is a good fighter and he guarantees a good fight scene when he participates in it. However he is just too perfect. As other people may have stated he seems to be the best at whatever he does, whether that is gaming, programming, girl-attracting etc.. 
Asuna: This the second lead character, a girl who is kinda new to the whole mmorpg thingy but is very skillful nonetheless. Over the course of the first 10 episodes or so she seems strong and ballsy, but later, when romance is introduced to this show, she tends to fall into the stereotypical girl category. Any complaints here are understandable, but i dont see why this is so bad. I enjoy it when a romance ACTUALLY works out in anime ( and believe me, most times they bust your balls before it does) and i really enjoyed it. She wasnt helpless, she actually saved kirito a couple of times as well. Are girly feelings included? Sure yeah, so? I imagine myself in a situation like that and i'd probably be a cry baby at times, and i am a dude. So while i admit asuna's character does have flaws, i dont think the show should be hated because of it.
Sachi, Silica, Liz: Three other girls that meet kirito and he helps them. They end up falling in love with him, making it seem like a typicall harem situation but considering he saved their lives, he is badass, and he rocks at the game, this is the only natural conclusion. 
Suguha: Kirito's cousin who is also in love with him. OK, i see the issue here. It is kinda wrong or weird (whatever you wanna call it..). However! Suguha's character is really tragic and her whole situtation did put a lot of psychological pressure on the viewer. Maybe it's just me, but i tend to get attached to characters, and there was a lot of drama included in this one.
Akihiko kayaba: The creator of the game and the first villain of the show. This is one other major reason why people hate this anime. This dude creates a death game and in the end he forgets why he did it. Sucks, i know, but it didnt bother me too much. What i personally disliked about him is that although he is the reason 4000 people died, and obviously he is a bad person, you couldnt hate him because he helped the main heroes, and he was pretty badass himself.
Sugo/fairy king: This has got to be the worst villain in anime history. Actually he was the perviest and the funniest villain. Ok he was a clown and you couldnt take him seriously. But at times he did make me laugh. I watched the dub, and i also watched the interview of his voice actor, and i liked how he handled him. He is a slimy and weird, and presents his own kind of evil.
Overall the characters had their flaws, so 6/10.
3-Art : The animation and the design of characters is absolutely amazing. The scenery and the backgrounds where beautiful and the bosses where fckin amazing. I really liked it and it gets a 9/10
3-Sound : This is my favourite part. I grew from skipping the opening song to absolutely loving it. Besides the lyrics part, the melody was wonderful, and as for the soundtracks? HA! Yuki Kajiura is the best composer in my opinion and she has never let me down. Each and every soundtrack was wonderful on its own, and even know i have them in my phone and listen to them all the time. I love her style, soothe music into something more aggresive and then vocalists for the climax scenes. Amazing! Superb! 10/10
4-Overall: I have watched tons of anime over the years and i like to think of myself as an experienced anime fan. I tend to be really weird as far as my taste is concerned and the reason why you wont see me hating anime is because i carefully choose them before i start watching them. In my opinion a plot is way more valuable than action. With all this in mind, and the fact that when i watched sao i hadnt watched any similar anime before, i give it a 9/10 ! I understand where the disapointment comes from but i still cant hate it no matter what. The scene where they realize that a log-out button doesnt exist brings chills up my spine no matter how many times i watch this. I respect other people's opinions and in this review i present mine. If you havent watched the anime yet, i'd advise you to do so.",9

                Gamers only. 
Spoilers ahead but who cares it's SAO.
TL;DR: watch Log Horizon instead, even No Game No Life was better than this aids
Let's start with the story (very epic). Kirito basically gets all the girls throughout SAO while cycling through who he should slam next. Sword Art Online, the game not the show, is basically a game in this show that made a bunch of epic gamers gets trapped in the game. The story is pretty awful in that it makes completely no sense. But since anime is already known for having unrealistic physics and stories, the story still makes no sense and won't be
                  given the benefit of the doubt. The story can be split into three parts: 
PPPPPART 1: The main character, Kirito, and about 10,000 other gamers get trapped into Sword Art Online. And if you die in the game, you die in real life. SAO took some inspiration from the Wachowski Sisters but made it a harem-fantasy. Kirito learns about the Sao world, even though he beta-tested for it. Kirito strives to fight people, monsters, and, gain companions. 
PPPPPERFECT Part 2: Kirito picks up chicks and slays pussy and players trying to kill other players.
PPPPUSSY PUNCH Part 3: OH NO Kirito gets married in-game with his Minecraft girlfriend, Asuna and they have a child.
  Kirito and an elite group of gamers take on Dark Souls Boss fights and get loot.
I've left out some details but I rather forget everything about the storyline.
SAO's Art and Sound are mediocre and don't add anything new. The art style is average but I have to say that the first opening was pretty good. The characters are pretty annoying. Kirito is the 'cool' and 'epic' protagonist whereas the other characters make him look even better or are trying to get in his pants. The other characters consist of gamer girls trying to be uwu but don't add any depth to the actual narrative. Characters and character development make movies and shows interesting, especially when done well. Sword Art Online did not have this. The main character stays badass till the end. Minor characters like Klein, a supporting character who deserved more time on screen, are cast away and replaced by other minor characters who will either be deserted or killed off. It is fine to introduce characters for the sole purpose of being killed later in a story. But how Sword Art Online does this is pathetic. This show introduced a character, Sachi, who attempted to make you fall in love with them, then killed them off. When a show does this, it will usually have the character doomed to die, develop and change leaving an impression on the audience, before killing them off. Sword Art Online introduced this character, then killed them within the span of two episodes.
Did I enjoy this show? Well, that is preeettty difficult to explain. I enjoyed this show while watching it, but simultaneously making fun of it and not taking it seriously. I think that this show is funny due to the many dumb moments this anime had. If this anime was ironic I would give it the benefit of the doubt, but seeing as there isn't a ""comedy"" tag, I will have to give this anime a 1. This show is another bad take on the Isekai genre absorbing the attention from other well-written and thought out isekai shows. 
Also Klein is a homeboy but was probably taking Korito's pp hard behind the scenes.
Anyway fuck the police coming straight for kirito because i am 69% sure one of the hoes he smashed was like 12.",1

                This series is ongoing and honestly I wasnt going to rate it until they finished airing but i saw so many bad reviews i thought i should intervene at least for now. i will re-edit my review as more episodes air.
I actually started watching this anime because i absolutely love the manga 1/2 prince and i was looking for another manga like it and heard about SAO. then i found out it had an anime and i was curious. the storyline of SAO and 1/2 prince are very similar and i really love them both!
when i watch anime or read manga im always finding interesting
                  stories with crappy art and crappy characters, or the opposite where the characters and art are great but the story just sucks. especially in shounen anime or any action anime thats aiming for a younger audience(which in my opinion this is, but i like it anyway.)
in SAO, even though its kindof a kids anime, the story and characters are both pretty deep and interesting. you really get into it and want to watch the next episode. they throw in lots of little twists that keep you thinking and for whats its worth i enjoyed it. if your bored this is a great watch!
(please keep in mind that when reviewing this i was also considering the audience that this anime was directed towards-- i rated it accordingly)",9

                THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS
Firstly, I apologise for the strong use of words in this review, but there is no other way to describe this anime. Next, for reviewing purposes, I'll divide this entire anime into 2 parts- the SAO arc and the ALO arc.
From the beginning, this anime has been overhyped, so much that I actually spent my valuable time watching it. Since this was also the first game-based anime I had watched, and since I was a gamer myself, I was curious about how they represent a game in anime terms.
The first SAO arc was quite enjoyable, honestly.  Well, things happened,
                  people got trapped and killed, yada yada; Kirito the OP-est fuck eventually won. The animations were good, sound was okayish, plot was commendable. Though, some of the useless fan-servicing romantic sub-plots in between was total BS. The pacing was decent, though it was a bit slow at times. Still, I'd give this arc a solid 8/10.
Now, the ALO arc. HOLY FUCKING SHIT, WHY THE FUCK WOULD ANYONE MAKE THIS? For some reason, there's this other evil dude who wants to control the world through a game. Yes that's right, a FUCKING game which does not trap people inside and does not kill you if you virtually die (unlike the first arc). And this dude is sick, like necrophiliac sick (well not completely, but close). And for some other frigging reason, there's this useless piece of shit younger sister (not actual siblings, but first cousins nonetheless) who completely falls head over heels for his brother who was in his sleep for 3 years, 3 FRIGGING YEARS! No 'Oniisan, how are you? You've been asleep for 3 years', but straight to 'Hey Oniisan, wanna be the otou-san to my akachan?' I mean, seriously, INCEST in an anime which was turning out to be decent? Just when I thought this anime couldn't get worse, they paced the fuck out of it, faster than Eminem could rap. The plot itself was pathetic and felt rushed. I'd rate this arc in negative numbers if that's possible.
This anime is a big disappointment. It could have turned out to be a decent experience, but ended up disgusting me to the core. And to make matters worse, this has subsequent seasons.
Recommended for viewing? ABSOLUTELY NOT. If given an option to re-watch this anime or sleep with an ape, I'd bang the monkey any day. This is like the Twilight of anime. Please, do me a favour by not watching it.",3

                Sword Art Online is a very overrated anime in my opinon. It is a good anime,but its not number one. A video gamed themed anime is amazing,however,there are so many other ones like No Game no Life,and Log Horizon. So its not like its the one and only game themed anime. Anyways,this is a good series.
Story line-9/10-I will not spoil EVERYTHING,so here's what is going on. Kirito jumps into a online RPG called Sword Art Online. After playing on it for a little while,he and thousands of other players find out when he cannot get out of the game,unless they beat it. If they die
                  in the game,they die in real life. Thats mainly what its about. The story line is unique,and diffrent. This anime really has a good story,but everything changes on episode 14.(im not going to spoil this). 
Characters-8/10-The characters in this anime are,okay. Kirito and Ausna are the ones that got stronger the most. The characters in this anime are kinda annnoying,like that pink-haired girl.(Sorry,I forgot the name). Ausna is the one with the most character development. She was very shy,(explained in the Manga).,and she really turned out to be a really brave character. Kirito also gotten better. The only bad thing I have is,the annoying characters. They get in the way,and its so annoying. Their useless,and it makes it seem Kirito has 4 girlfriends. Oh well,the other character like that red haired freak is funny,and Kirito's sister(later seen).,is a very good character. 
Sound Track-10/10-The sound track in this anime is amazing. Crossing Fields,the first theme song,is beautiful. The music overall is very good. One of the best sound tracks i've ever heard from anime. Sword Art Online has a few flaws,but it doesn't fail with music.
Art-10/10-The art in this anime,beautiful. The colors fit the anime so well. The art for everything is amazing. The best thing about this anime besides the sound track,the art. The art is great for everything. It makes this anime more pretty. The art for the characters are also very good.
Overall-9/10-Sword Art Online gets tens,I think thats a little to high. Sword Art Online  gets a 9,beacuse of good music and art. The story line is good,and the characters are,well pretty good. Its a series thats to over hyped,but still good,",9

                Im going to be real with you. I love the romance in this show especially when ts between the 2 best characters in the series. Kirita is such a cool guy cause unlike me he gets all the babes and that's what i like to see in animes because it pushes me to be more like him. In a way this show inspired me and maybe millions to become better human beings. Kirita is so nice he's too nice, he got so many girls that he could've had them all but instead he chose to only love one. Though this choice is romantic it isn't
                  realistic. The characters were great and the story, sound and enjoyment was fantastic but there is a reason why I only gave this anime an 8. That reason being is because I would've liked to see what Kirita and Asuna did after everything in the real world. I would've liked to see them get married have a baby and buy a house irl because it shows that even though it is a vitural world they are still human and love can be possible even online. 
dm me if you disagree with my review.",8

                If I'm going to talk about this anime I'm going to have to talk about each individual season separately. 
In series one- the premise is fairly simple but in some ways does work. The first series does layout a few ground rules for the MMORPG even if to some point realistically it wouldn't work, but let's just say it would. 
The real weight of the story comes from the consequences that would befall on a player if they achieve a game over- however at no point in the anime does it take the risks and make you feel like any of the main characters are
                  at any peril. Oddly enough I find the main characters to be bland or forgettable- with the exception of the villain- who I gotta say is probably the most interesting character of the bunch. Now while the story on some levels, sometimes works- a lot of it is extremely far-fetched and the fan service for the main character is pretty degrading for actual females that play MMORPG'S- but I'm not gonna moan about that to much because the second series does it a lot worst. 
So what do I like about the first series? The art for one- the animators knew what they were doing with this one and really went the distance with making everything really nice and colorful to truly give you the feeling of actually being placed in a fantasy land. I also liked the designs of the weapons and the expressions and movement on the characters faces are impeccable. 
I also love the music- once again they really went with this one and chose a selection of sounds to really allow the viewer to plunge into the world. 
However if I was just reviewing the first part the art and the sound would of rated higher.
Now let's talk about the second part. And I'm going to just come out and say it- I hate the second part. Okay let's go with it- on a premise that NO way on earth would be allowed to continue- the main character goes back into the virtual world but this time the safety nets on and while some of the characters seemed interesting in the first series, in the second series everyone here is a tool. The plot is essentially the recycled mess of the first series oh no wait- it's completely different because here they have wings.
And while the story was a little bit all over place in the first series- it still knew what direction it was heading. Here- it's a complete mess- you've got so many stories with characters you don't care for and so much fan service that at one point near the end GOES way to far. 
Like I said before- the way women are shown here is INSULTING and degrading. Basically they're there to show uncomfortable touchy moments that would land a guy in jail and fill in the spots of damsel in distress and uncomfortable one-sided love interests.
I can recall little of the music in the second part- because for the most part it's all yapping and 'plot'. And while some of the art is still on par with the first series- I feel disappointed that most of it doesn't let us drink in the atmosphere for that long. With the exception of the end scene which does really well with the lighting- I can't recall many moments that made me go Wow! Like they did in the first series.
For the endings of both- they are both quite rushed. But with the first one series at least it was kinda smart and it was nice for a change that it enforced a kinda good twist. 
If your looking for an anime that looks nice and has a simple plot- then I would definitely recommend watching the first part of Sword Art Online. And for those just wanting to know what happens next- then watch part 2. But for me personality- I'd just stick to series 1 and conclude that series 2 is just a bad ending",6

                Story 7/10
I read the novels of SAO so the story wasnt much of a trouble, but the anime likes to skip some areas of events as a result it felt like the story wasnt constant, so new viewers might get a little confuse. But the story was still enjoyable.
Art 9/10
TBH i cant tell if SAO's art is mediocre or not, but seeing the locations and characters come to life is enough for me. It was very colorful?
Sound 9/10
Depending on where your watching sound quality can differ, but i thought it pretty good. From the clashing of swords to the button noises of the system everything
                  seemed natural even to the sound of the bosses. 
Character 8/10
In SAO you will see a couple of holes in characters. From one episoders to  bipolar actions SAO has them.The main character was probably one of the most well built character in the series but even so his character still had a lot of problems.
Enjoyments 10/10
Even with all its flaws SAO is a pretty enjoyable anime. It can make you smile and can even make you say Awwwww. the story of the SAO anime might have a lot of holes ,but it was still one of those animes from this season you must watch.
Overall 8/10
SAO is a very enjoyable anime from its story to its characters i hope you guys will enjoy it as much as i did.",8
"
                I really like this anime. The type of genre in this show like some romance which people don't want and want more action. I'm somewhat a romance kind of person a bit and don't mind that there's some of this and that. If there was a game like this i would play it as long it doesn't involve a life or death situation. One of the shows worth watching but people have there taste.

"
                I mainly ever use MAL to check for good anime's to watch. I hardly ever write a review. That is how good this anime is.
Story-
The story, although similar to .hack//Sign, is much deeper. It centers around people being mentally trapped in a virtual reality game called, ""Sword Art Online (SAO)."" They are trapped until someone/ some group is able to clear all 100 levels of the game. Generic right? Wrong. It essentially shows the progression of a civilization. How people adapt to the circumstances given, and how problems arise because of it. There is the enveloping problem of escaping from the game, the societal problems
                  that arise between groups, guilds, and general people trying to survive, and there are the emotional dilemma's.
It is these emotional dilemma's that really take this into a whole new level. Since SAO time is relative to game time, is it really worth it to try and escape, or should you start their lives anew? Do you help the masses, or save yourself?  Do you flaunt your power to subjugate people, or do you aim for harmony? There are many, many more emotional problems that the characters have to deal with, and that is what makes this story so great. 
Art-
The art style is amazing. As with a lot of new Anime's the art detail makes it seem like you are somehow watching an HD show.
Sound-
I do not really pay attention to the background music, but it is generally very well choreographed.  
Character-
I am an ardent action anime fan, but I do realize that many action anime's are stagnant. The exhibit few changes. But because of all the problems that arise in this world, you really see a shift in the views of many characters. 
The romance element is great. I do believe that any great anime has to have romance for character development. And this anime does it very well. The chemistry between the titular characters is fantastic. 
Enjoyment-
Action, Adventure, Romance, Intelligence, this anime has it all. 
The story is told through different snippets of the adventure. This way we don't follow the title character through the game, but rather only see the important parts. These parts then join together to form a cohesive puzzle. Much like when you are reading a book and say, ""Oh that is why this part was included!"" This makes the anime really enjoyable. 
Overall this anime is definitely in my top 10. Not the greatest anime ever made, but definitely one of the best in recent years.

"
                I first stumbled upon SAO in 2012 when a friend of my sister recommended it to her, after a few months i found out it became wildly popular. After hearing from another friend i decided to watch it. 
Story 7/10
SAO is a story about a young boy Kirigaya Kazuto being stuck in a MMORPG. While the plot where ""If you die in the game, you die in real life"" was a interesting part in the series, I'd say SAO is more of a romance between kirito and asuna than an action series. The first half was pretty good however, the second half of the series
                  wasn't all that good. So don't expect too much from this series.
Art 8/10 
Art was good, they portrayed the game theme well.
Sound 8/10
The OP and ED was good, the voice acting was fine. This was a good point about the series as well.
Character 6/10
The Characters for me were fine. During the time I was watching this series the only character that has succeeded in catching my eye was yui, other than that the characters didn't really interest me because (1) I couldn't care less about what happens to kirito (to me he's annoying) (2) to me asuna was just another type B tsundere who, in my opinion wasn't interesting enough.(3) the side characters didn't interest me. But the characters weren't really boring, they just failed to interest me.
Enjoyment 7/10
I admit, I was disappointed in this series because I expected too much from it. However, SAO is still a enjoyable series, Its a fun watch.
Overall 8/10
Overall SAO is an enjoyable series, Sadly the romance in SAO failed to reach me, But it is still an enjoyable nonetheless. 
If you are looking for an anime with Game, romance, and adventure, then you might like this series. If you are looking for an action battle anime series then this probably isn't what you're looking for. Again, don't expect too much from this series.",7

                 *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*
ATTENTION: This review will be very long. Actually, it’s over 7200 words long. Therefore I have decided to sum up the arcs in a TL;DR section below the full analysis of both the respective arcs in the story section. This review will also contain HEAVY spoilers for people who haven’t watched the show. So if you’re only here to know if I think you should watch Sword Art Online, then no. I do not think you should watch it. I’d rather suggest that you stay as far away from this show as possible. 
Let’s get
                  on with the review.
""What?! You haven't watched Sword Art Online yet? You seriously need to watch it. It's this amazing story about a guy who gets stuck in a VRMMORPG and if you die in the game you die in real life! Doesn't that sounds freaking awesome dude?! You should know that the second half isn't as good as the first, but it's still awesome!""
The quote above is probably familiar to most people in the anime community as it’s the usual response you’d get whenever you tell people you haven’t watched Sword Art Online. Because of this there’s no wonder why I had sky high expectations for Sword Art Online, but as you can probably tell from the overall score on the right to this review I was nothing short of disappointed. Had my expectations not been so incredibly inflated by all the praise my opinion on Sword Art Online could have, and probably would have, been different. Alas, such is not the case.
As I have different problems with each of the two arcs of Sword Art Online I will be splitting up the story and character sections to deal with the arcs respectively. The sound, art/animation, enjoyment and overall sections will however be including both arcs.
Story: 2 (Appalling)
[Aincrad Arc] (episode 1-14)
The story and core concept of Sword Art Online is well known, as Sword Art Online is admittedly one of the most popular anime in the last ten years. Sword Art Online did a good job drawing me in with its first episode. In fact, I’d easily call the first episode of Sword Art Online the best episode out of both arcs. The first episode did everything a good first episode should do. They introduced our main character, they set the story up in a way which made in clear what was going on and what would be the main goal for our protagonist, Kazuto “Kirito” Kirigaya and Tsuboi “Klein” Ryoutarou, the first supporting character to be introduced. It introduced the Nerve Gear, which is the “Full-dive” headset used to immerse oneself in the game. It didn’t give us any unnecessary information and was very straight to the point, as it set up the rules that would govern their world until the game is cleared. All of these things I liked. The writing in the episode was quite mundane however, especially the dialogue of Kirito. I overlooked this though since I was hoping for it to become better as the show moved on. Overall the first episode managed to make me genuinely interested to see how the rest of Kirito’s adventure would turn out. 
I got so hyped about it, in fact, that I watched the next four episodes purely out of wanting to see where the show would go next. When I, almost two hours later, finished episode five I took a break to really think about what had happened during those four episodes and I realized that the show was already in steep decline compared to the first episode. The second episode had been alright since it had some decent character development with Kirito as we got to see how he dealt with the other players calling him a cheater due to him having played the closed Beta of Sword Art Online before its release. Our second main character was also introduced, Asuna “Asuna” Yuuki, along with one or two minor side characters. The writing in the second episode had neither improved nor declined, which didn’t bode well for the future of the show but I still remained optimistic at this point. What also jarred me in this episode was the fact that a whole month had passed between episode one and two. They hadn’t even cleared the first floor yet and on top of that 2000 people had already been slain in the game. This is told, not shown. Unfortunately, the show does telling but not showing quite a lot.
The third episode did nothing to further the plot and did little to work on character development. Granted, the whole “die in game, die in real life” concept was used quite well in this episode but was quickly brushed under the rug not to be fully touched on again until the 14th episode. We also get yet another time jump of five months and ten floors. Kirito is now level 40. This fact doesn’t say much however since the max level is never declared in the show. All the show wants you to know is that Kirito is a much higher level than the rest of the players.
The following two episodes took a deep dive compared to episode one, two and even three. These episodes once again does nothing to further the plot (Nor do any of the episodes up until the 10th episode.) or characters. We are introduced to more unnecessary side characters, one of them being a loli, because every action pseudo-romance harem needs at least one loli. My enjoyment of show plummeted during these episodes as said loli nearly gets molested by a plant with tentacles. My decrease of enjoyment was also aided by the fact that the dialogue was no longer just mundane, it was now so bad it was almost laughable. 
After coming to this realization I nearly dropped the show, but since I’d pledged that I’d finish the show I forced myself through the next 4 episodes to finally get to the 10th episode, which was the first episode since episode two that wasn’t just another filler.
One thing of note that jarred me was that in the 9th episode Kirito reveals that he has the unique ability to dual wield, an ability that is only granted to the player with the best reflexes in the game. How this is determined is never explained in the show. Kirito tells Klein when pressured to explain his ability that he has had the ability for almost six months and that he didn’t want it to become known as other players might be jealous of this ability. This is not only stupid, but incredibly selfish as people might have lost their life due to Kirito not using his unique ability and possibly slaying a boss quicker than it would have been with him only using a single sword. This has no actual effect on the plot and is just another reason Kirito is far superior to other players.
By the time the 10th episode rolled around an additional 18 months had passed and they had cleared an additional 63 floors since the 3rd episode, putting them on the 74th floor. In the 10th episode Kirito is challenged by Heathcliff to a duel, who is the guild leader of The Knights of the Blood, which is the strongest guild in Sword Art Online. If Heathcliff wins Kirito must join The Knights of Blood and if Kirito wins Asuna will be able to leave her duties in The Knights of the Blood and run away with Kirito. Heathcliff wins and Kirito is forced to join The Knights of the Blood. The whole reason why this episode is at all important to the plot is that Kirito, being the incredibly sore loser he is, suspects Heathcliff of cheating.
Once again, the story is not progressed for multiple episodes until the second half of the episode 13 when all the strongest players of the game are gathered to clear the final boss room of the 74th floor. The party beats the boss but takes heavy losses in doing so. Kirito sees that Heathcliff has only lost about half his HP and lunges at him. Heathcliff doesn’t notice the attack in time however and Kirito’s sword manages to get past his defenses, but doesn’t actually reach Heathcliff himself due to him being an immortal object which is revealed in the same instance. Heathcliff then reveals himself to be Kayaba Akihiko, the creator and lead designer of Sword Art Online and he tells Kirito that he intended to be the final boss of the game on the 100th floor. 
The problem I have with this is that if feels like a cheap way to end the first arc a lot quicker than it could have as the only reason why Heathcliff is revealed to be Kayaba Akihiko is because Kirito is such a terrible looser that the immediately suspected Heathcliff of cheating just for being better than him. The situation is not improved after this however as Heathcliff promises Kirito that if Kirito manages to beat him in a fair fight he’d release all the remaining players still alive in the game and declare the game as “cleared”. Kirito accepts and the fights commences. The fight doesn’t seem to be going in Kirito’s favor and as Kirito is about to lose Asuna saves him by blocking the attack but is killed doing so. Stunned by the death of his loved one Kirito puts up little resistance for Heathcliff and is promptly defeated. Kirito’s body is immediately obliterated in the standard Sword Art Online fashion. Had the show ended at this note I would’ve been pretty happy with the ending, or at least I would’ve gotten the pleasure of knowing that both Kirito and Asuna are dead if nothing else, but unfortunately Kirito is revived purely out of power of will to drive Asuna’s sword through his opponent’s chest, even though her sword is inexplicably still there after its user had been obliterated. By the laws the show has set up until this point the weapons should also be obliterated along with its primary user since we have seen this happen multiple times. This, once again, feel like a cheap way to make the scene more “emotional” as it tries to make it seem that Kirito was only able to win thanks to Asuna. 
Kirito later wakes up in an admittedly beautiful scene (beautiful from an art perspective that is) where he is reunited with Asuna. After talking to each other for a while Kayaba appears and tells them about what is currently going on. He tells them that all the remaining 6147 players were successfully logged out of the game and returned to the real world. Now, remember how many people had been killed in the first month of Sword Art Online? 2000 people had been killed. This means that over the span of the remaining 23 months “only” 1853 additional players were killed. Surely there should’ve been a significantly larger number of casualties over a time span 23 times longer than the first month. Granted the most inexperienced and reckless players would die quickly so it’s no surprise that the first month should have a very high casualty count in total but that only 1853 people died after that seem highly unlikely to me.
Kirito then asks Kayaba why he did everything he did. Why did he spend countless hours on this deathtrap of a game? Could it be the fame he was after? Personal enjoyment? Or was he just completely out of his mind? The answer he gave made me realize how horrendous the writing of the show actually was and how little thought went into creating these characters and writing their dialogue. Kayaba answered with a simple: “I don’t remember”. This pissed me off more than anything the show had pulled so far. More than the fact that the arc is 75% filler, more than the scene where a loli was almost molested by a tentacle plant, hell, it pissed me off more than when Kirito came back to life through the power of being a main character. All the buildup of the show thrown away simply because the writers couldn’t be asked to give Kayaba the least sense of meaning and reason. This scene made me feel as if the writers were trying to paint Kayaba as a morally grey character, meaning that he’s not actually a good nor a bad guy, but fails spectacularly since they can’t even provide a reason why Kayaba did the things he did.
We then get to see Aincrad fall to pieces as we hear Kayaba talking about his childhood dreams. I once again thought that if the show would just fade to black now and end I’d be at least slightly satisfied with the outcome but as I already knew that the show had an additional second arc and a whole other season in the works my hopes of the show having a decent ending were promptly crushed. The episode ends with Kirito waking up in a hospital, feeble and weak, but he still manages to get up and walk out of the room as the end theme plays and credits roll. Here the show breaks more rules, or more importantly it breaks THE rule of Sword Art Online. That if you die in the game you die in real life, and it does so in two main instances. It is explained in one of the shows earlier episode that all the players were disconnected for a couple of hours to be moved to hospitals to be put on life support since players were placed in a state of unconsciousness while playing. The action of disconnecting the players and transporting them to hospitals should have killed them, since it is stated in the first episode that if the Nerve Gear is forcefully removed or disconnected the player will die. Unless Kayaba willingly allowed all players to be disconnected during a certain period of time they shouldn’t be alive according to the rules the show set for itself. It would make sense however is this were to be the case considering that it wouldn’t be very entertaining for Kayaba to see all his subjects die after a couple of days from dehydration, but since it’s never explained or stated in the show I can’t look past it and simply assume that the show writers decided to not tell the audience. 
The other instance the show breaks this rule is a pretty obvious one. When both Kirito and Asuna were killed by Heathcliff but neither of them actually died in real life. I can understand that Kirito was spared due do him dealing the blow which cleared the game and him being spared could’ve been his reward, but unless Kayaba kept Asuna alive for no reason what so ever she should be dead. If there were to be a certain amount of time between dying in the game and dying in real life Asuna surviving could also be possible, but since the show once again didn’t declare that there is a certain time span between dying in the game and in real life I can’t assume that the case would be such.
The show simply ignores its previously set rules and shrugs it off as if it were nothing.
TL;DR [Aincrad arc]
The Aincrad arc of Sword Art Online starts of strong with a good first episode but quickly declines from there with episode 1, 10, half of 13 and 14 being the only episodes which drove the story forward. This means that the whole arc is 75% filler. (14 - 3.5 = 11.5   11.5 / 14 = 0.75 = 75%) The writing is alright at best and laughably terrible at worst. Character development is almost completely left out and most side characters are only seen once or twice and play no role in the plot. The show struggles to tell a coherent and engaging story thanks to the jarring time jumps which riddle the whole arc.  World building is completely missing as by the end of the show you can’t name a single city, town or dungeon as they are never given a name. Most places in the show look either identical or very similar and unoriginal, they are undeniably beautiful however. The show goes back on its promises multiple times in breaking the rules it set for itself. Had the show only been one arc of 14 episodes or if the entire 25 episodes only covered the Aincrad arc and the show had ended with both Kirito and Asuna dying I might not have hated it as much as I did.
[ALfheim arc] (episode 15-25)
Remember the thing most people told me when recommending Sword Art Online to me?
“You should know that the second half isn't as good as the first, but it's still awesome!”
“You should know that the second half isn't as good as the first”
“Second half isn't as good as the first”
“Isn't as good as the first”
“AS THE FIRST”
After finally finishing the first arc of Sword Art Online I had to take a break from Sword Art Online as to not have the pain of watching the first arc fresh in my memory. I dreaded going back to watch the remaining 11 episodes and I wasn’t willing to believe that the second half could possibly be worse than Aincrad had been. Unfortunately for me, I was wrong.
The first episode of the ALfheim arc is the exact opposite of the first episode of the Aincrad arc, as in it’s one of the worst episodes of the whole arc and not the best as the first episode of the Aincrad arc had been. What is to become of the second arc plot-wise is not explained in the first episode but is rather explained in the second episode. Our main “villain” of the arc, Nobuyuki Sugou, is also introduced, more on this creep later. We also get a better look at the new main character of the ALfheim arc, Suguha Kirigaya, who we are told in the beginning of the episode is Kirito’s adoptive sister but is later in the episode revealed to actually be his cousin. She ends up adding nothing to the plot however as she provides nothing more than fan service.
In the episode we find out that two months has passed since Sword Art Online was cleared, but 300 people still haven’t woken up yet. Asuna is one of these 300. Kirito visits her frequently in the hospital, where one day he meets both Asuna’s father and a man named Nobuyuki Sugou. They talk for a while and Asuna’s father leaves, which leaves Kirito and Nobuyuki alone with Asuna. Nobuyuki is quickly painted up as the bad guy of this arc as he, immediately as Asuna’s father leaves, starts acting like a sleazy creep as he strokes Asuna’s face and sniffs her hair. He then tells Kirito that he is to wed Asuna in one week, even if she is yet to wake up by then. We, along with Kirito, are informed that after the company called Argus, the developer studio behind Sword Art Online, was run into the ground by debt the maintenance of the Sword Art Online servers was entrusted to Asuna’s father’s company, RCT. Nobuyuki tells Kirito that he is the “director if RCT’s Full-Dive research department.” and he says this means that basically “deserve” to marry Asuna since she’s essentially dependent of him for sustenance. This all makes it very obvious that the writers didn’t even try to hide the fact that his is going to be the main antagonist in the ALfheim arc, compared to the first arc where they at least tried to make Kayaba a more or less neutral character. Kirito goes home saddened by the conversation with Nobuyuki. The next day Kirito receives an E-mail from Agil, who was his close friend in Sword Art Online but as he didn’t add anything to the plot I didn’t bother mentioning him, with a screenshot of an avatar resembling Asuna from within another game. As I already said, this episode is one of the worst in the whole arc as the dialogue between Kirito and his cousin Suguha is cringe worthy at best since we get to know that Suguha has feelings for Kirito. Yes, you read right. She knows she’s his cousin and she loves him. The show went there. I could hardly believe it myself. The show has actually stooped that low.
The next episode starts off with Kirito visiting Agil to talk about the screenshot. Kirito finds out that the screenshot comes from a game called “ALfheim Online”, which is another VRMMORPG very similar to Sword Art Online and that the screenshot was taken at the top of the biggest tree in the game, called the “World Tree” and to get to the top you must beat the final boss of the game. ALfheim Online was released one year after the Sword Art Online incident and is based on the same structure as Sword Art Online, The Cardinal System. The game is revealed to be owned by RCT Progress, Asuna’s father’s company. This only further enforces the obviousness that Nobuyuki is behind the 300 people, including Asuna, who haven’t woken up yet from Sword Art Online. Why anyone would ever buy and play a VRMMORPG after Sword Art Online or why these kinds of games are still legal is never explained. 
To save Asuna from Nobuyuki Kirito goes into ALfheim Online where he meets Leafa who promises him to help find Asuna. I was unhappily unsurprised when Leafa is revealed to be his cousin. This reveal made me very reluctant to continue to watch the rest of the show. Why it did so was because the interactions between Kirito and Suguha are by far the worst written and directed scenes of the whole show, so to have the whole arc filled with dialogue between them would be insufferable. To avoid having to re-build the strength Kirito possessed in Sword Art Online it’s half assedly explained that Kirito regains all his previous power simply because ALfheim Online is based in the Cardinal System which Sword Art Online was based on. How this makes any sense what so ever is never explained.
In the 3rd episode of the ALfheim arc, or the 17th episode of the show it is revealed to us in a scene atop the World Tree that Asuna is being held prisoner by Nobuyuki who goes by the name “Fairy King Oberon” which is by far the most ridiculous villain name I’ve ever heard. He himself is almost as ridiculous a villain as his name would suggest as in the same scene tells Asuna how he would enjoy “taking her by force”, a.k.a raping her. He then, purely out of convenience for the viewer, reveals how he managed to trap all 300 players in ALfheim Online after they were released from Sword Art Online. Whether the 300 players, with the exception of Asuna, are actually players within the game or just stored on a server is never explained. Keeping them active in the game would be a dumb thing to do as the 300 players could tell other normal players in ALfheim Online the truth, and that’s exactly what I’ll assume the show did since it’s the worst of the two decisions. As he was giving this explanation I couldn’t help but to laugh at how forced the whole concept of the ALfheim suddenly felt. This is the direct quote for Nobuyuki himself: “It wasn’t hard to use a router to capture a portion of the players as they were being freed from the game.” It doesn’t take a degree in computer science to understand that this wouldn’t work. The only way I can think of that would make such an absurd feat possible were if whilst the players were locked within Sword Art Online their minds were stored on the servers which RCT Progress took over when Argus went down, but since this isn’t possible nor logical I will keep calling it a forced explanation given by the writers to force the “plot” of the show forward, instead of ending it right after the first 14 episodes. Nobuyuki then tells Asuna why he captured the 300 players within ALfheim Online and what he plans to do with them. He says that through months of hard research, he and a small team of scientists have figured out a way to inject new information into human memories which will allow them to change the emotions related to said memories, and that memories might be able to be completely altered, created or removed. I have to give the show credit where it’s due though. The whole concept of removing, creating and altering memories is not completely ridiculous as such science is being worked on today and as the show is set in 2024 them being that close to such technology is not out of the question. To be telling all of this to Asuna is quite idiotic on Nobuyuki’s part as if Asuna manages to escape and tell her father about what Nobuyuki is doing behind her father’s back he’ll most likely be thrown in jail. The show also deserves some credit for realizing that having an antagonist without any sole purpose, (ahem, Kayaba) is worse than having an antagonist with a ridiculous one.
The show then curls up in a ball while suckling on its thumb like the child it can be compared to as it spends the next six episodes on filler side-stories, cringe worthy drama and character interactions and petty attempts at making the viewer care for Suguha’s feelings towards Kirito. Most scenes in these episodes are so insignificant and useless to any kind of character development or furthering the plot that they aren’t even worth mentioning, all except for two. These two scenes I will talk about briefly, not because they’re well made, not because they’re important and not because they invoked any kind of emotion. I will talk about them because they’re so horribly bad that I didn’t believe my eyes as they unfolded before me.
The first of the two scenes take place in episode 21. In this scene Asuna escapes her imprisonment and goes searching for a way either out of the game or off the World Tree. Here is my first problem with this scene. As she escapes and goes searching for a way out she walks along the branches of the tree while she could just jump right off the branch right down to the ground. She’s a damn fairy. She has wings. She can fly. This stupidity just shows how little thought is put into the scenes. Asuna then comes across a room filled with terminals displaying holograms resembling brains above them. She quickly figures out that these are the minds of the 300 players which are all being experimented on. Why these are even inside the game is never explained, as I’m fairly certain that it would be significantly easier to just experiment on them in the real world and not within a VRMMORPG. As she continues to search for a way out she gets caught by two purple tentacle monsters who start touching her quite inappropriately. What these monsters are exactly is not explained. If they were players shouldn’t they look like all the other players and not like tentacle monsters? My guess is that they’re only there for the purpose of molesting Asuna. Doing this, the show just reduced its main female lead to nothing but a bag of meat to be sexually exploited by the show to cram as much fan service out of each episode as possible. She is then returned to her cage in the tree, which concludes the scene. We learnt nothing during this scene that we didn’t already know which shows that she show writers are now completely desperate after things to fill this burning pile of garbage up with.
The second scene takes place at the bottom of the World Tree between Suguha and Kirito. In this scene Kirito tells Suguha, a.k.a Leafa, that the reason he wants to get to the top of the World Tree is to save Asuna just after Suguha tries to tell Kirito that she loves him. Suguha is shocked by this however as she now figures out that the guy who calls himself Kirito within the game is actually her cousin who she loves in the real world, Kazuto Kirigaya. I honestly found it baffling that the writers actually expect the viewers to believe that Kirito and Suguha haven’t talked about what they’re doing within the game at least once while conversing in real life, or that Kirito hasn’t told Suguha in the game why they’re even going to the World Tree to begin with or that Suguha hasn’t realized that Kirito in the game is Kazuto Kirigaya in real life as they look and sound exactly the same.
I just wanted to get my problems with those scenes of my chest. Now back to some actual “plot” progression. Episode 24 starts off with Kirito reaching the top of the World Tree and is reunited with Asuna, but Nobuyuki catches them and locks them both in place with his administrative powers. After monologuing for some time Nobuyuki chains Asuna up to the roof by her wrists, making her unable to cover herself at all as he starts off by sniffing her hair and rubbing up against her. Once again the show reduces her no nothing more than a bag of sexualized meat. When Kirito then begs Nobuyuki to stop he gets mad and drives Kirito’s sword through his back while he’s still unable to move. We then get shown that Nobuyuki can control something called “Pain absorber” for each individual player. This feels like something that was thrown into the scene at a whim because they realized that you can’t really torture someone in a game where they can’t feel pain. He turns down Kirito’s Pain Absorber Level from 10 to 8. Exactly how much pain you’re susceptible to at the different levels is not declared so it becomes hard to relate to the agony he has put Kirito in.  Nobuyuki also says that at level 3 it’ll start to affect his real body. You’d guess that after what happened with Sword Art Online VRMMORPG’s shouldn’t even be legal anymore, or that there should be serious regulations put on them so I find it highly illogical that such a thing as a Pain Absorber Level would even be allowed to exist within the game. Nobuyuki then goes back to Asuna to rip her top off. He then tells her how he’ll first rape her in the game and then go to her hospital room in real life to rape her there once again. I feel like this is only done to ensure that every single person watching hates Nobuyuki’s guts so that when Kirito eventually beats him people will view Kirito as more of a hero. Also, who the hell decided to program in the function to RAPE within the game? It's like the show forgets that it takes place in a videogame which should have some restrictions to it.
We then see Kirito surrounded by a white light, monologuing about how he’s actually useless and weak. And like clockwork we get the obligatory deus ex machina moment every really bad show must have at some point, since the writers aren’t creative enough or have written themselves into a corner. Out of nowhere, Kayaba Akihiko appears to grant him higher authority than that of Nobuyuki. With these powers, Kirito removes all authority Nobuyuki had, effectively rendering him useless. He then reduces Nobuyuki’s pain absorber lever to 0, even though he knew that at level 3 your real life body might be affected which makes Kirito no better than Nobuyuki, if not worse as he holds no regard for his life. Kirito also tells Nobuyuki not to run, since Kayaba Akihiko hadn’t run no matter the situation. Through this the show actually tries to make the audience like Kayaba, even though he killed nearly 4000 people. Why the show is even trying is beyond me.
After slicing, stabbing and dismembering Nobuyuki multiple times with his pain absorber set to 0, he finally manages to save Asuna. Asuna then returns to the real world for the first time since before Sword Art Online while Kirito stays behind to talk to the ghost of Kayaba. The thought of Kayaba’s consciousness somehow remaining within the source code of the game is completely ridiculous. Unless somehow programmed in himself into the Cardinal System before releasing Sword Art Online this would be completely impossible, since ALfheim Online only used the same engine as Sword Art Online and didn’t completely remake Sword Art Online itself into a new game. Even if he did program in his consciousness into the Cardinal System, that consciousness shouldn’t retain any memories gained by Kayaba in Sword Art Online, and shouldn’t remember who Kirito is since it should be a version of Kayaba from before Sword Art Online. Kayaba gives Kirito “The Seed”, which is the program used to simulate Full-Dive VRMMO environments and tells him that he can do whatever he wants with it. What he does with it is revealed in the next episode and is the idiotic decision I’ve ever seen Kirito make. 
The next episode starts off with Kirito rushing to the hospital to meet with Asuna who has finally woken up. When he reaches the parking lot of the hospital Nobuyuki gets the jump on him, cutting his arm open with a knife and he falls over. Nobuyuki then starts kicking him while he’s lying on the ground, telling him to get up. He takes a stab at Kirito but misses due to “his glasses fogging up”. This is possibly the most retarded instance of plot armor I’ve ever seen in anime. Kirito then manages to overpower Nobuyuki with a single hand, takes his knife and tries to slit his throat. He lacks the guts to do it however and leaves Nobuyuki crying on the ground. The rest of the episode is mostly filler, but we do get to know that ALfheim Online is forced to shut down after both Asuna and Kirito tells the authorities what had been going on in the game. The fact that it took two VRMMORPG incidents to place a ban on such games is astounding. Remember what Kayaba had given Kirito in the previous episode? Remember that I said that I found his decision to be completely and utterly idiotic? He uploads The Seed to the internet so that anybody and their grandmother can make their own VRMMORPG granted they have the server to handle it. This is beyond retarded. Beyond crazy. Beyond idiotic. I can’t describe with words how much I abhor Kirito at this point. After all he’s been through you’d think that he’d never want anybody else to suffer the same, but by doing this he has guaranteed that such event will occur multiple times over and over and over.
To be completely honest, I never expected to hate the ALfheim arc as much as I did and I sure didn’t expect it to be worse than the Aincrad arc, but I was so very wrong…
TL;DR [ALfheim arc]
There isn’t much to summarize about these dreadful 11 episodes. The ALfheim arc did nothing right and almost everything wrong. It reduces its main female character to nothing but an object to be oversexualized. The new female character which is introduced is only there to be an incredibly awkward love interest for Kirito. There are no significant side characters. It leaves much to be desired in terms of character development and world building just as the Aincrad arc had. This arc has about the same amount of filler, though it’s harder to calculate since the plot is not as concentrated as it had been in the Aincrad arc. The antagonist is horrible, and is arguably worse than Kayaba had been. This arc had literally no redeeming factors.
Characters: 2 (Appalling)
[Aincrad arc]
Kazuto “Kirito” Kirigaya. 
There isn’t much to say about Kirito other than what I have said already, and as you can tell I haven’t gone very deep into Kirito’s personality but only the show can be blamed for that. Kirito is essentially an empty shell of a person. He rarely shows any kind of believable emotions and is never able to make me care what so ever about what happens to him.
He is outrageously OP however, as he can far out level everybody while playing solo which anyone who has ever played an MMO can tell you is complete and utter bullshit, he can take on a group of up to 10 people at once without breaking a sweat, he is also rewarded the ability to be able to dual wield which is a unique ability that only the player with the best reflexes can use and this only makes him even more ridiculously OP, he can hack the game from within the game itself to turn a stupidly advanced AI into an object in the game in just a few seconds, he defies the hard written code of the game to come back to life by the power of boner to kill Heathcliff, he manages to get every girl he meets to like him even though he's an asshole because the show is actually just another terrible romance harem that happens to be set in a VRMMORPG. 
He’s a wish-fulfillment character in every sense of the word.
Asuna “Asuna” Yuuki
Asuna is honestly far better than Kirito in terms of showing human emotion as there are some scenes where I actually care about her, but when I say “some” I really mean 1 out of 10 at most. 
She is introduced in the second episode as a badass who could possibly even be better than Kirito, but after a few episode she is completely stuck in the “Kirito-kun” harem and manages to do nothing at all on her own.
Yui 
A minor character who is so unimportant that I didn’t even bother mentioning her. She is beyond annoying and is only there to explain very obvious thing to the audience and to be used as a deus ex machina plot device for the main characters to proceed with the paper thin plot.
Kayaba “Heathcliff” Akihiko
The main villain of the Aincrad arc. There, once again, isn’t much to say about the mastermind behind Sword Art Online in terms of personality as the show doesn’t give him one. He does have more impact in the plot than any other character in the show with the exception of Kirito.
The writers tried to make a morally grey character with Kayaba but failed miserably.
There are also plenty of minor supporting characters in the Aincrad arc, but they’re all so insignificant that I can’t even take the time to talk about them.
[ALfheim arc]
Kazuto “Kirito” Kirigaya.
There really isn’t a difference between the Kirito we see in the Aincrad arc and the Kirito we see in the ALfheim arc. He’s just as empty as before, if not more of an idiot in this arc. 
Asuna “Asuna” Yuuki
Asuna is basically reduced to nothing in this arc as she is locked up from the get go and isn’t released until the last episode. She’s a damsel in distress who is only used for far service from time to time.
Suguha “Leafa” Kirigaya
Suguha is the main love interest for Kirito in this arc. Suguha is also his cousin. See the problem? Had she not been related to Kirito in any way I wouldn’t have a problem with this, but since they are I have serious trouble fathoming who thought that making them cousins was a good idea. She doesn’t really provide any actual plot progression and the slight personality she has is completely overshadowed by her feelings for Kirito. Every single one of her lines of dialogue are either directed at Kirito or are about him. 
Nobuyuki “Fairy king Oberon” Sugou
I’ve never seen writers try to make the audience hate a single character so much as they tried to make you hate Nobuyuki, and honestly, they didn’t do a very good job at it. Repeating the same threat over and over again without actually doing anything quickly makes those same threats lose their potency. Just like all the other characters in the show, he completely lacks a personality with any particular traits other than being a creepy asshole. 
Yui 
Yui hasn’t changed much since the first arc. She’s still only there to be convenient to the audience and Kirito to explain what is going on. She is way more annoying in this arc however, since she now almost completely resembles Navi from Legend of Zelda.
Art: 7 (Good)
I remember how people would tell me Sword Art Online had amazing animation and art, especially in the fights but there isn’t much there to praise. Sure, some of the environments look stunning and some fight scenes are fluid and well-choreographed but everything about the animation screams unoriginality. It’s as if there is a very specific way a character, place and fight can look in these kinds of action harem light-novel adaptions which makes most of them look very unoriginal. Also,the show uses an abundance of still frames, even in fights which is incredibly jarring. 
Sound: 8 (Great) 
What’s there to say about the sound quality, sound track and voice acting except that it’s absolutely phenomenal? It’s the best part of Sword Art Online by miles and miles. The sound track is beautiful and varied enough not to get repetitive. The sound quality of bare feet on a wooden floor, the clashing of swords as well as something as simple as someone talking off their VR helmet, it all sounds absolutely fantastic and I have to give mad props to whoever is responsible for this. The voice acting is also top-notch. It really is too bad that the characters never said anything at all meaningful.
Enjoyment: 1 (Abhorrent) 
I personally didn’t enjoy anything about Sword Art Online, except for the sound and certain scenes in terms of animation. This, unfortunately, didn’t cover up the tremendous amount horrible character interactions, poorly executed plot points and completely unnecessary filler episodes. It will honestly be hard to find an anime which I will dislike more than I disliked Sword Art Online.
Overall: 3 (Terrible)
Sword Art Online is nothing but a pseudo-romance harem which happens to be set inside two VRMMORPGs. Characters completely lack any personality, there are way more episodes of pure filler than ones that actually drive the insanely thin plot forward, both antagonists of the show are on opposite sides of the spectrum but both are so far on either side that it becomes extreme which completely ruin anything they might have had going for them. Additionally, Kirito seems to be so incredibly dense that anything and everything revolves around him, including the show and all side characters.",3
"
                This show is awful ! Everything is a horrible. I had waste time of watch this show. I have say you why this is horrible. I have massive problem with this show. Characters is very important to me. SAO characters is so boring and dull. No one is interesting character. I not know why all of girls chased to Kirto ! It's really annoying to me. Story is horrible. First episode is really good start but goes downhill. I think 2-15 episodes is really boring. I really think they should more focus on story and characters. 16-25 episodes is sightly improvement but still horrible. Villains
                  is very disappointed ! I thought they are powerful but they are a cheater and weaker ! 
Animation and fight is a good. I guess it is only positive for show. 
3/10",3
"
                So here's the good news: the production value for SAO was quite amazing. ""Scenery porn"" is a great descriptor for it, especially during the first cour, covering the namesake world itself. It matches hand-in-hand with the level of narrative depth of the world too - while there are problems aplenty with the structural integrity of the setting, it doesn't necessarily take away from the immersion. The core concept alone is compelling.
But, like I said, that's the good news. The obvious implication is that this'd be the high point, and everything else suffers in comparison. Quite frankly, the A-1 writing staff did a poor job with
                  this series, mishandling pretty much every opportunity for dramatic tension. Most of the time, it isn't that big a deal - a false note here, a second too long or short there - but the cumulative result is a story badly told.
Controversially, I think the ALO arc actually handled it better than the SAO arc, at least initially. It sacrifices a lot of the momentum put forth by the first cour's action focus in favor of a character study on the relational aftermaths of the SAO incident, which is exactly the thing to do after having a nation-impacting incident. But, even here, it got muddled halfway through - and it certainly doesn't help that they deflated all possible tension and sense of risk by focusing on how much ass Kirito kicks instead.
TL;DR: compelling setting, wasted narrative opportunities.",7
"
                I don’t care about all the hate this anime is getting. Personally, I loved it and I belive it is worth being on everyone's list.
Sword Art Online is a beautiful love story, with gorgeous animation and interesting set-up. 
The World it created really stimulated my imaginary and I often found myself wishing that such game was possible. 
I would perhaps mention that the second part of the first season is not really good. I suggest stoping at episode 14 and imagining the rest of the story for yourself.
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE DISAGREEING THAT ITS NOT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY:
guys it's my opinion... In my eyes
                  it was beautiful...",9
"
                When you have a series like Sword Art online, you'll usually have two and a half camps: lots of people who like it, lots of people who don't, and a small group that fall in the middle. I fall pretty much in the third camp. 
SAO is a cool, though not wholly original, concept. The whole 'trapped in a video game' opens up a lot of avenues for the creators to take, even more-so in SAO because it's set in the future. Basically, the creators had an open canvas and could have made something great.  How did it turn out?
Ehhh....just above average? 
Lemme explain.
First,
                  I'll say what was good. The art and music were wonderful. Not the best I've ever seen, but they were certainly great. I'll even include the action scenes in this as well. The fights were (usually) exciting and fun, something you should expect out of a video game anime. 
As for the other important stuff....
The story was okay at best. It overstayed its welcome. I felt it lasted about twice as long as it needed to. It just seemed to feel stretched after the first half. I won't say why exactly, but if you watch SAO, you may see what I am talking about. Also, the plot seems to shift from a story that could have been very cool and deep, to one that is very average and a little disappointing. 
Also the pacing seems weird. The entire SAO experience is done more or less in time skips between episodes. Toward the end this changes, but it just felt like a lot was missed because the writers wanted to move the story along. I think the characters and the plot suffered because of this. I'm not saying that time skips can't be done, but here they just feel jerky and awkward. 
Now for the part that disappointed me the most: the characters. Every aspect of the plot could have been forgiven if not for the poor character choices. I say 'choices' because all of the characters and their characteristics are not bad. Some are wonderful! Unfortunately this show seems to waste them. 
Before I go on, I will call the characters by the names used most in the show. Some have screen names that are different from their real life names so I just wanted to clarify. 
Let's start with the hero. Kirito is probably one of the worst hero characters I have watched in a while. He's boring, his character seems to change at the strangest of times for convenience, and he has the same problem that Superman does: he's as powerful as he wants to be because he's the hero...and that's the reason. I can't say anything too in depth unfortunately, because I don't want to venture into spoiler territory. 
Basically though, he's not just the hero character. He's the one-dimensional hero character. Sure he's got some flaws, but those seem to disappear pretty quickly once they become inconvenient...which is the exact opposite thing flaws should do. He just seems to always be able to overcome everything, despite everything saying he shouldn't, which could seem commendable, but here it is just illogical and annoying. I found myself saying 'but you (the writers) said no one could do that and now it's ok!?' He seems to be pretty much perfect throughout most of the show, and that doesn’t make for an interesting character to watch. 
This is probably more of a mix of the character and the plot, but he seems to benefit from it the most so I'm putting it on him.
Asuna is the second lead in this show. She is one of the wasted potentials of this show. Early on, she is awesome (and she doesn't need to have convenient plot twists to be that way). She's independent, she can fight extremely well, and she is really fun to watch. I honestly wished she would've been the main hero of this story instead of Kirito. After a while though, this character seems to get less and less interesting, and eventually she becomes little more than a plot device. It's horribly unfortunate. 
The supporting cast is...well...not good. One is a girl named Yui and the other Suguha. True, there are more side characters (getting to them in a sec), but they barely have enough screen time to be called ‘supporting characters’. These two are probably the next most seen characters aside from the main characters...and how unfortunate is that? Both just drove me nuts for some reason. Whenever they were on the screen I just felt like my time was wasted. If it wasn't 'being cute'(and not much else) for one, it was fan service (and not much else as well) for the other. The 'not much else' seems to be to drive the story-line into unnecessary and very uninteresting tangents. A good chunk of the audience's time is wasted with these two, which isn’t the point of supporting characters. They are meant to support the plot, not be the main focus of it. 
Why do I not like these characters so much? Mostly for the reason above, but also; they took time away from the other side characters. 
There are a lot of characters who are in about one or two episodes, while some are in just a few more than that. Some are really just side characters. Others seem like they should have been more prevalent and even upgraded to the sorely lacking supporting cast. The two who should have been upgraded are Klein and Agil. These two are just below the line of support characters. They have a lot of screen time compared to the other side characters, and are quite honestly are much more interesting than the actual support characters. However, as with Asuna, they are merely wasted potential. 
The rest of the side cast is mostly one-episode characters, which isn't unusual in anime, but they are very forgettable. I barely remember what they did and couldn't even guess at their names. The worst part is that they are all females. 
Which brings me to my main problem with the characters of this show; I honestly don't think the writers know how to write good female. Asuna is literally the only female who has any personality at all at that goes away as soon as it starts to outshine the great, mighty, and horribly uninteresting Kirito. This seems to be a problem in some anime, but here it just is glaringly problematic. Every female is either here as fan service, as a villain, or just as episode filler. It's kind of sad and I hope in the SAOII this is fixed. 
I like a good strong male protagonist as much as the next guy, but I can also love when a female dominates the spotlight. None dominate so much as a candle in this show. 
That's it! 
'Wait...what about the villain?’ you must be asking. 
....Fine....
The villains throughout the show have little more use than to be something for the hero to fight. I'm not even saying fighting their philosophies (or lack thereof in this show) or even to try to turn them good. They are literally there just for the hero to beat up and really nothing more substantial than that. I am a guy who really enjoys watching villains usually, but these just were bad at being the bad guys. 
Alright, time to wrap this up. 
I know I mostly looked at the bad of this show. Is it terrible? No. Is it amazing? No. Is it average? Eeeeeehhhhhhhhh....just above. I really mean JUST above. The art, music, and action are enough to make me recommend the show, but it wouldn't be a shame if you missed it either.  
Thank you for reading!",6

                BEFORE THE REVIEW
Let me just say that 5 is AVERAGE. 
Don't flame me for it because 5 is actually AVERAGE this means it's a generic 
anime among anime. Sword Art Online is not bad but it is also not great so with
that let's get the review started.
STORY: 5 - separated into 2 views from people I have heard from
1).""MMO battles! Action oriented view some sad stories along the way""
    People that like Sword Art Online story should realize that it's basically Fan Fiction.
 I have seen stories better than it on the internet on blogs and forums and yes these were older than Sword Art Online. You hear good things about Sword Art Online's story but hate 'generic' shounen titles such as Naruto, One Piece, Bleach? well tough luck this show is the same format only the arcs are worse.
MMO battles? let's just solo bosses then. BAD (and I mean BAD in the writing department) villains. Sad stories that  make me laugh. Characters that are more interesting than the main ones are forgotten without development and then they die how am I supposed to be sad for that? The main guy also forgets them and does not care after the whole ""When we die here we die in real life"" thing is stupid since the main guy will NEVER I repeat NEVER I'll say it again HE WILL NEVER LOSE and that's his character. Unbeatable guy the author wants to be because that is what Fan Fiction stories are about.
2.)""You should watch it for comedy, harem and romance""
   While this is view looks so retarded he actually does get a Harem because he's such a sex magnet every girl 15km radius goes to him. The powerful girl also STAYS IN THE KITCHEN I feel the author has some underlying deep message there for every feminist out there. 
If it's supposed to be like this get a sense of humor or watch actual shows that are in that genre. If you get laughs from Sword Art Online and feel that ""Romance"" (ahaha they should remove that Tag and replace it with ""everyone loves the main guy for no apparent reason"") please watch actual RomComs. If anything main guy crying is pretty funny.
ART: 7
Pretty good not much to say generic anime art and animation.
SOUND: 8
Very good Sound Track.
CHARACTERS: 3
I will not bash characters for their poor writing but they have no depth and stupidly small developments. The interesting ones are forgotten and we are left with KITCHEN GIRL and MAIN GUY.
If I cannot remember their names or character feats from them that means its a forgettable character.
+1 for sister though though that minor incest stuff sucked her character itself does not belong in Sword Art Online.
Enjoyment: 4
It's watchable but these types of stories are not enjoyable for me its actually (1) now simply because I was forced to watch it twice
(You know that tie you up to a chair watch something you hate thing. I never expected that to happen to me but it did plus they replaced the soundtrack with Taylor Swift music. Wow yes it happens in real life.)
Fan Fiction turned anime pretty much.
OVERALL: 5
If you rode the hype and watched 2 episodes that are actually GREAT and gave Sword Art Online a 10 please reevaluate your score properly because I think we all know that it's not a Masterpiece.
Thanks for Reading.",5
"
                Just downright terrible. Terrible execution, terrible characters, terrible storyline, terrible villains, terrible development. An abomination. Alright, art and music were good but nothing too special about them. Want to watch a real action anime? Go ahead and watch Code Geass, Evangelion, Gurren Lagann, etc. 
Seriously, I have no idea this anime became so sensational. It evokes feeling? They are temporary pathos try to engage viewers to make them feel ""empathy,"" which has a bad tendency to make them feel ""apathy."" Characters are awesome? Ladies and gentlemen, there's a significant difference between popular character and good character. Let's take Shinji Ikari and Kirito for example. Obviously
                  Kirito will be more popular because he is a badass, pussy magnet, and Jesus. Does that make him a good character? ABSOLUTELY NOT. In fact, he is one of the blandest, boring character I've ever met. What about Shinji? Shinji is a wimp, a crybaby so no one likes him? WRONG. In fact, he is one of the greatest anime character made in the history of anime(IGN.) 
Let me get to my point. This anime can be fun, but it's an abomination.",2
"
                SAO, one of the most hated anime of all time( even though it not the worst) and one of the loved franchise who saw this anime as a gateway to whole different anime. In the nutshell, there are no middle-ground on this biopolar show. 
Now on to my review,
SAO was my first major anime I watch(by myself), after my sister introduce me into watching Re:zero and this lead to spark of interest in anime. Ever since I watch Re:zero, I watch anime around that time such as Kabaneri of the Iron fortress being my first anime. SAO didn't got me interest because of the hate
                  train that still continue to these day. Out of the blue, I decide to watch it and I got to say, it was very emotional ride. The romance between Kirito and Asuna was very beautiful and the final fight on floor 74 got me tense up. I know that people didn't like the time-skip and the harem element . This cause people to drop the  show because of it losing the reasoning behind the titles ""SAO"" and not expecting another game. Plot hole was another factor that people complain about, and I completely agree with them because the anime didn't give the source material justice and not including monologue for Kirito and Asuna. I personally feel that the director hate both of the character and not adding it, cause in the source material it shape them into what they are. They also butcher the murder arc in episode 5-6, in the source material it show that Kirito and Asuna was both equal and not showing Kirito smartness. The harem didn't bother me, because they got over it.
If I was to give one criticism, it was be showing off more game element. 
I know that SAO is not a perfect anime and not either cancer that people might say.
Music: 10/10 by the goddess herself, Yuki Kajiura. Swordland is my personal favorite cause of the sheer epicness at the end and Asuna theme ""Luminous Sword""",9

                Story: 9
The story starts in year 2022 when a new virtual game (VRMMORPG) is released and everyone is just starting out. All the players get trapped in the game, and the only way out is to defeat the game. If a player dies in the game then they also die in real life. The two main heros of the story, Kirito and Asuna, are two of the many who are trying to beat the game so the remaining players can make it out.

I loved the animation! I think the characters were drawn out very well, as was the scenery and the monsters that had
                  to be fought.
Sound: 10
The opening and ending songs were great. My favorite was ""Crossing field"" it made for a really great opening song. The voices for the characters suited the characters well. I think the japanese version is better than the english dubbed in all honesty though.
Character: 10
Kirito, the main hero is a solo player who, at first, didn't rely on anyone else. As the story goes on he learns that he can't do everything himself and that having others around makes things a lot easier. He also falls in love with the main heroin Asuna. At first all she cared about was beating the game so she can get back to real life. To her ""another day in the virtual world was one lost in real life"" But with the help of Kirito she realized that a day that goes by still counts whether it's in real life or not.
Enjoyment: 10
I found the plot and characters to be amazing. I enjoyed watching the characters grow and develop over time and the anime had me addicted from the  start. 
Overall: 10
The anime was amazing. I can honestly say that I enjoyed every minute of it. I recommend this to those who likes gaming, adventure and romance animes. This would definitely be a good anime for you to check out!",10

                honestly i found the anime to be kind of slow and as it only had 1 episode i went to read the light novel. Sadly though after i found a site to read it, it turns out the novel was still pretty slow. I had to skip to around chapter 16 in the novel before there was any new content, although i had read the manga too which is farther than the anime. I really enjoyed the story though and was actually sad when it was over, or atleast when the aincrad arc was over. After reading  the novel I actualy went back to
                  watch the anime again even though it still only had 1 episode. Thats how much I liked the story. The art in the anime is also well drawn. In the manga the art is okay but it pales compared to manga that are on their own and not from a novel. Overall it was an anime that I really enjoyed and hope has alot of episodes or alteast more than 12 or 13",9

                Sword Art Online was a great anime at first, though the plot began to grow stale and to me it seemed that it trailed off the actual intention of it.  It is a good anime if you're into Adventure Romance, but to me, it did not live up to my expectations.  However, at times, it left me with a sentimental feeling which is why I loved it and kept watching.  Although, the Alfhiem arc wasn't as outstanding as the SAO arc.  Overall it was a pretty average series to me

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
“Hear me now. Oh thou bleak and unbearable world, thou art based and debauched as can be.”
- Don Quixote de la Mancha, The Man of La Mancha
Sword Art Online makes me regret my decision to become a critic whenever I think about it. Never before has a show made me so empty and angry inside. It just feels so unbearably wrong on almost every significant level that watching it just devolves into a game of, “find the respectable episode.” A show that should tap into my inner geek and provide insight into gamer culture when the gamers are exposed to a deadly
                  situation is squandered in favor opting to show us the life of one teenage boy barely reacting to that deadly situation. As both an actual gamer and someone who would like to believe that humans on the whole are rational, thinking people who have some idea of common sense even at their lowest point, SAO actively offends me. When I watched this show, it was the first time that I actually needed to take notes on something I was critiquing while binge-watching it. No, scratch that, it wasn’t a binge-watching session, it was a massacre of everything I love about anime. So with that out of the way, I’ll get onto the... you know, you shouldn’t necessarily think of this as a review so much as you should think of it as an analysis of how Sword Art Online is wrong. It is one of the biggest wastes of a decent concept that I have ever seen, and only goes to show how anything can become popular simply based on its premise. I’ll be going on for a long, long while about this, so you better strap in, because I will not let up. I’m not good with mincing words, and the problems with Sword Art Online are so intricate that simply giving a broad idea of their badness would not do the show justice. Let it be known that I do not hate people who like Sword Art Online in spite of how long this review is and how angry I am at this show, but also let it be known that I am unwavering in my dislike for this show, and reserve my right to express this point of view. 
Sword Art Online is A-1 Pictures’ ongoing cash cow based on the light novel written by Reki Kawahara. The show is directed by Tomohiko Ito, who also directed the acclaimed Silver Spoon, written by Himoru Arakawa of Fullmetal Alchemist fame. The first novel was originally published online in 2002 after it exceeded the word limit for a contest that Kawahara was hoping submit it to. Interestingly enough, the first novel was put on the net only a few months after .hack//Sign, another anime about being trapped in an MMO, had aired in Japan. This was also in the same year that Final Fantasy XI, the first MMO in the long-running RPG series, hit the market. FFXI would go on to be the most profitable game in said series. The novel series still goes on to this day, and while the novels may possibly explain some things that don’t make sense in the show, I will not be referring to them because 1. I haven’t read them. And 2. Any piece of media should be able to stand on its own without the need to refer to anything else, so to judge SAO impartially, the light novels must be left out of the equation. The series adapts the first four light novels, the first two being part of the Aincrad arc in Sword Art Online, and the next two being part of the Fairy Dance arc in ALFheim Online. I’ll tackle these two parts individually.
 Chances are you already know the plot to the first half. Sword Art Online is the hot new virtual reality MMORPG that only about 10,000 people can get on launch day. Unfortunately for them, logging onto SAO traps them inside the game, and the only way to leave is to beat all 100 floors of the in-game castle Aincrad. If any player dies in the game, the microwave technology in the VR headsets that somehow managed to be deemed safe for the market will fry their brains and kill them IRL. For some indiscernible reason, the show decides not to focus on the people bravely fighting on the front lines or the culture of the game’s world, but rather the adventures of this one guy called Kirito (Bryce Papenbrook), and his eventual girlfriend Asuna (Cherami Leigh). And here comes problem number one in SAO: The pacing. 
Since the original story of SAO’s first arc was told in two novels, one of which chronicled the very beginning and very end of the story and the other detailing several side stories, the creators decided to put these stories in chronological order. While this was likely the best they could do the make the story cohesive it absolutely kills any sense of a consistent tone. An incredibly dark episode detailing the death of several characters, many of whom aren’t given anywhere near enough personality for me to care, is immediately followed by Kirito going on a lighthearted adventure with a young girl. This contributes nothing to the overall plot whatsoever. The next two episodes detail a dark murder mystery that also has no relevance to the overall plot whatsoever and the episode after that is just barely relevant at all but still could’ve been cut without too much consequence. The actual plot finally resurfaces in the next episode, but by then the show is just dragging. And I use the term, “actual plot,” very loosely. As far as I can see the show clearly doesn’t know what to do with itself. Almost every episode serves to introduce an aspect of SAO’s game mechanics that never serves any other purpose after they're introduced, and the massive time skips between each episode don’t help, making the passage of time seem jarring at best and flat out perplexing at worst. This leaves Kirito’s progression with no real meaning since the audience is constantly being flung into the future with no indication of anyone’s progress, and the struggle to beat the game effectively becomes a side story for most of the show’s first half. One second Kirito will have average stats, then he’ll be a God among players. One episode he’ll be an unpopular player regarded as a cheater, then he’ll be a renowned front-line fighter with absolutely no explanation. 
All of this could’ve been moot if there were good characters to be found, but unfortunately the world we live in isn’t so kind. Kirito himself is really bland, almost to the point of self-parody. And while that would be enough to make him just kind of “eh,” by protagonist standards what really brings him down to the level of “bad,” is just how inconsistent and idiotic he is. Kirito does a large deal of irrational or downright moronic things throughout the show that are meant to portray him as a complex character. But since they almost always result in people dying, he comes across as very unsympathetic. The inconsistency comes into play when one finds out that Kirito is seen as a “solo player,” by everyone else in the cast. Kirito is constantly referred to as being infamous for playing by himself despite tagging along with another player in every single episode without exception. Even the introductory episode pairs him up with a side character who has absolutely no plot relevance whatsoever by the show’s end (And somehow manages one of the best characters in the show despite this). The idea is that he’s supposed to develop into a more social person despite supposedly being bad with people, but this aspect of his character is barely present at all, even when he’s interacting with the people around him. He has decent conversation skills, he’s good with words, he’s not socially awkward in the least, and he generally comes across as a nice guy. There is technically a reason for why he’s supposed to be a solo player, but it totally falls flat and makes little sense. So not only is Kirito not a solo player, but he has no relatable reason to even want to be one in the first place. To make matters even worse, the message of Kirito becoming more of a team player is totally scrapped in the finale, where Kirito ends up in a one-on-one fight which ends in the most infuriating way possible. And for as interesting as the writers tried to make him, Kirito is just boring. I don’t remember a single thing about him aside from that he likes video games, Asuna, black coats, swords, and saying that he’s a solo player. Furthermore, the fact that he is undisputably the best player in the game removes almost all sense of tension from most of the episodes, since the enemies can barely even scratch him. And when he isn’t showing off what an unstoppable powerhouse he is, Kirito’s actual challenges are always overcome by him doing something that should by all means be impossible for him to do. He’ll either pull out an ability that was barely foreshadowed, or just break the rules of the game altogether with no explanation as to how he did so.
  When I realized how long I spent writing about how bad the main character is before even getting to almost everyone else trapped in SAO, it dawned on me just how much Kirito was a true testament to how bad the show's writing is. While Asuna is just kind of a boring, overdone tsundere girl, I at least appreciate how she and Kirito do enter a functional relationship. This only serves to irritate me when I remember that the show tries to have a harem anyway. Speaking of the harem, Silica (Christine Marie Cabanos) and Lizbeth (Sarah Ann Williams), the first two members of Kirito’s not-harem, are so forgettable that talking about them feels like I’m giving the show too much credit. Some of Kirito’s other allies like Agil (Patrick Seitz) and Klein (Kirk Thornton) aren’t amazing, but since they’re at the very least “good,” that automatically elevates them to the position of the best characters in the show. Klein in particular should have been the main character, while Agil should have taken an authoritative position considering that he seems to be one of the only rational adults playing this game. The fact that neither of these things are part of the show depresses me to no end.
However, the entire collective of SAO’s players is a character all its own, one with it’s own story, behavior, and role in the plot. Sadly, it’s the worst character in the show as a result. The other players of the game are constantly alluded to by the main characters throughout the series, and these brief snippets into their thought process details just how asinine they are. The cardinal sin committed here is that everyone is playing Sword Art Online like it’s a normal MMO. Players set up businesses and charge other players money for their wares despite the fact that everyone’s best interest is to cooperate and help each other without hindering each other. The money they charge on those wares is money their customers won’t have to buy items from NPC’s that could save their life later down the line. In addition, while the front lines are off-limits to underleveled players, the idea that those underleveled players, almost all of whom are minors, are allowed to access high-level dungeons in the first place makes no sense. Since experience is hard to farm in SAO due to enemies not respawning quickly, the logical conclusion is to keep players who don’t intend to go to the front lines from doing anything that would keep potential recruits from gaining necessary experience. To this end, the adult players should have formed one organized militia that accepted potential recruits and kept players from going into dungeons above their skill level. The towns in-game are safe zones where the only way for a player to die there is if someone tricks them into accepting a duel to the death, so keeping them there is clearly the best option. Instead, the assault team is made up of various unaffiliated guilds, players are allowed in dungeons that will certainly get them killed, and the money made by players not participating in the boss raids is collected and given to the army through taxes. These taxes should have no way of being enforced since players cannot be killed in safe zones. 
 On the subject of player killing, the presence of any player killers aside from actual psychopaths makes little sense when one considers that if they were to weigh their options, they’d find that killing other players is an absolutely atrocious idea. Anyone who thought about it for more than a minute would realize that they would either be stuck in the game and nothing they’ve done will have mattered, or they’ll get out of the game, be responsible for killing people, and nothing they’ve done will have mattered. And despite the evidence that there is no good reason for any sane and rational person in SAO to even think that killing other players is a good idea under any circumstance, it plays a large part in several episodes.
 On another subject, the fact that lower level players decide to ostracize beta testers in spite of them being the strongest players in the game becomes unbearably stupid when the show flat-out admits that the beta testers were helping the new players for no cost. Kirito’s exacerbation of this prejudice only serves to highlight just how idiotic it was in the first place. It would be hilarious if this was meant to parody how low-level players in video games often complain about more skilled players cheating, but since it's played totally straight in this kind of situation, it's dead on arrival. With all of this in mind, I can only assume that Sword Art Online is being played by the absolute dumbest 10,000 people in Japan if I want this story to make sense. And boy oh boy, this is only the first half of the show.
My biggest fear going into Sword Art Online was without a doubt the infamous second half, which even fans of the show absolutely despise. After getting through Aincrad, Fairy Dance filled me with a sense of dread the likes of which I’ve never experienced when watching a TV show. But alas, I flew towards the sun, and was punished for my arrogance. Be warned that this part of the review does have spoilers in it for part 1, so if you haven’t watched SAO yet you may or may not want to skip these next few paragraphs if you don’t already know how the ALFheim Online arc is set up. Ready? Go.
After Kirito; or as he’s known in reality, Kazuto Kirigaya; has beaten SAO and returned to the real world, he finds that Asuna still appears to be stuck in a comatose state, despite Sword Art Online no longer existing. One day while visiting her in the hospital, an employee of her father’s company drops by, says that he’s basically going to marry Asuna whether she likes it or not, and then says some shady stuff to Kirito. Kirito then finds out that a figure who looks like Asuna has been seen in an online game called ALFheim Online, which is basically just like Sword Art Online except it has magic and flying. Along the way, Kirito runs into a player named Lefea (Cassandra Lee Morris), who helps him on his journey, while trying to bond with his sister Suguha (Cassandra Lee Morris) back in the real world. Oh, and I forgot to mention that Leafa and Suguha are one and the same and Kirito doesn’t know it. This is then compounded by Suguha somehow not realizing that Kirito is her brother Kazuto despite how he looks almost exactly like her brother, sounds exactly like her brother, and acts exactly like her brother. And it’s all downhill from there.
 The problems with the ALO arc are so numerous that it gives me a migraine just trying to start thinking about them. Let’s start by tackling the biggest aspect of the story, ALFheim Online itself. The game’s big draw is that a player can join one of several races who are encouraged to attack players from other races for items and money. They can fly for about ten minutes at a time, and unlike SAO, you have to actually know your way around a sword to get by. The races compete to finish the game’s final quest before anyone else does. Whichever race completes this quest will be granted flight without a time limit. Ignoring that permanently destroying the game’s balance would eliminate the need for a race system anyway, it makes no sense that there’s even a conflict at this point in time. Since Kirito’s chosen race, the Spriggans, are usually derided as being weak, it’s clear that there are tiers in this game, which logically means that one faction should have overwhelming numbers that give them a huge advantage over every other race due to players wanting to spec towards the inherently stronger race. It is stated that ALO is a highly competitive game, so if there are imbalances in it someone should have already completed the quest and realized the big twist behind it. This would make the race war component an absolute joke. To make matters worse, it seems like the people playing the game barely have any idea how it functions. Despite the Spriggans supposedly being only skilled at treasure hunting and illusions, Kirito is able to transform himself into a large beast using Spriggan magic that is very clearly not an illusion. Thinking about why he’s the only Spriggan to have ever done this is baffling enough, but he also only uses it during one battle with little to no plot relevance, and it is never explained why no one has used this before. If the Spriggans could use this en masse, killing other players would obviously be a cinch. 
The overarching plot is somehow even more awfully put-together than the first. It is revealed at the end of the series that the grand quest that grants eternal flight takes the player to the tree which houses the antagonist's headquarters, and that said headquarters is inaccessible to normal players anyway. There is no reason whatsoever for the antagonist to situate himself here other than for the purpose of giving Kirito a focal point for finding Asuna. If the big bad doesn’t want people in the tree, why does he intentionally make it the focus of the game’s biggest quest? Kirito is able to get the furthest anyone has ever gotten in that quest through sheer numbers and skill and he realizes the truth behind it immediately.
On the subject of player killing, I want to pose a question. Do you know how to take all of the tension out of a show about an MMORPG where people die? It’s by only making that the first half of your show. No one in ALO dies for real when their character is killed, so whenever the show tries to actually play death for drama it just feels like the characters are LARPing in a video game. There is no reason to so heavily avoid death when its consequences aren’t even really fleshed out very well, which can be said of a lot of ALO’s mechanics, aside from flying. And despite so many additional factors, there really doesn't seem to be anything that really differentiates SAO and ALO when you get down to it, so the way in which the show desperately tries to convince the viewers that there is feels incredibly disingenuous. 
However, what really broke my suspension of disbelief was the prospect that not only were ALFheim Online and Sword Art Online technically compatible to the point where Kirito is able to keep all of his skills but not his items, but the fact that ALFheim Online was made with Sword Art Online’s source code and put on Sword Art Online’s servers all while the Sword Art Online incident was still going in part 1. Considering that they only got the servers and the source code since the original company that owned them obviously went bankrupt as a result of the incident, it makes no sense as to why anyone would want these servers or want to make a game using SAO’s data. They would obviously face a large deal of public backlash that would prevent them from making any sort of profit. This isn’t even getting into minor infractions like how the randomly generated avatar system is a terrible idea for an MMO and it only serves to give Kirito a hairstyle that his sister wouldn’t recognize (despite being exactly the same as his real self in almost every other way and also despite the fact that no one would want to play an MMO where they cannot customize their character) , the lack of specs on the race selection screen, or the notion that faction leaders need to hold in-person meetings when they can just message each other. By now it’s pretty easy to see just how badly thought out the plot of the ALO arc is, but trust me when I say this is only the beginning.
And then we get to the new characters, and by new characters, I mean Suguha and Sugou (Todd Haberkorn) A.K.A. siscon bait and the villain. Despite an entirely new cast having been introduced, only these two members of said cast actually matter. The rest of them are unimportant and superfluous to a ridiculous degree. On the one hand, Suguha can basically be boiled down to one defining character trait, and that trait is, “Feels guilty about loving her brother/cousin, Kirito.” That is actually it. This is one of the single most tired and stock anime tropes of all time, the sister who loves her brother who isn’t actually his sister and/or isn’t even related by blood, and Kawahara relying on this makes me downright sick. However, the show makes it even worse because of the fact that Kirito already has a love interest in Asuna. So this can’t even really be called a love triangle. We know that Kirito is going to choose Asuna anyway, so Suguha’s interest in him just boils down to pandering to shippers. The purpose behind it is simply to reinforce just how much of a wish-fulfillment character Kirito is for teenage boys. He could have his pick of any of these girls if he wanted to, and since it’s intended for teenage boys to want to be Kirito, this is obviously appealing to them. Suguha is just here for the crowd that thinks that “incest is wincest,” and none of this would matter if Suguha’s character was done well. But the execution is so rushed, boring, and insignificant that the pandering elements of this not-romance are forced into the forefront.
The villain, Sugou, is terrible in the worst way possible. While I am able to enjoy characters who are total scumbags very often, they need to be done carefully, and Sugou, or as he likes to be called “King Oberon,” is a grim reminder of that. He’s an evil genius who rerouted SAO’s servers and managed to store the consciousness of 300 players in ALO in order to run brainwashing experiments. He has no explained motivation for this. Aside from that, his only other goal is having his way with Asuna, which is played up as being far more egregious than the whole brainwashing thing, and serves only as an excuse to make the audience hate him. Here, Sugou wanting to posses Asuna is clearly creepy and unethical, but the brainwashing aspect of it barely factors into how we perceive him as a villain. It’s not even really explained why he’s so obsessed with Asuna or why he has such a huge God complex. His evil plan takes such a large backseat that I have trouble remembering if Kirito ever found out about it. All of these factors put together make it impossible for me to enjoy Sugou in any respect. If I were to talk any more about the new cast members, I could only refer to them in the basest of terms. They would be Suguha’s clingy friend, the two leaders of different factions who both have the hots for Kirito as well, and the guy Kirito fights in episode 20. Since that’s about all the character I can ascribe to them, we should move on.
We now find ourselves look at the returning cast, and there are still a wide array of problems with all two of them. For one, Kirito is still far too overpowered. Despite ALO working on an entirely different set of rules, and only having the weak starting gear, Kirito is able to defeat three serious ALO players as soon as he starts playing the game with very little effort. Kirito then proceeds to absolutely destroy almost everyone else he comes across for the rest of the show. It just goes to show that Kirito could have gone through the entire game with his kit from SAO and nothing would have changed at all. There isn’t even the excuse that it would give him a reason to constantly dual wield because he had lost one of his swords in SAO. And speaking of dual wielding, despite the show explicitly telling the audience that dual wielding is the only skill that Kirito cannot use in ALO, he does it anyway later. But none of this compares to the finale, where Kirito once again pulls out yet another Deus ex Machina that may actually be worse than the one from the first half's finale. Furthermore, the seven day time limit Kirito has before the dirtbag who wants Asuna becomes a part of her family is never brought up after its initial establishment, almost as if he just forgot about it. This is made worse by Kirito’s constant detours and messing around doing things that don’t matter. Just telling everyone that something is going on that has real life consequences would probably get them to drop what they’re doing and help him. And if he thinks no one would believe him then he should just make a beeline for the world tree. But no, we have to fight these guys because they’re going to start a war that won’t matter because everyone is playing a video game. The only parts I liked with Kirito was where he was interacting with his adopted daughter, Yui (Stephanie Sheh), who is the only character in the show who I unequivocally like, but they're so few and far between that they might as well not matter. 
Asuna on the other hand is majorly sidelined, turned into a damsel in distress who does only one useful thing and spends the rest of her time as a device to show us how evil the bad guy is. She gets whatever personality she once had drained out of her, and spends most of her time sitting around in a cage before escaping, only to get caught and put in the cage again. This in turn gives way to an absolutely insulting scene where she is groped by people working for Sugou who have tentacle slug avatars for no reason other than to grope her in a specific way. The notion that anyone would knowingly make these their avatars is bad enough, but since the scene in which Asuna is groped is clearly meant to be titillating despite how unnerving it is in context, I actually needed to take a break from watching the show. So yeah, that about sums up how utterly depraved this show's writing is when all's said and done. Let’s just get this over with.
All of this ranting may make it seem like SAO is devoid of almost anything of value. But lo and behold there are some good things about it. As I’ve previously mentioned, Kirito and Asuna’s functioning relationship is a refreshing change from the normal “will-they-or-won’t-they?” plot that shows like this usually take. The episodes where the two are just bonding together easily make up the best episodes in this show since they actually give the two a fair bit of characterization. I want to give props to the story that takes place right after they get married where they end up taking care Yui together for being surprisingly heartfelt. It produced the only episodes of this forlorn trainwreck that I unironically liked. Also, some of the occasional video game touches made the worlds of SAO and ALO seem more like the fully realized games I felt they should have been. Moments like Kirito’s first flight in ALFheim Online being given a distinct music track, which mirrors how many RPGs do the same thing, made for a genuinely nice scene, and when Kirito has to delete his items at the beginning of ALO, it feels brutally realistic and resonates with my gamer side. Unfortunately those moments are few and far between, and the only other parts of the show I enjoyed were Kirito’s other friends, Klein and Agil.
Now, in terms of animation and sound, SAO is nothing to write home about. The action scenes are decently animated but definitely not worth the slog one must go through to get to them, and their reused animation frames are incredibly distracting. I usually hear a lot of praise being tossed at them, but the way I see it the fight scenes just have a lot of flair and very little weight. Even though the animation in a show like Baccano! may be very rough, the show itself makes up for this by having each action taken in their fight scenes matter. SAO’s fights are just boring and unmemorable. The normal animation in the scenes where people are just hanging around and talking is fine and the character designs are appealing, but the art style itself is just kind of generic. While the soundtrack is provided by acclaimed composer Yuki Kajiura, known for her work on Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica, I barely remember any music from the show except for some obnoxious chanting that plays over 95% of all of the show’s fight scenes. And though the opening and ending themes sound decent enough, they’re not very entertaining from a visual standpoint. In terms of the performances given, most of them are just kind of okay. Bryce Papenbrook and Cherami Leigh do fine in their given roles, as do all the other cast members, but believe me when I say that no actor stands out in this show at all. The one who comes closest is Stephanie Sheh as Yui, Kirito and Asuna’s adopted daughter, especially in ALO, where she’s practically the only decent thing about it. However, Sheh still has to contend with her character being part of an awful script. I don’t blame these actors at all since the workable material is practically non-existent, but it still stings that such proficient actors have their talents squandered on such a bad show.
By the end of the series, my notes had devolved from detailed criticisms into incoherent bursts of expletives and insults. Knowing that such incoherent rambling came from my thought process worries me, but it also serves to remind me of how much I hated watching Sword Art Online. Everything about the show fails at the most basic of levels, mashing a great concept with terrible storytelling, atrocious characters, and only half-decent animation and music. When I remember that Baccano! has struggled to find an audience and that a lot of Sword Art Online fans that I talked to watched the show simply because they found the concept intriguing, it just reaffirms the idea in my mind that all one really needs to make something popular is a great concept. With that said, if you were planning on watching this show, watch Log Horizon instead. I haven’t seen it, and the author was arrested for tax evasion, but I still feel more comfortable giving his property more exposure than Sword Art Online simply out of principle. The only good thing to come out of this show’s existence is Sword Art Online: Abridged, the Youtube parody of the show made by Something Witty Entertainment. Otherwise, I will always keep my memories of watching Sword Art Online in the darkest depths in my mind in a folder labeled, “A show about an MMORPG written by someone who clearly knows nothing about MMORPG’s.” And the absolute worst part about all of this? I’ve effectively trapped myself in a cycle which predicates that I’m watching the second season, the movie, and any seasons to come. The ride never ends, and I wish to high heaven that it did.
Final Verdict: 1/10
Don’t believe the hype",1

                Please note that this is only my second anime... the first being Angel Beats!  I also love Angel Beats, but let's focus on SAO cos this is SAO's page.  I have an extremely good opinion of every single aspect of this anime.  I really have to thank my friend for recommending such a great piece of art to me.  SAO is a very interesting piece of work and kudos to the company who created this anime and kudos to Kajiura Yuki for composing such beautiful music to accompany this anime.  The music alone is so beautiful and perfect for every
                  situation its fitted into.  This is truly a masterpiece.  Yes I know some people may not like it because they think its to cliche, however I'm not a fanboy or anything but I will definitely defend SAO forever.  
Oh and I also want to add that all of the opening and ending songs that were part of this anime are very beautiful works of arts themselves.  All of the songs are very catchy and pleasing to the ears especially episode 2-14 opening theme (its called Crossing Fields, if any one is interested) with a wonderful melody.",10

                Sword Art Online was probably one of the best animated animes I have ever seen. Even though that the animation was amazing, the way that the story was handled is terrible.
Story - 5
The whole premise of the story was indeed an interesting one, but it what lacked was a steady pacing. It skipped 2 whole years for the non-light novel readers and it somewhat confused me at the time I first watched it back in 2012.
Art - 10
It is stunning, fluid, and beautiful. A-1 Pictures has always been giving us beautifully animated shows and this was one of them. Sadly, the story did not live
                  up to its glory.
Sound - 8
I really liked the voice acting and music in this one. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka's voice for Kirito was one of those voices that was hard to adapt in English. Bryce Papenbrook did a pretty decent job at it. Haruka Tomatsu's voice for Asuna was a really good one. I liked her English adaptation by Cherami Leigh. The music was also very good. The two opening and ending themes were great. My favorite would be Dream World by Haruka Tomatsu.
Character - 3
The character development was pure trash. This is basically how the development went step-by-step: Here is a character. This is their occupation. High possibility of having a thing for the main character. It was pathetic. One character I despised the most out of this series would have to be that sick s.o.b. nearing the end of the second half. He was more than trash.
Enjoyment - 6
I have to admit that I did enjoy the anime at the time. It was exciting when Kirito fought. Again, I admittedly had some fun watching this series.
Overall - 5
This anime was not a very good one, but it isn't that bad either. Sure the characters would be somewhat unlikeable, but what I can say is that you will enjoy the art and sound. I strongly recommend to stream this anime, because DVD's by Aniplex are INSANELY expensive. Then again it's your choice. Hope my first review helped any of you guys.",5
"
                Ah, Sword Art Online... If only there was a way to summarize this trainwreck of an anime with just a couple of sentences so as to prevent other people from  experiencing such blatant disappointment. Unfortunately, as you may have already noticed, there isn't. Since there are so many things wrong with this anime, it's no surprise that so many of its reviews have turned into full-blown rants. I will do my best not to do so, but I can't make any promises. 
After watching the first episode of this anime, I was seriously intrigued and really looking forward to the rest of it. The
                  premise seemed excellent, for it was truly unique and held a lot of potential. Despite not being a gamer myself or caring about games in the slightest, I still thought I wasl in for a treat and that this show might even become one of my favorites. Boy, was I wrong. 
Although the first two episodes actually have a plot line and are therefore interesting, all logic disappears after episode 3. Suddenly, months have passed, and characters that were originally introduced are nowhere to be found. New characters randomly start appearing and turn this anime into a harem instead of a survival game. This joke of a narrative continues throughout the entire series, putting aside character development, story, life lessons, and anything in-between for the sheer purpose of... girls? (Can't really say breasts since there isn't even any fan service to justify this kind of behavior, so I really don't know what the point of it was). 
As with the infamous ""monster of the week"" scenario from Sailor Moon, SAO uses a ""girl of the week"" one, where each girl has no backstory or personality (or even any value as a plot device). Their whole existence depends on acting cute in front of the MC, being saved by the MC, and then essentially never seeing the MC again (even if they're technically indebted to him for saving their lives). 
The only time one of these girl-bots/NPCs/useless background characters actually dies, the MC spends his time mopping around and talking to himself in order to elicit some kind of response from the viewer (pity? sadness? compassion?), but even this attempt quickly falls flat. Since these characters die pretty much right after they are introduced (and months are mysteriously brushed over in this show), it is impossible to understand what sort of connection the MC had with these characters and therefore how he feels in relation to them. The main character's feelings, however, are another topic altogether. 
Our main character, Kirito-kun, is the epitome of ""ordinary"" in the real world while simultaneously being the epitome of ""invincible"" in SAO. You may think ""What's wrong with that? It's an anime, after all"", but the reality is that, even for an anime, the behavior of the main character and of the gaming world itself make no sense whatsoever. Forget rigorous training, failed attempts, and tears-while-trying. Our main character is so much better than that. He can do anything he puts his mind to (literally) without ever breaking a sweat. From the first few episodes, his skills and HP are already better than everyone else's, no one can beat him, everyone's heard about him, yadda yadda yadda. 
Again, if this character actually had some development, or, idunno, a personality, perhaps this idea could have worked. In the case of Kirito, however, none of this is necessary. It's enough that he's there. And that is literally all he does as a character, he's just... there. To beat monsters and to reject girls. He has no backstory, no motivations or ambitions (other than beating the game of course, but that's kind of what this show is about, so...) or any other redeeming qualities. As a result, all his interactions and relationships are just as superficial as he is, and have no deeper meaning other than exchanging a few words and either making alliances with or fighting against other players. It is precisely for this reason that I have developed a hypothesis where I think that even if you replaced Kirito with a potato, there would be no difference whatsoever. Heck, if anything, maybe the show would actually become funny or entertaining. A potato that can wield two swords and marry another potato, now that's interesting... 
And that's where our second ""potato"" (aka bland, uninteresting, and shallow) character comes in - Asuna. (No offense to potatoes. You guys are so much better than these lame characters). Although she is supposed to be the great love of our even greater Kriito-kun, she also lacks a personality, a backstory, and even fighting skills after a few episodes. Asuna quickly goes from being a bad-ass, fearless, fighting lady, to a stay-at-home mom whose greatest pleasure in life is making sandwiches for her family. Sexist much? 
Her romance with Kirito will also leave you as baffled as every other aspect of this half-baked show, for they literally confess their love to each other without even knowing each other's real names. I know it may sound funny, but it's actually sad. It's sad to see how little the writers cared about this anime and how they expected anyone else to care for it. 
This brings us to another ""surprising"" (see:  disappointing) aspect of the show - its length. While a 12 or 13-episode story-less, senseless and pointless show could have been bearable and even forgivable, there is absolutely no excuse for having something so terrible last for 25 episodes. 
If you thought the first arc was bad, then you won't believe how terrible the second arc is. In short, it's a total disaster. From the fact that they're not even playing the same game anymore (and that it's still called Sword Art Online!!!) to the already-ridiculous plot holes from the first arc that are now combined with, you guessed it, even more plot holes from the second arc, this part is an entire pain to get through. As if the poor writing and non-existent character development wasn't enough, the new subplots and scenes are guaranteed to make anyone cringe. 
Besides making Asuna even more of a non-character by locking her away in a cage in some far-off tower (ok, it's actually a tree, but who cares? The writers certainly didn't, so why should we?) to the subplot I like to call ""SAO meets Oreimo"", everything about this arc made my skin crawl. Although the ""final battle"" was slightly more exciting than the one in the first arc and lasted a bit longer (who knows how, considering that fairies can only fly for 10 minutes straight, but Kirito spent at least half an hour flying around...), the fan service, PG-13 BDSM-inspired imagery and the rape references simply killed what little respect I had left for this show. 
Perhaps the best part about the ending or near-ending was how Kirito said something to himself along the lines of ""did I actually die?"". While unintended, this was the only remotely funny part about the entire show because it showed that even the MC himself knows that he is totally unbeatable, invincible, and apparently even immortal. 
(When your own ""ordinary human"" (hence mortal) character is totally baffled by his mortality, you know there's something seriously wrong with your writing.) 
Other than that, there are absolutely no funny moments to be found in this series; no social criticisms or political statements, and sadly, not even a story worth watching. The only questions you will be left with will probably be things like ""Why did I even watch this thing?"" or ""Why did I even start watching anime in the first place?"", and so on. 
Even the mediocre-but-almost-good soundtrack and nice art won't be enough to save you from the plot-hole-ridden piece of trash this show actually is. Unless, of course, your thing is watching pointless, unfunny harems with flat, undeveloped characters that can overcome any problem by overriding any kind of pre-existent logic with last minute deus ex-machina scenarios. If that is the case, then, by all means, go for it.",3
"
                Oh man, what an anime... Love it or hate it. Looking back, when I watched the first few episodes, I got the impression that this would be awesome, and of course, it was. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not one of those high expectation animes, which end up being helpless. Anyway, on with the review.
The first two episodes really get you hooked on, but then it leads you on side-stories and friendship building that make little or no difference to plot or outcome. Even if I say they were not amazing, they were really fun to watch, and see how other people were
                  handling being stuck in a death-game, as well as the friendships formed.
The characters are characters, nothing else, they had some good depth and most people can relate to more than one, otherwise they are normal. One thing almost stopped me from continuing, and it was a dawning feeling, that both MCs, seemed like the people who would die in the end (not sure if I'm making sense here)
The plot was really good, so I'm glad they did not mess up and make the anime horrible, the art stood out, but it was nothing special, the sound was good, but it was in a game most of the time, so any little mistakes can be over-looked.
I suggest this anime for people who are a bit patient, but who love a happy-ending, with both MCs going through hell just to see each other in the real world.",10
"
                   This anime is truly a masterpiece, I watch most anime really fast to keep the story going continuously and the only reason I didn't finish this one in a single night is because my friend and I were both watching it.
   It is my number one choice anime at the moment. There are other anime that are great, I won't deny that, but even a guy like me has to admit that the emotion created in this masterpiece is inspiring. 
   My friend and I were literally glaring at the TV saying, ""If that character dies I'm going
                  to be super pissed!"" I've never been so tied to a story line an connected to the characters.
   My only gripe is that I wish that the NervGear actually existed. As my roommate said, ""I was born in the wrong generation.""",10
"
                Minor spoilers
SAO has a bad reputation, and for good reasons. It's a flawed series that could have been outstanding. So why give it a 7? All flaws aside, for me the world as a whole allowed me to dive in and leave the knit picking for after the credits rolled. 
First, what are the major problems that kept this show from becoming a masterpiece. 
The Pacing. The pacing of this show was so fast in the beginning I thought I missed an episode. Finally after about 3 or 4 episodes the show becomes steady and much easier to follow. Unfortunately the damage has already been
                  done. You can't feel that these characters have been trapped as long as they have been, and it takes away from conflict of progressing through those early levels of a game.
The characters. The characters in this suffered the opposite fate of characters in other anime. For instance look at Angel Beats. Where Angel Beats only had 13 episodes to flesh out the characters, this had 25 episodes to flesh out the characters, but instead ignored that and focused on getting in that 2nd pointless arc. Which leads me to my next point.
The 2nd arc (ep 15-25). Pointless. Need I say more. Instead of using the extra episodes to flesh out the characters and story, they put in this pointless second arc to create more suspense (I think? It's hard to tell.) Frankly even if they had ended the show the way it was at ep 14 I would have liked it better. The ending of the 1st arc (kirito leaving the hospital)  is powerful enough.
Then you have other problems. Like I never felt any real suspense, I was only surprised by the story once or twice, other than that everything was predictable. The Romance was dull and generic, and as much as this show was an action/adventure, it was more of Romance than anything else, especially with that second arc. 
But what makes the story work? It's one saving grace was the overall concept, and the world of SAO. It is such an appealing idea, and the world of SAO is so immersing that even with it's flaws the show captures you for 24 minutes and leaves you wanting more. It's a shame that this show had to have so many flaws because the concept behind it and the world were so great that it could have made a spectacular Action/Adventure or Romance.
So what the show does well, it does really well, and that's enough (at least in my case) for me to recommend this show. And on a personal note I hope that one day someone will come back to this world and fix the mistakes. Because if someone can fix the mistakes of this show, and give us a story and characters to really enjoy (as well as getting rid of the 2nd arc) then maybe we'll have the phenomenon this show could have been.",7
"
                At first when I found out about this anime, I was really excited. I mean, the plot seems interesting, not much anime out there is about being trapped in a virtual game and actually dying when die in the game. 
The first few episodes were exciting and interesting, however, that is about all to this anime. After a while, the story goes...out of interest. The girls start showing up, all flirting with the main guy. 
What I am trying to say is that the romance ruined the whole anime. Every little bit of it. Not to mention that in episode, 2 weeks has passed.",5
"
                Now, Before watching sword art online. You must understand, this is by no means, A masterpiece anime such as Code Geass or Death Note.
This anime, is an anime made, to be enjoyed, a upbeat for the most part, enjoyable anime.
The art however, is amazing to say the least, and the music is composed by none other than Yuki kajiura . Now, Yuki kajiura, Also composed Fate/Zero
and the Garden of Sinners. I rest my case.
The music, is absolutely beautiful. And excluding a singular song, : Swordland, which by the way, you will want to listen to 100 times once you hear it once, the music isn't
                  repetitive. 
The anime is slandered for its second half however, which , to be fair, I found quite enjoyable, yes, granted, it was a lower quality than the amazing first half, but they had room for a bit of comic relief and explaining the societies taking place within the games more.  
Overall this is one of my favourite anime tied up there with mirai nikki and Code geass, and it is DEFFINITELY worth the watch.",9
"
                Oh god that second half. In the beginning the story was great! It had a great concept but its kinda also been used (.hack series) but SAO pulled it off better. But it could have been a lot better. I'm trying my best to avoid spoilers but after the first 2 episodes, it kind of went down. It's like that roller coaster at six flags (I can't spell it) it goes up really high, but it goes down deep and fast. It tries to be a bunch of different genres like, mystery, action, romance, and a bunch of other spoilerific stuff. Other anime could have
                  all of those genres and pull it off better than SAO. It focuses on one genre in the beginning like action. But, they move to a different genre and focus on that one instead. They move around to a bunch of different genres and it just doesn't work. And I'm not going to get into the second season. (hint: IT SUCKS).
The art however, is very good. The boss scenes were very beautiful and colorful.
I love how fast paced the fight scenes are and the colors on their swords when they use a skill.
The music was Really good (It's Yuki Kajiura what do you expect). But, she has done better (FATE/ZERO). The voice acting is really good the VA's fit their  characters well.
Oh god, this is where the real crap is. Kirito is really bland and only just fights and what not. Asuna is a really really bad tsundere. I usually like tsunderes but god, she is such a classical tsundere. All of the other characters you really don't need to care about. I mean let's have one ENTIRE episode focused on one specific character! Then, we'll never see them again throughout the ENTIRE SERIES. And most of the characters are really annoying. Heck I don't even remember half of their names! The only good chracters are Klein and Agil. Heck they were better than the main characters themselves!
Anyways, this anime is kinda enjoyable. This would be a good gateway anime for newcomers too.",7
"
                This is a spoiler  review 
Guess this came out more fanboyish than I thought it would, but I would highly recommend seeing this series for yourself just to make sure the critics are right.
Overall: 9/10 -  While the premise of being stuck in a video game seems interesting, it's been done and the truth is that you don't get very far with that alone. SAO did an amazing job of focusing on characters and keeping things fresh. The characters really do make this anime what it is, which is an engaging and memorable series based on a somewhat cliche premise. Animation and art
                  is beautiful. Overall, this is down as one of my all time favourites.
Recommended for: Video game fans, action fans, anybody who likes the premise.
Breakdown:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story: 9.25/10-Excellent
Creativity/uniqueness bonus points: Not super unique.
Humour bonus points: +.5 There are some pretty funny parts. Not all of it really hits its mark though.
General Plot and Structure 3.5/4 - The premise of ""stuck in a videogame"" sounds really awesome, but the reality is that it's really hard to keep your attention after the first 45 minutes or so when the novelty wears off. Luckily, SAO did a really good job at keeping it interesting by focusing on the characters and having some nice twists (though not everybody appreciated one of these twists). There are some plot holes, though nothing significant I wouldn't say the plot is a masterpiece, but it was very well done. . If anything, it gets better the farther in you get.
Pacing 1.5/2 - The pacing in the first half is very quick, I assume because nobody wants to sit and watch somebody grind away for hours. Even so, it did lag in a couple of episodes. Overall though, it was well-paced and engaging.
Emotional impact: 2.75/3 - It was very touching. The romance was probably the best part, and I'm not normally a romance fan. The hatred you will feel at one point towards one of the characters was truly shaking. 
Conclusion 1/1 - The conclusion was really good overall, I especially like that it wasn't rushed.
Annoying/mindset-breaking negative points - None 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Animation: 9/10-Excellent
Artwork 2.75/3 - The artwork in SAO is great. Backgrounds and setting are beautiful and unique.
Character Designs 2.75/3 - Character designs are all interesting and there is only one part where I got mixed up between which was which.
Action Animation 1.5/2 - Fight scenes are usually very good, but definitely could have been better given what this is about.
Other animation 2/2 - Animation in most scenes is great.
------------------------------ ------------------------------ ------------------------------ -------------------
Characters: 9/10-Excellent
Personality 2.75/3 - Aside from one 12 minute or so section that kind of bugged me, characters were excellent and rounded. While side characters generally don't do much, they added extra interest and depth to SAO. One villain is by far my most hated character, and that's saying something.
Development 2.75/3 - Development is excellent in the main characters. 
Uniqueness 3.5/4 - All of the characters were relatively unique.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sound: 8.5/10-Incredible
Voice Acting (Sub) 3/3 - I quite liked the voice acting.
Music 4.5/6 - The opening and closing pieces are both good. The soundtrack during the show was excellent.

                Kirito, the protagonist, with his flurry of bladework. Here you see a main character who's clearly better than pretty much everyone else out there in combat. A burgeoning and blossoming relationship between a guy and girl. The character relationships are what makes this anime strong -- between Kirito and his sister, Kirito and Asuna, Kirito and the girl who helps him in the fairy arc -- okay, so between Kirito and those he befriends and cherishes. But to be perfectly honest, I could live my life without having seen these 25 episodes. It's not a must-see, in my opinion, and the second season is apparently
                  worse. Kirito is certainly a noble character, but Fairy Tail is definitely a better anime by A-1 Pictures.",7
"
                Let's be true for a minute. This anime was delightful but there are bad aspects too, let me explain this;
 I should have to say about this anime;
First of all story was great. There are a subject engulfing than the first part 
 but I would say infamous second season.
 Second drawing and personality of the characters was nice. I really like Asuna's personality.
Third I don't like opening and ending songs. Becoming more beautiful than I expected for this anime. But if you like swords,challenging things,pretty faces with characters... than you should have to  try this anime. 
Yes it's a popular anime, yes it
                  has flaws, no it's not perfect, but at the very least in my opinion it is enjoyable. Try this anime",8

                Text written in engilsh
This anime's aesthetica is very good. It's innovator in animes because events occur in a game. The most cool thing that it's settled on 2022. It's indicate that we could play SAO in future! However, the best fucking good thing is that we could die gaming this game. Yes, we could.
As I said in the beginning, I think that it is very nice the idea of characters is in the game, the villains, the events are linked to the game and story is told inside the game. The story of this anime is simple. But it doesn't show whole game (the 100
                  levels). Because of that, Sword Art Online could be better if it would have more details about game. In the first bunch of episodes, I think it's very cool! There are shounem and epic battles, produced with nice graphics, on first bunch of epidodes. However, suddenly genres of story changes entirely, going from most shounem to most romance. I think that this twist very abrupt, so I dislike this point.
About Alfheim Online (or ALO, second cour, 15-25), in my opinion it's not a complete shit, but it can't be compared with Sword Art Online (SAO, first cour, 1-14), because in SAO they are in a more dangerous situation than ALO. Furthermore there are villains, bosses, guilds and characters quite better in first cour than second.
About characters, there are only Kirito and Asuna, the ""couple"" of the series. Rest is without story, development and targets. They are but have different talents than couple to support them.
About animation, I don't think that it's the best in animes, but it's good. Openings and endings are so good. Dubbings (seiyuu stuff) and soundtracks are good too.
In overral, anime is too cozy to watch. However, as the series develops, the genre changes abruptly. That's why some people dropped it.
Texto escrito em Pt-Br(Minha lingua)
A estetíca do anime é muito boa,ele é inovador em trazer um anime no qual os acontecimentos estão dentro do jogo,e mais legal ainda em 2022,nóis vamos poder jogar SAO,e o mais foda de tudo é que vamos morrer jogando o jogo.Yes.
Como já disse no começo eu achei muito legal essa ideia de os personagens estarem dentro do jogo,os vilões,os acontecimentos estarem relacionados ao jogo e a história se passar no jogo,a história do anime é simples porém não mostro o jogo inteiro então o anime poderia ter muito mais detalhes sobre o jogo,tornando o anime melhor.Nos primeiros episódios eu achei super da hora,um começo shonen,com lutas fodas,e uma estetíca muito boa,porém do nada o anime muda completamente de gênero que vai de shonen-romance,eu achei essa mudança muito repentina,então eu não gostei desse ponto :/,sobre o alfheim(2 tp)na minha opinião não foi uma bosta completa mais não se compara a 1 tp(SAO),por causa que na 1 tp eles estavam numa situação muito mais crítica que a 2 tp e na 1 tp os vilôes,bosses,guildas,personagens eram muito melhores do que a 2 tp.
Em relação as personagens,praticamente só tem o Kirito e a Asuna,que é o 'casal' da serie,o resto é tudo sem história,não tem objetivos e só tem talentos diferentes,que seriam uma espécie de 'suporte' para o casal.
Sobre a animação,eu não achei uma das melhores mais é legal,as aberturas e endings são muito boas e a dublagem e a trilha sonora também.
O anime em geral é muito gostoso de assistir,porém ao decorrer da serie,o gênero muda drasticamente,que foi um dos maiores motivos de muitas pessoas pararem de assistir a série.",8

                I recently though of doing random anime review on here, and I had to choose Sword Art Online for the first one, because this show is very special to me. In the sense that I have not ever seen a show that is this comically bad, yet so popular.
The reason for Sword Art Online’s popularity, I believe, hides behind its interesting concept to the anime fanbase. A virtual reality game which you can almost physically be in, though not really. It is the dream of any gamer, and there are some idiots in this world who might even be want to trapped in one. It
                  is not a rare fact to anyone that the majority of the anime fanbase consists of regular gamers. Turning Sword Art Online into their ultimate fantasy, add in a vibrant harem of hot chicks and it’s perfect.
Story: 2.7/10
Whomever wrote the scrip for Sword Art Online, was very confused about the genres he was going to focus on. Sword Art Online starts off as a dramatic anime, which emphasizes death and the hard loss behind it. The drama in the first two episodes is brilliant, but do not get your hopes up, because everything else is very disappointing. After the first two episodes we get lots of girls. And all these girls fall in love with our main character; Kirito. Why do they fall in love with him? Because he has been blessed by the harem God, that controls the feelings of all women, anime. Anyway, these girls get one or two episodes on them, in which they are saved by Kirito, fall in love with him, and then Kirito just straight up walks out. If they didn’t appear later on in the series, I would have thought that all this was filler.
The main objective in the first half of Sword Art Online is to beat the game, in order to escape. Now being trapped in a Virtual Reality Game, where almost everyone carries weapons and there is no government, you would think that escape would be a pressing matter. But nope, let’s go fishing. Because every gamer loves fishing.
After the first few episodes escape from the game is no longer a concern for the main characters, but building a nice family in their teenage years is. The ‘main plot’ comes back midway and is solved in an episode or two, and then completely thrown out for a new plot, which is a complete rip off of every Mario game ever made. Oh and involves incest… fml.
You know the scrip writers are not very bright when the word BEATER comes from the word BETA TESTER and CHEATER, put together. What. The. Fu*k. 
Characters: 1.9 (It doesn’t deserve a 2)
There are three main characters in Sword Art Online; Harem King Kirito-chan, Mary Sue and Incest Fanservice. I will also talk about supporting characters as a whole and the two main antagonists; “I forgot, lelelel” and Professor Evil. (Don’t worry if you don’t get the character jokes, it’s just to make any Sword Art Online fan feel bad)
First there is Kirito, also known as Kazuto Kirigaya (Don’t care if I spelled that wrong, because that’s how little significance this real name has), who is the most badass man to ever walk planet Earth, and gets all the gamer girls. No like seriously, everyone he meets. Even Kein. Kirito is a character that is insanely strong, even stronger than the game itself. He is possible the man with the biggest plot armor in all of anime. Like what happened in the final fight of the first arc?? Even in the second arc, like how did he win? How did he become the GM outta nowhere? Through the power of Love and Friendship!!! There really isn’t much to say about Kirito since he doesn’t really do much, character wise. All he does is: save girls, beat bad guys, and go fishing.
He’s the strongest Sword Art Online player, and for the convenience of the plot, did it by playing solo. Now I don’t play many MMOs but even I know that, it just doesn’t happen. He is literally there to just solve every problem by himself, even if he can’t do it, he does it, because fu*k it. And he always comes out unharmed.
And the worst part is, all his fights are won through him slashing his swords really hard. There are no tactics, no surprises, just  “AAARRGHHH”!! FRIENDSHIP POWWAAAHHHH “STAR BUST STREAMMMMM”. Kirito Dies… Lol no, he lives…
Then there is Asuna. She starts off as a very badass female character, something you do not get in anime a lot, but then gives all of that up so that she can cook for her husbandu. No seriously, why did Asuna waste time learning how to cook, while they were trapped in a life threatening game. Makes you wonder, if they ever wanted to escape in the first place.
Other than Kirito no one in this series actually does anything, including Asuna, so cooking for him and providing us with fanservice was the only reason she existed in this anime.
 then for the last main character of the Sword Art Online series. His freaking cousin.
The only reason Suguha existed was because Asuna didn’t have bigger boobs and because incest was the only thing Kirito was missing in his harem. And sure, marrying your cousin is acceptable in many cultures, maybe Japan, but she lived with him like his sister. His actual fu*king sister. She fell in love with her brotherly figure. That shit is messed up.
Even in the second half of Sword Art Online, where she was important she really didn’t do anything, except tell Kirito where to go, and how to play. Not much to say.
The supporting characters of this series, don’t really need to exist. Yui is dues ex machina for every situation. Klein, despite having potential in the first half, never comes back again until the next season. There is Kirito’s harem which got one episode to get Kirito’s wand, and then never appeared again. Basically these characters could be replaced with walls and nothing much would change.
Now lets talk about the villains. First villain; Kayaba. He is the one responsible for creating this world, where he wanted the burden of death to also exist in games, like it did in real life. Why? The writer couldn’t think of anything and so Kayaba actually, forgot why….. I’ve heard rumors that SAO was written while the author was 16 years old, I think he might have been 5 tbh.
The next villain is Sugou. He wants power, money and women. The End. Kirito beats him with bullshit. Shitty villain, shitty character and shitty ending.
Enjoyment: 8.4/10
The animation, scenery and music are actually very well done is Sword Art Online. The production value for this series was really high because, even though the producers of this anime did not know how to write a story, they knew the type of stuff people will watch and invest their money in. And hence they used a lot of money because they knew they were going to make a lot of money. And most people cannot argue that the show was indeed enjoyable. It was actually entertaining. Even more so entertaining, when you realize that it’s really bad and can laugh at it while watching old episodes to write reviews on website >_>.
The action sequences in this anime are just fine. They don’t really stand out, specially for an anime with ‘Action’ as one of it’s genres. And they are very bland, in the sense that Kirito just fights with his swords. Though it is a game about swords, I expected more imaginary powers, like in an actual fantasy MMO game.
Final Results: 5.4/10",5

                *may contain spoilers*
Why do we like video games?
Well I don't know, why do others love them, but the reason I love video games, is that I can do whatever I want. But of course that also includes killing, stealing, raping, and nobody will punish me for it, at least not in the real life. But would that change, if one day that game would become my reality? Would I still be able to pull the trigger? It's a really interesting conception, and as a gamer, I was really hyped up about this anime the first time I've heard of it. So I watched it and...
Okay,
                  I want to tell you something first. As I've noticed, people usually categorize SAO watchers, as SAO haters, or SAO fans. A SAO hater is annoyed by the very existence of the anime, and a SAO fan likes it's every bit. That's what many think, but that's rubbish. I call myself a SAO fan, because I really enjoyed the anime itself, but I can't close my eyes above it's faults.
Well it's a real pain in the *ss to rate this anime with numbers. Every aspect of it has it's good and bad sides. Let's begin with the story, shall we?
The story begins in the near future. Our main character, Kirito is a big gamer. But he is a lucky bastard, because he lives in an era, where the actual console is not a box, but a helmet, which connects to your senses and sends every signal to your brain. Since you can move without actually moving in real life, it is a great step for the VG company and this starts the era of virtual reality. And of course, everyone likes to play with others. Our story begins on the day, when the world's first virtual reality MMORPG is released. The game is called Sword Art Online. Kirito, who was a beta tester is really looking forward to go back, but soon he has to realize, this is not a game anymore. SAO's creator, Kayaba Akihiko made it impossible to log out of the game, and puts their lives at stake. From that point if a player dies, his brain is destroyed by the helmet, and the same happens when attempting to remove it. The only way out is to clear the game, and if there are other people besides me, who have ever played MMOs, well you know that takes a while.
So how is Kirito going to survive in this world?
What will be the first days like?
How will people adapt to this new situation?
How will this experience affect their mind?
Why did Kayaba Akihiko do this?
Interesting questions, aren't they? Well here comes the first problem. None of them will be answered. You will never be shown the first days, the most interesting ones! We immediately jump a month in time to see, how Kirito and a few other players defeat the first boss. After that we are shown 4 absolutely unimportant side stories. The actual story begins on the 74th floor (there are 100), 2 years after the game begins! What the hell?
Okay, I know that the light novel is the same, I've read it, but seriously guys, you've changed so many great mangas, why couldn't you change this to a better story?
Because let's agree on something, this story had potential. Even for a fellow shounen fan, even for a romance fan and even for a psychology fan, like myself.
There are tons of problems with this story. We don't have an antagonists, yeah there is Kayaba, we know about his existence, but he will never be mentioned again until the 14th episode. And here comes the worst part. In the anime called Sword Art Online, Sword Art Online ends in episode 14, which in itself wouldn't be a problem, but in this case what was the point? They didn't answer any of the important/interesting questions, they couldn't make me feel the terror, like Attack On Titan did. I was not convinced, that the gamers are scared to death because of their situation.
The whole story is about virtual reality becoming reality. But it can't be feeled. Our main character just goes forward and swings his sword, like he was in a game, when the real point of the whole story is, that he isn't in a game!
Onto the characters. Well, Kirito is badass, I have to admit that but that won't change the fact, that his behavior does not make any sense. Then we have Asuna, the female lead who will later become the center of the romance. As a big romance anime fan I just can't ignore this thing called romance. There are not even signs that they are attracted to each other and in the next moment they kiss and marry! If I had to describe it with one word, it would be ''rushed''. And that's it, we don't have any more interesting, or important characters in the SAO arc, only a certain little girl, but talking about her would be a spoiler, she's the only character with a good plot twist.
Well and you may ask, what happens in the remaining 11 episodes? Well ALfheim Online happens. After everyone gets out of SAO, Kirito is gonna have some unfinished business and because of that he will have to get into anothere VRMMORPG, called ALfheim Online, where he meets Leafa, a girl. Another unimportant character. She barely has any role in this whole thing, she will make a little conflict with Kirito, but that won't change his view in any form. Well everyone hates this arc and I can understand that. Even SAO couldn't make me believe, that something is at stake there, so why could a game that lets you die do? And once again, I know that the LN has this arc too and once again, why couldn't you change it? I doubt anyone would have been angry.
But I don't want to insult this anime only, so let me point out the two things, it does VERY WELL. Sound and view. The sound actors/actresses did a very decent job. Kirito sounds cute, but badass as well, which matches his character very well. Asuna is Tomatsu Haruka, well no comment. And all the other ones did a good job as well. The OPs and the EDs are awesome. And the OST, oh my God. Kajiura Yuki showed us once again, that she is the man! I mean woman. It's epic when it has to be, calm when it has to be, sad when it has to be. Brilliant.
Also the view, I mean the art and the animation. The characters look okay, but OMG the backgrounds! It really reminded me of the good old times when I first saw a beautiful fantasy world in an MMO. And the animation is really nice, not as good as Fate Stay Night, but does it's job very well. Also the lights and the darkness, they both operate very well.
So after all this, why did I say I'm a SAO fan? It may look like I hate it, but actually no. I see it's faults, it has many faults, I can't deny that. Technically it's awesome, but that's to be expected from a hyped anime.
The reason I love it is the most important bit: it's entertaining.
Even if I hate the story, or the characters, even if I think it could have been much better and it has wasted potential, I can't deny the fact, that I don't consider the time I spent watching is ''wasted''. I enjoyed this anime, it had some epic, and beautiful moments and I won't deny, it brought tears to my eyes a few times.
So in the end, would I recommend it?
Well I think most of you have already seen this anime, but if not... well at least give it a chance. It won't become a classic, but it definitely has it's moments. But don't expect a dark story, even with the characters dying, it's still a light-hearted anime.

                I tend to not like mainstream anime. Not because they're popular. There are titles I like that are popular, like AnoHana, Pokemon, Escaflowne, etc. It's just...most of the popular anime everybody likes either tend to be too long, riddled with pointless fanservice, or too riddled with flaws to really justify their claims of them being masterpieces, Sword Art Online fulfilling two of those points I just mentioned. I actually saw six episodes of this when it first aired, but dropped it because the anime creators decided it'd be a failure if they didn't throw in the obligatory boob fondling scene, which disgusted me so much
                  I decided to drop it all together. I avoided it like the plague until I found out it was going to air on Toonami in English. Out of boredom and out of a desire to increase my knowledge of the newbies in the voice acting scene, I decided to put my grievances aside and watch it all the way through, even the icky parts...and yeah, unfortunately, it's not very good, and I continue to be baffled at how many people like it.
The show is divided into two halves, but the summary will be about the first one. An MMORPG called Sword Art Online gets released, and Kirito, who was a beta tester, is overjoyed to be able to play the game for real. He makes a few friends along the way and has many adventures. But then the creator of SAO announces to all players that they can't log out, and if they get killed in the game, they get killed in real life too. Not wanting to be cursed with that fate, Kirito decides to try and clear every single floor all by himself so he can wake back up in the real world again. But he can't do it alone, and he and many other players endure a lot of hardship in the game, wondering if they'll ever get out.
The anime is pretty good for some cheap entertainment and to get away from reality for a bit, kinda like a game, but that's about it. It's far too flawed and far too riddled with problems to be anything other than that. One of its major problems lies in its main characters. They are actual characters rather than plot devices, but unfortunately, they're too inconsistently characterized and a little too unrealistically overpowered. Kirito fits the second bill, as he's ridiculously strong and competent, and he doesn't have much of a personality other than being extremely driven to complete the game, even though he does have some redeemable flaws. He also makes friends with girls a little too easily, though I don't call it as him having a harem (is it required for a harem to be classified as guy who happens to make friends with a lot of girls and not be romantically involved with them? Sure, he has a few love interests, but they're all unrequited save for one. Just because a guy is friends with a lot of girls doesn't automatically make it a harem. I'm a girl and a lot of my friends are guys just because we happen to have mutual interests!). Asuna is kind of a Mary Sue, as she's strong, beautiful, has lots of guys good and bad fawning for her virtual virginity, she's one of the few strong and hot female players in the game, and is good at sword fighting and cooking. She also tends to flip-flop from being strong and brave to frightened and whiny sometimes, depending on the situation, one of which is entirely understandable and justified, but doesn't redeem her in any way. All of the other side characters, though I do like them, are also rather bland and underdeveloped, and could have used more screen time. Also, the villains in this series are also cliche and annoying (though one of them is voiced by Todd Haberkorn. Awesome. He should totally do more villain roles).
The storytelling also leaves a lot to be desired. I felt like the creators were trying too hard to cram mountains of events into two half-season intervals, when they could have used the entire season to develop just the Aincrad arc and do more with it. It's not like Record of Lodoss War where it tries to shove things down your throat without giving you time to swallow it, but I felt that some characters, stories, and development could have been explored more if the producers took the whole 25 episodes and saved them just for Aincrad. There's also a lot of Deus Ex Machinas used all over the place when the writers write themselves into a corner, even with the technology-based setting. There's also some very questionable and even sorta squicky subplots in the second arc, which is universally considered the franchise's low point. But I actually didn't find the questionable subplot to be bad, because the character involved actually knows its bad and doesn't actually act on her feelings, and it's not as gross and over the top as everyone makes it out to be (especially compared to sacrilegious garbage like Kiss x Sis) so I'm lenient on the show for that. But unfortunately, it still doesn't save it from being as flawed as it is. Seriously, do a brother and sister (or in this case cousin) absolutely HAVE to have incestuous feelings in every new anime ever? There are anime brothers and sisters who don't have those kinds of feelings and interact just like normal siblings do, y'know! Can't you producers take a hint already? The music, despite being done by the awesome Yuki Kajiura, is one of her lesser works this time around. She definitely has some good pieces, but she seems to be losing her inspiration. But her pieces, to their credit, do good jobs with creating atmosphere and setting the mood when needed.
Unfortunately, the only good thing I really salvaged from this show is the animation, which is beautiful and crisp thanks to being produced by A-1 Pictures, and they're steadily creating a name for themselves. Kudos to them! I also found another good thing about SAO: The English dub. I really respect the actors behind the English dub of this show, as they've ranged from being solid to incredibly amazing in this dub. Special kudos goes to Bryce Papenbrook for doing an awesome Kirito. He even made me choke up during the sad parts in episode 14, and not many voice actors can have that effect. I may hate the show, but I love its English dub (and also because I feel like anime fans don't respect most English dubs as much as they should, as there are other great dubs out there. Cowboy Bebop isn't the only good English dubbed anime out there), and all of the actors do a great job in it. In fact, the English dub is what made me go back to the show and watch the whole thing again (I dropped it at episode 6 on the Japanese version), partly out of a desire to get to know some of the newer actors on the scene, like Erik Kimerer, Christine Marie Cabanos, Amanda C Miller, Laura Post, Cassandra Lee (she does an awesome Suguha. Listen to her rant during the final Alfheim episodes, she nails it!), etc. and they're all great in their own way. But even that doesn't save the show from being as flawed as it is.
If you're looking for something that'll take you away from reality for a while, check it out. But if you want a good story with flawed, non-perfect main characters and a lack of blatant fanservice, give it a miss.",4

                This is the first anime I started following from its release to its finale, and having said that I can say this, I liked sword art online. Considering its flaws and a few oversites, it remained original and in a sense not overly ambitious. 
Personally, the main flaw was the speed in which the story line developed, much too rushed, this  lead to powerful emotions and important events crunched in 20 something minutes, sometimes and hour depending on the story arc. The story itself is good, the idea of it being somewhat ""Matrix"" like, in the way of being plugged into a computer with
                  the threat of death to your physical body is neat.
Regardless of the archetypal character structure there was some uniqueness and memorable quality about some of the main characters. I would liked to have seen some of the characters from season 1 in season 2; this could also be due to hastiness.
Overall, sword art online was a good 20 something minutes spent during the week, although it's just bordering on the average scale it still was quite enjoyable.",6
"
                Sword Art Online is perhaps the best anime I have watched in years and perhaps rivals my number 1 favorite anime. The characters were amazing, the music was amazing, the story was amazing and God I can't wait for a season 2 with the GGO Arc. The ALO arc was a little slow compared to the SAO arc but I cried like a baby and laughed so hard so many times during this show. I think the only show that made me react that way was Clannad and Clannad AS, and that is saying something. Please, please, please watch this anime and please post anywhere
                  and everywhere for a season 2 because this show deserves it!",10
"
                Aside from the fairly nicely drawn backgrounds, I cannot think of a single redeeming factor for this show. It's utter trash. It makes me feel sad to associate with the anime community as a whole. 
First Arc Review:
The story falls apart halfway through the first episode, and never pieces itself back together again. 
The pacing is the worst I've seen in any story ever and this includes the 2005 Fantastic Four movie. It jumps around all over the place, speeding through important things, while taking it's sweet time to slog though bullshit. It sometimes will just imply interactions that never happened, and leaves the watchers
                  feeling as though they are just watching a highlight reel of all the worst parts.
The characters are shallow and will appear once, never to be used again, leaving unused story threads everywhere. 
The main character is at some points emotional and friendly, and at others a neckbeard Mary Sue of the worst kind. We sometimes see glimpses of someone's better writing in the cracks in the wall of mediocrity that SAO is, like in the segment about Kirito's first guild buddies. Unfortunately, at all other times, Kirito is written as a perfect unstoppable force, only able to quelled by cheating. We're meant to believe that Kirito is flawless, his only failure being that everyone is just too stupid for him. We are then lead to believe that this socially inept, pompous douche manages to romance a rich, beautiful and talented girl within a matter of ~3 episodes. It's really just painful to watch unless Kirito is the kind of person that you aspire to be. 
Second Arc Review:
The second arc is better than the first, though that's not saying much.
The story, though not great, is more straightforward, and never feels like it's leaving anything out. It makes us feel like the things that happen in the show matter more than in the last arc, even though it's no longer a life or death situation.
The pacing in much more intuitive. Episodes pick up where they left off, and sometimes characters do come back to contribute to the story. There is a solid goal set throughout and one feels more reason to be engaged.
I cannot remember any characters from the second arc, aside from Kirito's sister, called ""Leafa"" in the game. That doesn't matter much, though, because Leafa is a pretty good character. She has a lot of synergy with Kirito, partially due to the fact that they are of equal skill and must work together to get things done. I didn't hate her, and that's more than I can say for Asuna.
Kirito is also better here. Though he manages to succeed in his goal of saving Asuna, hes not flawless in this game, and seems more human because of it. 
Overall:
Don't watch this show. If you do, pirate it. Please do not support shit like this. It only makes anime worse, and none of us want that. Thank you for your time.",3
"
                There are plenty of reviews for this show, yet I still decided to write my own. Mostly, because the majority of 'reviews' you see for this show aren't what I'd call actual reviews, they're rants by people who had their expectations disappointed, atleast 80% of them.
In this review I will try to set a few things correctly and actually try to highlight some of the controversy this anime is receiving.
As I already said, I've read plenty of the reviews written for this and the majority just disturbed me, as they aren't objective at all.
To begin I'd like to talk about this anime's biggest flaw. Oh
                  yes, it has a really big one and I think it's why there is such a vast number of people who dislike this anime. This flaw would be it's genre. If you started to watch SAO expecting a kick ass MMO styled action adventure anime, you'll find yourself disappointed and disliking the anime, unless you like anime's of it's actual genre.
So what is SAO's actual genre? Well you see, it's a romance drama, with a mmo adventure setting. If you don't like romance drama then this anime is not for you and you will not like it, end of the line. For those who enjoy romance drama this anime is great.
1. Story:
The story for this anime is great, perhaps not what some viewers had expected, but that doesn't make it any less great. Surely the setting of 'being trapped in a game' appealed to many people. As the story progressing, some people will quickly realize this anime is NOT about the mmo and it is also NOT about the protagonist fighting monsters.
It may seem to some people like there are plot holes and they'll think the time gaps are annoying. We have to remember though, that in an anime the producers have to cramp a lot of content into 25 episodes, so they only had about 14 episodes for the first arc. 
And again, if you expected to watch the protagonist slay monsters and find himself challanged, you're watching the wrong anime.
To those people who complain, that there are plot holes I can only say, that those things you consider the plot, are not the actual plot of this anime. The defeating of monsters and bosses, or the aquiring of new items is of little to no importance in this drama. What really is important is the relationships, friendships, losses and emotional hardships the main characters go through. Most people will consider a lot of the episodes in SAO 'filler' episodes, based on their own expectations. They want to see more MMO and more hack and slash action, well sorry to disappoint you, all you get is friendship, love, emotional turmoil and heart warming encounters.
That said the story is very nicely told. Unimportant aspects are left out and we get to watch the protagonist face emotional hardships as well as fall in love, make friends. Most importantly though, we get to see how his mindset changes throghout the story.
2. Art:
There is nothing bad to be said about the art of this anime. Maybe the monsters are a bit too mediocre, but they're far and above most anime still. With great scenery and cute and soft art this anime just is a feast for the eyes. Unless you like gore, then you're wrong here.
What I like to highlight mostly, is how well the art always fits the mood. 
3. Sound:
I can't even stop listening to the soundtrack of this anime ages after finishing it for the first time. The music is so well composed and it fits the settings and scenes so perfectly. On top of that the voice acting, sound effects and atmosphere are just brilliantly made.
4. Characters:
Kirito, the main protagonist, is a kind boy who happens to isolate himself a little and resort mostly to online games. He may not seem like anything special, but simply being kind and humble and caring makes him someone a lot of girls like. At times he may seem weak and even whimpy, but exactly that makes him so likeable.
Asuna, the female lead role, is quite the sophisticated and talented girl. Unlike other females in anime she's strong and doesn't slow the protagonist down or acts like a nuisance. She is slightly tsundere, which makes her really entertaining at times. Just like Kirito, she experiences hardships and good times in SAO and her mindset changes a lot.
Yui, Kiritos and Asunas 'daughter'. If there is anyone out there who doesn't like this character, they must be heartless. How can you not like such a sweet lovely girl. The story of Kirito, Asuna and Yui is probably one of the most heartwarming stories I have come across so far.
Klein. Yes, Klein. Oh he's such an important character. Many might complain how we don't get to see much of him, but the story of Kirito and Kleins friendship is perfect exactly like that. It shows how friendship is not about how much time you spend together, but that every time you meet it is like you've never been apart. Also, he's quite funny. 
Sugu, Kiritos cousin, is yet another spice to the love drama this anime offers. Of course you'd want to root for her, if it was not for Asuna, so she has to get her heart broken, but that doesn't make her lose heart in the end.  
Others. There are many other characters that are great in SAO, all of them exprerience the game in their own way and they have to deal with a lot of things, dramatic and good. All of the characters and their relations with each other are so well made, it's so heartwarming as well as heartaching.
4. Enjoyment:
If you've read this far it's not hard to guess that I have enjoyed this anime a fair amount. To me this is one of the most heartwarming and encouraging animes ever made. When I first started watching, I also expected hack and slash action, but I was definitely not disappointed, since I have a heart and it felt a lot of things watching this show.
5. Overall:
I would love to give this show an overall rating of 10, however that would be my biased opinion. This anime, realistically, for those who enjoy love drama, ranges between 7 and 9, depending on the personal likes and dislikes of each person. I will therefore give it a 8 for the sake of being objective, but in my own list it has a solid 9, because I just love it so much.",8

                Unquestionably the most popular anime of 2012, Sword Art Online rode a massive wave of hype in anime fandom. And yet as popular as it is, it surely divided the anime community on whether it not it truly delivered. And if you asked me if it did, my answer would be..... sort of? It's hard to put my finger on it, since SAO covered one of my personal favorite genres (MMO virtual fantasy), but came up disappointingly shorter than I expected. 
Story: 3
SAO starts off with a great premise of real people being trapped in an online setting. Then comes the infamous rule of ""People
                  die if they are killed."" That's right, you die in the game, you die in real life. It was interesting to see the social dynamics of this at first, and I waited with baited breath to see how our protagonist Kirito would progress through the series.... and then time skips happened. That is the problem with pacing in this series. We see no real progression, just an implied sense of one while Kirito walks around like a badass attracting every vagina in sight. We barely ever see him struggle and overcome, except for two climactic moments in the series where he completely disregards the science of the game in favor of deus ex machina strength. 
And then there's the second half of the series.... I can't say much without spoiling it, but lets just say the already shoddy writing takes a serious nose dive. All feeling of urgency is lost, and everyone just seems to be taking the game too seriously. It would be understandable if it was a real world setting or the prior virtual world setting where lives were truly in danger, but now it's just about a bunch of overzealous gamers pissing about. Other than the main female lead, who is now a generic damsel in distress, there's not much ado about the plot. 
Art: 9
SAO is definitely a very pretty MMO. I do have a problem with Kirito and most females looking alike with their moe faces, but the secondary characters are distinctive and well animated. The combat scenes are the biggest highlight of the show, and is a big step above its peers in the MMO genre.
Sound: 9
SAO also boasts very nice SFX along with a beautiful and memorable opening sequence. The Latin opera chanting creates a sense of epic grandeur during the major boss fights in the series. Yuki Kaijura has created a work of sonic art in this anime. 
Character: 3
Alas, the ultimate shortcoming of SAO. There is very little character growth with the two lead characters. The story written on their romance feels like it was written by a high school shut in that believed this was how romances worked. Females tend to be a huge minority in online gaming, yet they seem to be magnetically attracted to Kirito. Adding on to that, they have very little screen time and no character development of their own, and exist merely as fluff. It's almost as if Kirito is the ultimate wish fulfillment character for MMO gamers watching the series. And then there's the completely unnecessary love triangle in the second half.... Can you see where my frustrations are emanating from yet?!
The first villain played out very well, even if his true purpose in the game is not fully revealed. This is a big contrast to the villain of the second half, who is VERY aesthetically and characteristically unappealing. It's as if the writers ran out of ideas and needed to put in a bad guy that we'd love to hate without thinking too much of his overall impact on the series. 
Enjoyment: 7
I must say I did enjoy SAO in spite of letting me down where it really counts. It's just hard for me to take seriously because of the shoddy writing and poorly fleshed out characters. I can at least watch it for its combat and aesthetic eye candy (note there are some fanservicey moments, including one involving tentacles) .
Overall: 7
Should honestly be a 6.5 but I'll round up for good measure. It was good, just not as good as its fans say it would be, but not quite as bad as the detractors would say. If it had better writing and planned out more on its characters, SAO could've been an instant classic. Instead, it's just a beautifully animated action fantasy with a story that kind of makes me laugh at how someone could pass this off as a classic. But I'll take it for what it is.",7
"
                This is one of my first reviews, so here goes. This anime gets a 5 at best from me. This is why.
First of all, I REALLY loved the FIRST HALF of the story. It was full of action, and the whole kind of idea of being trapped inside a medieval game was designed to seem more original than it actually was... (AHEM, Spy Kids 3D, though that movie sucked.) 
Kirito was a fine character. If the anime revolved around just him, it would've been awesome. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Like every fantastic shonen anime, it had to be ruined by a sensitive, emotional girl
                  who couldn't do shit for herself and only got in the way most of the time. This girl, Asuna, wasn;t a problem at first. I figured she'd just be some kind of fighting partner with Kirito, but again, that wasn't the case.
In the second half of the anime, it started to go from ""actioney"" to ""sentimental"" and ""cheesy."" And that ruined it. The characters were the weakest point in the anime. I was really disappointed with their development. Most of them really got in the way of the actual storyline and just seemed superfluous to the anime altogether. 
The cheese got so overwhelming in the second half, I just had to drop it, asking, ""Where did all the action go?"" I was disappointed because this anime had a lot of potential. 
Overall Rating: 5",5
"
                This is by far one of the best anime i have seen in a very long time. I really enjoyed it. The storyline is captivating from the very first episode right up till the very last. The art is great and the characters are so very likeable. 
Overall its a great anime which i have nothing bad to say about.
Definitely recommend anyone to watch it !

                First ever review here and I wanted to start this thing off with SAO. I have read some summaries from the LN and other interesting things about SAO. I have also watched all 14 episodes so far and here are the breakdown of what I have to say about this anime adaptation as of Episode 14 Ending of SAO Arc.
I would also like to add that this review is for the sole purpose of the anime adaptation itself. With no regards to whatsoever are the contents of the LN.
But some comparisons might be added in defense of this adaptations limitation.
Story : It is narrated well,
                  although there are side stories you can clearly see the direction and the development of the characters and the story. With only 24 episodes listed for this anime I can clearly see why the story went so fast and some may say that it's not well paced. As for me, I enjoy every episode and conditioned my mind to remember where the story left off from the main storyline. The side stories are just icing on top of the cake. 
Score: 8
Art: Yes this is shorter than the story rating, no further explanations needed. :D
Score: 10
Sound: Opening is a pumped up song wherein if you have watched the first episode you will keep coming back for more. Ending song is well a mellow, slow, sad song that depresses you when every episode ends. Fighting sounds as well as other audio related stuff........
Score: 9
Character: This story focuses on 2 main characters all throughout the 14 episodes of the SAO arc so far. 14 for Kirigama Kazuto as the PR and 1/3 screen time for our heroine Yukii Asuna. Having a bad ass, kick ass, uber protagonist in  an anime during the first episode to a series is what kept me watching this show.  We can all agree that Kirito is so powerful but at the same time lacked the initiative to embrace the burden and the fame, almost all shounin anime though starts with the main being weak that gradually level up to become uber at the end, as for Kirito I can say that this is my IDEAL male protagonist for any Game related anime or online game, witty, dark, kick ass and uber. As for Asuna, well she's cute, a little tsundere and a badass type of character. All I can say is they make a great couple. As for the other supporting cast I can say good job for helping them clear SAO :p
Score: 10
Enjoyment: ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZ, I can type a lot means I enjoyed, watch anime to enjoy not to criticize.
Score: 10
Total Score 9.4 :D
I am soooo tempted to give it a 10 based on the fact that this is one of the 2 anime series that I look forward to every Sunday. Nevertheless it's not yet done so....... till next time.",9
"
                In the moment of writing this review I've watched first fourteen episodes, which make a complete anime. I don't know what's in later episodes, and I will watch them. But this is a complete story, and this story, within only 14 episodes I will rate.
It's amazing. NO series amazed me to that degree since... I can't even remember. The story is great. The characters are great. The sound is great. The art is great. EVERYTHING is freakin' great. When they want you to laugh, you laugh. When they want you to cry, you cry like you just lived the most moving moment in your life.
                  It's just... so outstandingly great overall, that I can't even describe it.
Watch it.
Watch it NOW.
But seriously. It's amazing. I can't think of any better way to spend those 20 minutes every time.
You know, when I was beginning watching anime (mainly from ecchi), I suddenly discovered Angel Beats. From not really funny series with no real plot nor drama I suddenly jumped to quite good, funny plot, which would make even me cry. I was amazed. Watching SAO was a similar feeling, even though I already watched all the famous series. It's just this good.
Update: I have watched some episodes the second series, Alfheim Online. And now I recommend you not to even check it out. It's horrible. Seriously. Don't even try. I can only mention those not to spoil you:
1. Kirito is unbeatable and totally overpowered for this to be fun.
2. Tentacle rape scene (yes, I mean exactly it)
3. Other dude raping Asuna in front of Kirito's eyes.
4. TERRIBLE character development.
5. Plot not making any damn sense.
Now I'm wondering how bad can second series of anime get compared to it's prequel. I really liked SAO and now I'm just dropping it because it bacame so horrible. As soon as Alfheim Online gets his own title on MAL, I'm going to rate it 1.",10
"
                Update: Now that the series ended, I decided to modify a little bit my review. It's still similar, but I have to recognize some improvement on the series through the second game.
Sword Art Online started with a strong premise and a really promising development at early episodes for what could have been easily the best anime of 2012 and even maybe become a classic someday. I have to say that I was utterly dissapointed in the early episodes (4 to 14), but found some peace with it when it moved on the second game (episodes 15 to 25). Why is that? I'll review SAO comparing
                  the two games, seeing their hits and misses:
First Game, SAO: Here we are introduced to Kirito, a character who has no real charisma, and although interesting and fairly well developed through the course of the episodes, he is not really a good lead for the series. He quickly becomes too powerful and so there is no real sense of danger around him after episode 4. The concept of a deadly game is interesting only as far as you sense there is real danger, and you only feel that during the first 3 episodes, and then briefly in episodes 10 and 14. So the concept of a deadly game is not really well developed, it doesn't live to its potential and that's frustrating. Also we have a handful of supporting character that matters little to the story plot and are only briefly developed, so their importance is questioned (not to mention the first real enemy we encounter, ""laughing coffin"" goes nowhere after episode 10). The real problem here is that there is no balance through the episodes, there a few very good ones, and some that feels like mere filler; and sometimes there's nothing wrong with filler when they are used to explore a brand new world and the make characters interact with it, but SAO has an incredibly slow pace that makes it too boring. The character that actually brings some charisma and makes you want to keep up is Asuna; she is a well developed and really more likeable lead than Kirito, and her relationship with him is actually pretty great as they are not only fit for each other, but also they grow found of each other in every episode, so their feelings towards each other feels really earned. I would say that SAO is more of a love story than a ""deadly game"" type of story, and it does a really good job on the romance, but when it tries to make us feel any sense of danger towards the leads it falls flat, so the concept of deadly game doesn't live up to its potential and drags the series down with the slow pace it has.
Second game, ALO: From episode 15 to 25, the anime became sharply better. By tossing aside the concept of ""deadly game"" and focusing on the elements that actually worked on SAO, the anime became a much better version of itself. Characters can now die in the virtual world without being actually killed in the real world. Some fans didn't like this, but I didn't mind because there was no real sense of danger to begin with in the first game, so by taking that away and focusing on the right elements SAO started a story with more likeable and better developed characters; for instance, the introduction of Kirito's sister, Sugu, was spot on, and also after game 1, Kirito became a more likeable lead. The supporting characters aren't toss aside this time, they actually have some importance to the plot; also, the stakes of the game are the mind of the players now, not their lives, which is much more interesting and better developed. The stakes feel more real now, because while we know our lead won't die nothing assure he wouldn't be controlled at some point or that he would fall middle way before the end, so it manages to develop the sense of danger that the series failed to develop in the game 1. Also, for the first time we can switch between real world and virtual world, we learn about how the game affected Kirito in his real life and his relationship with her sister, in a way that is both poignant and also a bit terrifying as Sugu confronts her love interest for Kirito (they are suppossed to be siblings, but they are not actually related, still the feel of incest is there and that conflicts Sugu, which is a more mature theme than most of what the anime initially aimed for and it is developed greatly). There are still some flaws around game 2: the pace is still slow until episode 21, and even though there is better work on the supporting characters they are still a bit boring and a bit flat, but way better than in game 1 for sure.
Summing it up: The first part of the anime starts great and then it has a huge quality fall down, but manages to pick up in the second game. It's really great how the reboot in episode 15 managed to fix almost everything that was wrong with SAO and develop the better elements of the show. The only thing I could have asked for it was for a better villian development in both game 1 and 2, and a faster pace.
Game 1 (SAO) grade: C+ or a 6.0
Game 2 (ALO) grade: B+ or 8.0
Overal grade: B or 7.0
In the end, SAO is an enjoyable anime; the first half is just fine, sometimes it's a drag but not a deal breaker, while the second part of the anime actually fix the many mistakes of SAO and only miss some improvements around pace, villians and supporting character development.",7
"
                First of all, I expected nothing less from one of the most legendary anime and most popular light novels. Almost all people that know anime also know SAO. Oh yeah, why I was attracted to SAO so much and felt it was because I am an MMORPG gamer as well. I can understand the world of this anime easily and I feel nostalgic, which is also why I found this anime so enjoyable. I already watched SAO before, but too fast and not in full so I rewatched it again slowly to feel the emotion of all the eps.
Story=&gt;9
SAO's story is so great. The story
                  is divided into 2 parts, eps 1-14 is Aincrad arc/SAO game part, and eps 15-25 is Alfheim game arc.
For Aincrad arc, its story is told around all events, circumstances, and conflicts that may arise in Death VMMORPG between people or even the gamer with the game itself. If you can image yourself to be a gamer of SAO, you will understand. Aincrad arc story is very straightforward, over rushed, and very compact because it isn't possible to tell all of the details about what happens at each floor in the anime. But still, despite it being over rushed, I found it so enjoyable and it touched my emotions. It really zipped in a wonderful way without removing the beauty of its story.
Art=&gt;7
Emm, I found this was SAO's weakness, and yes that is its graphics. For an anime that was published in this era, SAO's graphics are a bit bad. Well it's not really bad, but it can be improved further, a lot of anime around SAO have decent art and it's a little dissapointing.
Sound=&gt;8
Good, its really good. I enjoy all of SAO's OP and ED songs. They depict the anime perfectly. The back sound and sound effects are really good, it's really piercing when a critical moment arises in the anime. No complaints on this one.
Character=&gt;7
As I stated earlier, graphics is SAO's only weakness. Sometimes the chara design was not proportional and it annoyed my eyes. Chara depth was so good, also the important people around Kirito were usually told and wrapped into one episode for us to understand their feelings, we could feel their feelings, their point of view, and their anxiety, it's so good.
Enjoyment=&gt;9
Now I don't know what to say anymore. Just look at the number, it's 9. I really really enjoyed this anime very much and I think I wouldn't be bored rewatching it over and over again because this anime is so astounding. Maybe it's because I'm also an MMORPG gamer that I found this anime really attractive and exciting, but I think casual audience will enjoy it also as much as I do without a doubt.
Overall=&gt;8
Very very good, if only this anime had better graphic quality, I would give a 9 overall score. But still, this anime is the best!!
Conclusion
&gt;Pros
-Epic story
-Good music
-Fascinating enjoyment
&gt;Cons
-So so graphic quality
Anyway, after reading this review, WATCH THIS ANIME SOON or you will regret it. 
Long live all SAO FANS.",8
"
                Sword art online or most known as ""SAO"" is a really well known anime. It has good points to be known but honestly for me, this anime made a huge mistake that make me dislike it a lot after the first half of the show.  
So let's start with the good points. 
- Story (8/10).  It is a interesting story since they are going to live inside of a game. It is a unreal world that for who loves games (like me) will like this anime just for the plot. This is basically a group of players that got trapped in the game
                  named ""Sword Art Online"" and they have to complete the game to get out of there. If they lost their HP points they die in the real world. The all concept made me hooked throughout the first part of the show. 
- Art(8/10) Sound(7/10)Both the sound and the art are reasonable. We don´t have chances to see the detail in the action because there are few moments of action on this show. However when it has, we realize that it is a nice action with some detail.  The background is nice, and the characters are reasonable. They could just look better. But if we consider that they are inside of a game, we can acept well their design. 
- Characters(8/10). The main characters are good. The others .. well are all the same. For real, every one looks the same besides Asuna and Kirito. Their bahaviour is the same, everything looks like the same, except the design. About the main characters, we have a nice developement of both and their relation is really nice to watch and entertain as well. 
Now .. what about that bad point that i talked about? 
They rush the anime so hardly that we berely had time to see SAO. 
-SPOIL ALERT-  IF YOU DIDN´T WATCHED SKIP TO THE NEXT TOPIC (MARKED WITH "" --- "") 
When they move to a different game to save Asuna, for me the anime got a lot worst. The second half sucks for real because is the clichê end .. saving the girl from the hands of the bad guy. Besides that, they do not explore so well the game as they did with SAO which make a crappy action show. The only good thing is his sister and all the story behind it, but the rest... no longer is a survival game, no longer we see that pressure to win the game .. it just lost a lot with this change. 
--- SPOIL ENDED. 
So overall this is a good romance show, with a good drama and a beautiful story between the main characters. If you are looking for something to entertain, bet on this one. It's only purpose it's to entertain .. because besides that, it has nothing to show that we can´t see better in other shows.",7
"
                This is probably the best anime of the year. The plot is exciting with romance and adventure where you are going to enjoy it. Well, I'm thinking this anime full with suspend element and as far as the episode is going you might thinking episode 14 is the last. The author of this anime looks like pulling this anime high as tidse low as ground. You will love to watch it but its a quiet sad story after all and you will be expecting every episode with more excitement.  
              ",9
"
                Ahhh SAO.
You damn bastard who single handedly pushed the anime industry towards creative suicide.
The grandfather of all isekais. The one show i simply cannot find a single aspect worth of praise.
Stop lying, this show isnt average nor had a good start and you aren't special for going being a hipster about it.
Think about this: virgin otaku neet who looks like a model and knows everything there is to know about the world and is the smartest person ever coming up with revolutionary techniques to enrich himself in goods, fame or women. A lot of women.
Yes this damn description can be applied to 90% of the
                  isekais out there and even then the remaining 10% still find a way to suck ass somehow.
Why after millions of years of evolution our species reached the point of praising anything about this trash.
The first half and finale of the story not only are riddled with plotholes and asspulls but never make any sense since the story is simply an excuse to self insert in a power fantasy.
The only reason for the female characters to exist is for either fawning over the underage manchild of the protagonist or to be a damsel in distress.
I'mma be a hipster right now and say it. The second half of this anime was better than the first.
The story had a real villain with real motivations even if they were shit.
The story had a path to take even if it was extremely generic and was already done to death already, essentially the quest of the hero for revenge and to save his woman.
Yeah it was generic but it still was better than Kirito walking around with his massive dong because he's Kirito that's why. Because there was no other beta tester nor someone good at playing videogames, because he is the only gamer on the entire world.
Because people who come up with the mathematical damage formulas, drop rates and figure out the AI behaviours do not exist. Because people who make wikias do not exist.
Because Kirito as the entire gamer energy of the world inside of him.
The videogame world has no meaning nor a reason to exist if we never aknowledge it.
The only videogame references we get are some bs about some losers using points into non combat related skills because they are stupid. The entire point of the show is supposedly to win, survive and get out but nooo, they gotta upgrade their fishing skill, they gotta make those 50 fishing quests to get the golden fishing rod broooh.
Whenever Kirito encounters someone they inmediately go into a life or death situation and it's not because the game world is unforgiving and cruel and cheats you, it simply leaves you wondering how these pathetic bastards haven't died due to suffocation because they are incapables of taking a step for themselves without critically cripping themselves.
Also there is a shit ton of fanservice because Kirito is the ultimate embodiment of manlyness.
He is so manly that he cries like a little bitch after being cucked and it takes the clearly sexual advances of his cousing onto him to man up. I'm not joking this is essentially without spoilers the shit that happens. His entire arc of character development is banging a family member and becoming better after it, somehow.
Also while i don't think it's respectable to seriously add incestual elements to your story i can tolerate it, but what i won't tolerate is that every time Kirito meets a female wether its an underage child, a teen or an older woman they all fall for him and start following his every move. Eventually forming a harem konga march. And yes his fucking cousin joins that party.
And guess what. 300 years later this shit won't change. Because Reki (creator) has no clue how to write and to this day that i'm making this review not a single thing has changed.
A billion movies later, a trillion beach ovas later and 400 new seasons of SAO and the creator still has no clue how to make an engagin believable decently written story.
Don't  even get me started on the studio and directors of this shit, yes they suck ass and they tremendously water down the product to show the entertaining bits of it denying any possible world building whatsoever. 
Yes the original work has no redeemable qualities whatsoever but at some points it feels like it tries and those attempts at not sucking are always skipped in the anime adaptations.
The start is garbage. While some people are worried about the state of their lives for like 2 nanoseconds everything runs smoothly afterwards, Kirito even fucking walks away like he was walking home after school with all the chill in the world.
Not a single of the everlasting elements that the story has was present on the start and that's why people think the ""start was good"". No it wasnt, the ride wasnt even on.
It's like saying that the start of a rollercoaster ride wasnt that bad at the start when the start was the employee trying to figure out how to turn on the damn thing.
""Oh but it has won like 4 billion awards in Japan and the creator is more rich than Steve Jobs your opinion is wrong"". Well guess what. Japanese folks have a complete garbage anime taste.
Every single one of them is like an underage weeb of your country thinking DBZ and Naruto are the best. They love tropes and cliches and that's why so many animes feel exactly the same to others. That's why character archtypes exist in the first place and that's why subversion of the archtype is almost never seen, because they don't care about originality or innovation. So if you think like them that SAO is just an anime that receives way too much hate and that's really good then congratulations at least when it comes to taste you are pretty damn japanese.
The way Kirito powers up is never elaborated on so he is as powerful as the plot wants him to be. Literally the only person he ever struggles against is people who are above the game world rules.
The justification for his OPness is something extremely simple that anyone could have achieved even if they didn't know it was a secret. It doesn't require anything to achieve it's beyond basic. 
Kirito is fucking pathetic and a complete loser inside and outside the game but he is somehow special because he is the only japanese teen on the entire world who knows how to play videogames. So yeah.
Fuck SAO and fuck his tremendous popularity that killed anime, not that it was good to begin with, it just made it worse.",1

                Hi guys, and today I'm here to provide my review of Swort Art Online. So, because this is my first review, I'd like to explain how I'll do my reviews: I'm going to score into five categories: story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment. Then, I will give a overall score and my own thoughts of the anime. Now that that's out of the way, let's just get right into it.
*WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED*
Story 6/10
Sword Art Online is divided into two story arcs: Aincrad Arc and Alfheim Arc (also known as Fairy Dance).
                  
Sword Art Online started off very strong with the Aincrad Arc. The main character, Kirito, and many other players log on to Swort Art Online, a virtual game. Everything goes well, until one day, a mysterious figure appears and tells them that they are trapped in the game and that in order to get out, they must beat the game. One catch, should they die in the game, they die in real life. So, the story is very nice and starts off very interesting so far. The only criticism I may have is that there are episodes, even though it's the Aincrad arc, they feel like filler and just a bit out of place at time. Like, after some episodes, I was wondering what it had to do with the actual current story that's going on, if you know what I'm saying. Overall, it's a very good arc and I like the interactions between Kirito and Asuna. I'll also admit that I do feel like the story was a bit rushed, like I wanted to see more episodes of how Kirito leveled up for example. But, it's still a interesting story.
The Alfheim Arc is a continuation of the Aincrad arc. It's been two months since the Sword Art Online incident. Kirito continues his normal life since the incident and visits Asuna who has yet to wake up from her coma (spoiler: Asuna sacrifices herself in order to protect Kirito.) One day, he discovers an avatar named ""Asuna"" in a game called Alfheim Online and goes in to investigate and rescue her. In my opinion, this story arc is weaker than Aincrad because it feels like a repetition of the first arc. Get in the game, beat it, and get out. I also had problems with some of the character development in the story, but I'll get to that when I talk about the characters.
Art 10/10
The art is one of Sword Art Online's strongest suits. I just really like the art. It's very colorful and pretty to look at. The character design and animation is just awesome! I really can't find anything wrong with the art.
Sound 9/10
The soundtrack is amazing. I love both the opening songs: Crossing Fields and Innocence. I'm giving a score of 9 out of 10 because I thought the endings songs were good, but not like awesome. The music for the fight scenes is nicely timed and a great fit for the fight that's happening.
Character 4/10
The main character of Sword Art Online is Kirito. Now, many people don't like Kirito because they say he is overpowered and in a way, that is true. But, when Kirito isn't in the game, he's pretty weak. And I think that's what makes him special in a way. He has all this power in the game, but yet, he himself feels powerless and really weak because of the effects the game had on him in the real world. And you can see that because Kirito feels guilt after coming out of Sword Art Online and I guess you can say, he does have some kind of PTSD 'cause he gets flashbacks of the horrible things he had to do in order to survive. I guess what I'm trying to say is what makes Kirito special is the emotions he feels.
A second main character of Sword Art Online is Asuna. At first, I really liked Asuna because she was this strong female character and I've always wanted to see more strong female characters in anime. But then, she turns into a weak character in Alfheim Online. And I know I'm not the only one who has this criticism.
Now, another character that isn't in Sword Art Online, but in Alfheim Online is Leafa also known as Suguha, Kirito's younger sister/cousin. Her interactions with Kirito start off good as they are pretty much siblings, but then it turns into this weird, creepy love story. Suguha admits to Kirito that she's fallen in love with him. I didn't like that. I found it weird and creepy and just not right.
Then you have other female characters which Kirito encounters in the game like Ayano Keiko and Shinozaki Rika. I was disappointed that I only got to see them once in the game and that they didn't have a bigger role.
Now, the reason I gave a 4 out of 10 is because you don't get much character development, but I didn't really find that to be a problem. In fact, I find it ok that there isn't much character development because Sword Art Online is well pretty much about the game and story. To me, the problem was that every single girl that Kirito encounters, they fall in love with him and then it turns into this harem. And I don't really have problems with harems except for a premise like Sword Art Online, it doesn't really work.
Enjoyment 7/10
Despite its flaws, I found Sword Art Online to be an enjoyable anime. It's a guilty pleasure. The animation and well it's not so perfect story still make me watch it.
Overall 7/10
Sword Art Online is not for everyone, that being said, I still recommend this anime to those who just started anime. Is it the greatest anime of all time? No. Is it the worst anime of all time? No. And for those of you who say it is the worst anime of all time, I got a little challenge for you, go watch Superkids and then come back to me and you can tell me if it's still the worst anime of all time or not. It's an average show. If you're just looking for a good watch, then give this a try. Sword Art Online is also one of those animes that you'll either love or hate. If you're going to watch Sword Art Online, don't have high expectations. It's just a show to watch when you're bored or just looking for a good watch.

                Never in my life have I seen a show as infuriating as this. It could've easily been at least good, but it comes out as a total abomination. For everything it does right, it does three or four things wrong, and heinously wrong at that.
I suppose I should start with the one element I actually liked, which is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is from Yuki Kajiura, who I'm utterly convinced is incapable of making a bad soundtrack. The music is excellent, with the track Luminous Sword standing out as my personal favorite. The voice acting however, is nothing but pure cringe. No matter which language
                  you choose to watch it in, nobody turns in a particularly good performance, and it's incredibly easy to become as bored as they sound, and suddenly realize you have no idea what they're talking about. 
The most important element of any story, which is a strong cast of characters, is woefully lacking in this show. The main character is perhaps the blandest protagonist I've ever seen, with a large lack of consistency between scenes. He may be helping a bunch of Red Shirts for no discernible reason one episode, and then act like he hates everyone the next. The main girl fares no better, being nothing but the most generic of generic Tsunderes. The supporting cast is mostly made up of girls who have little to no character outside of their attraction to the lead, and thus they're completely forgettable. As for the villains, they get almost no screen time in their own stories. Particularly noticeable is the villain of the first half, who only shows up for about five minutes when not disguised. The villain of the second half gets more screen time, though I would've honestly preferred less screen time for him over what we got. 
The story is riddled with so many holes that I'm surprised any of it's left at all. The first half had the advantage of a decent concept, but it was ultimately wasted by terrible pacing, poor focus, and overall lack of vision. The second half suffers from all of that, but doesn't even have a decent reason to exist at all. 
The animation of this show is often praised as being great, but honestly I find it underwhelming. The only scenes I actually liked were the duels between Kirito and Heathcliff, because those were at least fluent. Aside from that, the animation ranks at early-2000's levels of quality. 
Finally, I should mention any other major points of where the show stands out. The points where everyone suddenly engage the idiot protocol and decide to act so dumb that they can't even pass for believable dumb people nearly had me throwing in the towel for how bad they were. The forced fanservice scenes are so horrifically forced that they're reminiscent of something one would see in a Studio Arms production. The second half of episode 13 is actually decent, and easily my favorite part of the show. Aside from those points, there's not much more that can be said from my end about this abomination.",1

                Warning, this review may contain spoilers.
First impressions: When I first got into this show, I thought this would be a good show. Oh how I was wrong!
Story: 3/10 
In the year 2022 humanity has managed to make  a completely virtual environment-welcome to spreading autism online!
The premise for Sword Art Online is pretty much a trapped in a video game world kind of setting with the twist being that if you die in the game, then you die for real. I would like to add that as a player of video games myself, I could easy relate and I thought it was a pretty cool
                  idea.
One problem I had with Sword Art Online was the romance elements which were a main focus of the story. Now I have no problem with romance being in this anime, the problem is the fact that the romance elements were poorly presented. One example is the romance between Kirito and  Asuna, even though it's shown that they care deeply for each over. However, the problem is because of the time skips in the show we really don't see the transition of how they fell in love in the first place.
Another problem with the romance element is that they also had a some semi incest romance with the main character,  Kirito, and his sister who is actually his cousin named Kirigaya. Now this part didn't bother me personally, but what did bother is the fact it was poorly executed with it being taken as nothing serious and just seems like it was added to just for fan-service. Which is a shame because they had some really good genuine moments in it and I feel if they took it more seriously it could have been very interesting.
Another problem I had with this show was the fact that this was a show that seemed like it wanted you to take it seriously. But I couldn't take it seriously because for some reason we have a harem in this story when a harem really wasn't needed in this type of story. And before you guys say that sword art online isn't a harem, I would like to state the sword art online is very obviously a harem show.
Another negative is also the fact they tried to add some video game to real life philosophy to make you take it more seriously and make it seem more deep and mature than it actually is. And while I was listening to this so called philosophy, I was wondering to myself what was the actual point of this. Because when shows in general have some sort of deep meaning that they want to tell you, they usually have some sort of point. For an example, for a show that has some deep meaning would probably be something like Death Note or Ergo Proxy and they pretty much told you their point fairly quickly if you are paying attention.
Now the next thing I would like to talk about is the narrative of Sword Art Online. The story line pretty much time skips all over the damn place. Also, it never shows you what is happening in the outside world while these people are trapped in this video game. 
Another thing I had a problem with is that, despite this being some what of a survival game, we really don't see much of the survival aspect of the story. We don't see many people die and this show usually only implies that people have died.
Characters: 2/10
The main character is just a bland Gary Stu who is over-powered, gets chicks, and make other men look like jerks.
The side characters are very one note. Also, these characters are the most bland I have seen in an anime to date. There is no character development. With all the shit these people had to go through, you would have expected some of these people to have major physiological issues, but they don't. There is no investment into the characters because of all the time skips.
The villains in this show are very one note as well. For villains in this show We have got the troll, a rapist, and a group of people who kill people for fun. So pick your poison
Art: 8/10 
The animation is just a godsend on your eyes. The backgrounds are done fantastically. The fights scenes are good. It also has some pretty decent CGI. This is a show you should see in HD if you can.
It has a pretty generic style to it and the characters design are ok as well.
Sound: 8/10
The OST  is great I could listen to the soundtrack for hours. The OST was composed by Yuki  Kajiura who has also done the OST  for Fate Zero.
The voice acting for both sub and dub where decent as well, but I  would recommend the dub.
Enjoyment: 7/10 
Now to Sword Art Online's credit, I can see that this anime had some great ideas for the story and characters, but didn't put it to full use. I love the fight scenes and the OST, but other than that it is pretty much bad in every other aspect. So I liked it but for very superficial reasons.
Overall: 4/10
So overall, this is a type of show that took style over content and when it tries to be deep and it ends up looking stupid. But the only positive I would say about it overall is that it's an anime that is very easy to get into, so it's a good entry level show for those who are new to anime. But if you have quite bit of experience with anime, then you will probably dislike this show for how much of a train wreck it is.",4

                It's not particularly hard to explain what Sword Art Online is about. I'm sure we have all thought about being able to enter a virtual reality world, showcasing the ability to play a video game. That is exactly what this anime is, a virtual reality world built around the design of an MMORPG. The major twist is, once everyone logged into the game, it was impossible for them to leave, equally if they die in game or forcefully try to exit the game, they would also die in the real world, through a design in the gaming console - the nerve drive. 
The story for
                  this anime was great, to start with; Everything was really well laid out and exciting through out the first series. You really connect with every single character, though they don't stick around for long most of the time. But this was mainly in the first series, Once everything hit the second series it kind of got less interesting and more repetitive. Not that there was not any change, just nothing major happened, the majority of the second series felt like a side story.
I'm trying hard not to spoil anything, But one relationship in particular in the second series was, quite honestly, really dumb, I didn't really care for any part of it. That is not the one thing i found stupid; A lot of the concepts and themes that are hastily explained don't make much sense and leave you wondering what the point is - Luckily I never thought about any of this while watching it. I didn't care that there was a few minor problems, I enjoyed everything about this anime through out.
That's all that needs to be said really. I have no need to explain how amazing the art or sound is, if you're watching based on the visuals and music; watch this anime, it has exactly what you are looking for. 
I'll dig a little into the characters, I don't want to ruin the characters impact on you, cause they had a large impact on me. The majority of the characters are perfect, I had such a strong mental connection with most of them, i wanted to see more of the secondary characters. But it's not all sunshine and happiness, as with most of the problems of SAO, the second series characters were worse than the first series. 
Overall, with all the stupidly placed, bad elements this anime has to offer, you would expect it to be a train wreck. That is not the case, it has easily become one of my favorite anime of all time, personally rated it's to the top of the list with a 10. But picking out all the problems it has if they really effect you, it rates overall as an 8; and this is mainly because of the second series. But still - watch this anime.",8

                STORY:
The story to be honest is reeeeeeeeeealy horrible,it's so unoriginal it's something you see often in a lot of anime,games etc. there aren't many twists in the story or intresting things that's happening that make me think about what's really going on in the story,a good example on an anime that does this good is Death Note, in Death note everything is well thought out and characters L and Kira climbs trough obstacles by mind games and actually thinking of solutions to a problem,but more on that later...
0/10
HOWEVER A GOOD ANIME THAT HANDELES THE WHOLE GAME STORY TYPE STUFF IS LOG HORIZON 
ART:
To be Honest
                  the art in SAO IS REALY GOOD I MEAN BRUH IT'S FROM A1 PICTURES THE GUYS THAT MADE MAGI.......
but still though art doesen't make a shitty anime good..
like how motion controlls doesen't make a shitty game good.
10/10
CHARACTER:
the character of Kirito is reealy dumb in fights where Kirito is involved all he does is swing a sword around and he wins everything...geez i fought naruto was overpowerd... LIKE LITERELLY THERE WAS A SCENE WHEN HE WAS TANKING LIKE 7 GUYS ATTACKING HIM AND HE JUST GOT MORE AND MORE HEALTH WITH NO TANK EQUIPMENT(YOU CANT TANK MORE THEN 5 GUYS IN ANY BALANCED GAME)
besides fights Kirito has noooooo characterdevelopment and Asuna isen't any better.
ENJOYMENT:Before i started watching SAO i heard sooo many things about it:that it felt like a game AND that it was the best anime ever..so i got excited but all those things were lies because SAO IS NOT AN RPG GAME AT ALL NO JOB SYSTEM,NO MAGIC,NO BOWS OR RANGED WEAPONS WHEN THERE ARE CLEARLY AXES,NO DUAL WEILDING(BUT OH YEAH KIRITO GETS DUAL WIELDING LATER IN THE STORY BECOUSE HE HAS THE FASTEST REXLEXES IN THE GAME)WHY WOULD YOU NEED THE FASTEST REFLEXES IN THE GAME JUST TO DO A SIMPLE RPG FEATURE
0..01/10
OVERALL SCORE:I WOULD RATHER GO COMMIT SUICIDE INSTEAD OF WATCHING THIS SHITTY ANIME AGAIN
ANIME RECOMENDATIONS:Log horizon:is a good version of SAO Better story and characters
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood:well if SAO 13 year old users recommend the shitiest anime ever and call it the best one then i might as well recommend the actual best anime ever",2
"
                I didn't see a lot of anime, and I am not a huge fan of the genre. Actually, I find it simply below mangas or manhwas in terms of immersion and character design, but SAO was the exception.                                                                   
                   
       Though it is true that the storyline is not great, and a bit shattered, when I compare this anime with things like No Game No Life, Geass Code or bryhindr in the darkness, I find that SAO is the only one that is True, and by that I mean the only one with characters I can identify myself with, and that is the most relevant quality for any piece of art in my opinion.
       People said that the two main characters were crappy, that Kirito had no personnality, and so on, but I think it is the contrary. Kirito doesn't speak a lot, he doesn't express his expression that much, but that doesn't mean his character is weak, and I find the little changes in his features much more expressive than the overreactions of other animes characters. 
       In fact, SAO is the only show (with fullmetal Alchemist) that I could watch until the end without feeling bored, and that made me frustrated when I found out that I had to wait for another episode, and that is why I rated it highly, even though I have not a ot of elements of comparison.
       Finaly, I would be glad to find a show that I can finally enjoy completely, so I ask the people that explained why SAO was a poor show what is better in their eyes, and then I will be able to settle wether anime is supposed to be lived (which I would prefer) or only watched (and then all the comments about the storyline and characters being poor would make sense to me)",9

                Sword Art Online is the most anticipated Virtual Reality MMO game in recent history and people are clamouring to be the first to dive into the virtual world inside the giant floating castle of Aincrad.  Advances in technology have lead to special hardware that allows the gamers to control their avatars with their minds, adding to their immersion into the game.  
The story of SAO is not a complicated one, but it was interesting enough to grab my attention mostly because I play MMORPGs and I quite enjoy them.  This puts me directly in the target audience for this show.  The
                  story begins with the successful launch of a new Virtual Reality fantasy MMO, and things immediately go to hell on the first day. The game's creator removes everyone's ability to log out and sets their gaming hardware to kill them when their avatar's hitpoints reach zero or they disconnect.  You die in the game (or tamper with the hardware), you die in real life.  The only way out is to conquer the bosses on all 100 floors of Aincrad (the game world).  The story concept isn't bad.  My only complaint is that it seems to derail itself almost immediately.  It hops back on track long enough to remind the viewer that people are being killed in this game before careening off somewhere pointless and coming back just in time to finish off the bad guy.  The romance portion of the story between the two main characters is at times the only thing holding it all together and even that isn't always enough.
The characters of SAO are a bit of a sore spot for me, specifically the two main characters, Kirito and Asuna.  The world of SAO had a lot of potential for some great characters, but instead we have Kirito who is about as plain as you can get.  He's a bad ass solo player who's more powerful than any other player in the game (which doesn't happen in any MMO I've ever heard of) and other than that, he really doesn't have much of a personality nor does he seem to develop one through the course of the show.  I understand that the reason was to make him easier for viewers to identify with, but that doesn't make it right (a certain series about sparkly vampires did the same thing with the main character and that wasn't good either).  As for Asuna, I really liked her when the show started.  She was a competent, capable female lead, but her character quickly degenerated to tsundere and then later to a plot device/tentacle bait by the end of the show.  The rest of the cast gets very little attention and only make brief appearances to move events along with the exception of Leefa, from the show's second half, who steps in to fill the role left open by Asuna.  Leefa, despite some glaring flaws of her own, was probably the one character I liked.  (who ever hasn't already stopped reading, likely stopped right there.)
The music for SAO was pretty good.  Yuki Kajiura composed the score and though it doesn't quite match up to some of her other works, it is still quite pleasing to listen to.  Each piece compliments the events on screen quite well be it a quiet melody in a darkened inn room, high energy percussion for combat scenes, or choir for epic raid battles.  I also quite enjoyed the opening theme, Crossing Field by LiSA, from the first half of the series.
The artwork and animation was quite good.  The character designs were detailed and pleasing.  The backgrounds varied but some were truly quite good and did an excellent job of portraying the vastness of the SAO world. My personal favourites were the platform landscapes in episode one and the free-fall scene in episode seven.  The action and combat scenes however, are where SAO shines. The fight scenes were executed very well.  The animation was fluid and though there were some slow-motion sequences, they were not over-used and did not take away from the excitement of the battle as they so often do.
My final thoughts:  
SAO is one of a handful of shows that has achieved an almost complete polarization of opinions among those who have seen it (and even a few who haven't).  I also realize that the current popular thing in the anime community is to trash this series.  The truth is that SAO is not a bad show, but it's not a great one either.  I enjoyed it mostly because it was a concept targeted to people like me who played MMO games.  I could get excited watching the boss raids, understand a lot of the terminology, and know what Kirito really meant when he said ""having someone good tag along makes this easier..."" 
Sword Art Online is kind of like the cheeseburger value meal at your favourite fast-food joint. It's not gourmet, it never will be, and comparing it to the main course at Chez Fantaisie-Pantalon is just plain pointless.  But that doesn't mean that it can't be tasty. I went into SAO understanding it for what it was, I enjoyed it, and I recommend it.  If you are an MMO gamer, or an anime connoisseur capable of putting down your Grey Poupon and picking up a chicken nugget, you will likely find some enjoyment in this show.",6

                SAO is a strange case in the anime scene. It's loved by many people, maybe even too much, but that's why he pays, as it is also bashed by those who think it is overrated and because of that classify it as shit, stuff for the newbies of the anime world. SAO has two faces: it is undeniably overrated by most of its fans, but it is also terribly underrated by those people who bash it because of that.
SAO is, in fact, nothing more and nothing less than a decent anime: enjoyable, with fantastic art and music, maybe a little stereotyped but overall something waaay
                  far from being horrible as it is usually said. It is far from being a masterpiece, just as it is far from being a piece of shit. Let's start analyizing the Anime:
Story: 7
In short, SAO brings us in the world of an MMORPG, the homonymous Sword Art Online. The fact is, when you're inside the game, you can't escape unless you beat the final boss of the game. To make things more complicated... if you die in the game, you die in real life. This is it, add some romance and some fillers and that's SAO. Sure it is not something you never saw before, but personally, as a gamer, this kind of stories always catch me, and that's what SAO did. If you don't expect to see the masterpiece SAO'll never be, you will enjoy it, particularly if you are a gamer and are used to that kind of things. Some episodes could be trivial (especially fillers and the first episodes of Elfheim Online), but it usually never becomes annoying or boring.It is flowing and enjoyable, and it has an happy ending, so take this bonus points. I'm personally sick of these depressed pseudo-deep endings.
Art:10
Simply amazing. Chara-design is awesome, the (few) fights that are there are ever better than most of the shonens where fights are everything and the World in which the story takes place is breathtaking. Something near perfect.
Music: 10
The music simply fits perfectly every moment of the anime. Serene and happy moment? Calm and relaxing music. Touching moments? Heartwarming music. Is that a fight? Music starts, awesome as the battle it accompanies. That's all, I don't think something could be better about the soundtrack, in this anime.
Character: 6
Here it is, the weak point of the anime. Characters. Well, Kirito and Asuna are both SERIOUSLY stereotyped, as is Kirito's sister with her useless puppy love, and unfortunately are most of the characters, too. But there's something that forbids me to give less than 6 here: Even if they're stereotyped, personally I developed affection towards most of the characters. There aren't obnoxious character, except the Villain because, you know, that is exactly his job. So even if there aren't characters like Vash The Stampede that you'll remember for ever, and ever, and ever, at least they won't make you want to break your monitor/TV to punch them. That's a point.
Enjoyment: 8
I personally liked this anime a lot. It is not a masterpiece and never will be, but it does what it must do: entertain you with a catching story, a wonderful world, music and art, nice-but-weak characters and an atmosphere that can be anxious and heartwarming depending on the moment, but it does its job. It can't do nothing more, but it doesn't have to. Just watch it, enjoy it, wish you were Kirito (...well, maybe only in Elfheim Online lol) and cry when you finish it, because yes, you will probably cry. In this, SAO succeeds. It could be better, but it is absolutely not bad.
Average score: 8.2
Final Score: 10
As I said, this is absolutely not a masterpiece. So why am I giving 10 to this?
Simple: this anime undeservedly took a deluge of bad votes and reviews for no reason. The only reason it has been destroyed by a large amount of viewers were his 5 minutes of fame when it came out, the horrible fanbase and the fact that by its fans is often considered one of the best anime ever (if not the best), when it ABSOLUTELY isn't. But this doesn't mean it deserves 2, 3 or 4, means simply that it is undeservedly overrated by most of its fans and for this reason... it is terribly underrated too. I mean, it's not that bad. In fact, it isn't bad at all. This 10 I'm giving is only supposed to bring some justice for all the undeserved bad marks this anime took. In a standard situation, I'd give to this anime a 7.5, but this is the situation and I hope people will judge this anime for what it is, and not for what his fans think it is. If you want a good shonen, here is SAO. Far from being a masterpiece, far from being shit. A nice, enjoyable shonen, nothing more and nothing less. 7.5 .",10
"
                Well, Sword Art Online was the first anime I watched and I was extremely hooked with it at the time as It was my first anime and on your first anime you think that It's the best thing in the world and you couldn't imagine liking something else, right? I'm pretty sure I finished the first season within 2-3 days on Netflix and was desperate for more, but I noticed something after watching Fairytail and Attack on Titan.
After I watched the 2 Seasons and moved on to more mainstream and non-mainstream ones, I realised that Sword Art Online wasn't very good at all, and I
                  wasn't sure why I liked it (Except for the Openings, as you've got to admit, the songs are very catchy!). 
So I watched it again and the more episodes it dragged on, the more I started to dislike it, I still like the characters and everything, but it's just that the whole Anime In general felt like it was just a bit repetitive and it ended up dragging the endings on to make them not very good. If the anime was around 12 episodes then I probably would of liked it more and would of given in a higher rating, but this has just dissapointed me, and this Is coming from someone who has watched around 8 animes, which is barely anything!",5
"
                I can't quite add much more to the show especially since I dropped it at 11 episodes, so I wholly admit that I may be biased in some case, and you're better off with the reviews from those who got to finish the anime. 
SAO's core plot of survival had a strong thing going for it and perhaps it had been done before in other forms, but it felt new and unique in how it was doing it. That announcement by the game master guy was quite intense, and I was wondering how things would progress from there.
I just wish Kirito was not the main
                  character. Most of the pacing from there and the characters feel like those in a fan fiction, with Kirito being a Gary Stu of ages. It's too much, and really get's into your face. 
I mean what happened to poor Klein for goodness sake?
At episode 11 I decided I couldn't take any more, because I ended up being able to guess most of the plot developments from a bit beyond that. The novelty and the great animation had worn out on me, and I wanted to call it quits.
My friend summarized what had happened, and I was convinced that I did not miss anything.
HOWEVER
There are much more terrible shows out there. If I pushed myself I could give it a 6/10, but I really don't feel that way at all. It took effort to watch, and that's just a bad sign in my book. 
ALSO
I'm not shocked that people could enjoy the show. I admit that I may be biased so by all means give it a try. However if you start to guess what happens next correctly, and wonder what the hell happened to Klein or many other side-characters before sir Kirito The Awesome One takes the spotlight, then I think we'll have some very common grounds of agreement.
I'd rather read a fan fiction of this show.",4
"
                Sword Art Online is one of those fantastically controversial animes that people either love to love or love to hate. Truly, it is deserving of neither the extreme praise nor the barrage of abuse it has thus far received. In short, it’s a popcorn flick.
The premise of the story was highly promising. Whilst not original, people being trapped in a game is an interesting concept, and for the first 12-14 episodes, I was genuinely fascinated by the world created. Game culture references were excellently integrated, and for the majority of the time, the world appeared believable. The soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura (the creative genius
                  behind the OSTs for Puella Magi and Fate/Zero) once again displays her talent for tension during some of the more intense boss battles.
However, when it came to characters and plausibility, the show began to unravel. The main character is an archetypal Gary Stu, hell bent on being the ultimate ‘bad’ good guy – tries to look cool, with an unnatural aura of perfection, yet helps anyone and everyone at every given opportunity. Side characters are introduced and tossed aside as if on a whim, with very few characters ultimately bearing any real significance. The 1st arc, that could have taken up 24 episodes by itself is condensed into 12-15 eps, leaving little room  for character development and turning many of the supposed ‘feels’ moments into something almost laughable. In this regard, I felt that the show needed to slow down the erratic pace in order to connect with me on any level whatsoever. 
Gripes with the series aside, the first 14 episodes were done surprisingly well and in spite of the one OP main and use of side characters, I thoroughly enjoyed the first arc of SAO. The same cannot be said for what I watched of the second…
Immediately in the second half, we enter into a nightmare of NTR, fanservice, incest and faeries. The personality of the characters, along with any vague character development is shattered in a series of panty shots and tentacles (I watched a scattering of eps across the second arc as opposed to the entirety in sequence). While I felt as though the show could have taken itself a little less seriously in the first arc, this went beyond anything I could have possibly dreamed of. The one dimensional villain, the loss of the minimal character development and the devolution into NTR, incest and faeries turned me off the series entirely, forcing me to drop SAO.
Despite everything however, I believe that the first arc is genuinely worth the effort, as long as you are aware of what you are watching. Is it deep and meaningful? No. Will it change your life? No. Will you care about the characters? Probably not. However, if light entertainment is what you desire and if you can avoid analysing the show in any way whatsoever, I can guarantee that the great animation and excellent soundtrack will provide you with what you seek.
##If you choose to watch SAO, I strongly recommend that you watch the first 14 episodes ONLY and leave the rest up to head cannon, because the second arc is truly horrid and will ruin what was otherwise a silly but on the whole enjoyable experience.",7

                (THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. LIKE MAJOR SPOILERS. SPOILERS THAT WILL RUIN YOUR WATCHING EXPERIENCE IF YOU KNEW THEM AHEAD OF TIME. So yeah, just be warned.)
Writing a review on an anime like Sword Art Online is difficult. It's difficult because no matter what you say, there will be someone who will disagree with you, especially if you say something positive about it. SAO is one of the most polarizing anime of all time, where you either love it to death, or you despise its very existence, with no real in-between. As you can tell by my score, I'm in the former category. However, even
                  as a huge fan of the series, I know that it's not perfect, as no anime is. Even still, though, I personally feel that people are far too harsh on the series, and I'll go over that in my review.
--
Story: 8
The plotline of being trapped in a video game is not a new one at this point, to be fair. Quite a few in the last few years have done this story before and after SAO, such as "".hack"" and ""Log Horizon"". However SAO is without a doubt the one that popularized it, and for that I have to give it credit for that.
What engaged me in the story of SAO wasn't the overarching story though, it was the smaller arcs. The ones that looked at the different people that were trapped in the game, and how they got by to the very end. Watching Kirito and Asuna's relationship develop as the show went forward made me feel so giddy inside, like no anime couple has before, and the fact that they get together early on instead of dragging it out to the end was so awesome to watch. Seeing each side character grow through their interactions with Kirito was enjoyable to watch as well, and I ended up liking each character we met. And I enjoyed the villains as well; Kayaba was so fascinating to me, seeing him try to create this world where he's in total control, despite so many suffering for it, all so he can fulfill that dream. And of course with Sugou, they created the perfect guy to hate. You aren't supposed to feel any sympathy towards him, and they make that perfectly clear early on, so that when Kirito whoops his ass, it's all the more satisfying.
Of course that reminds me, I have to bring up the the second half of the season, the ""Fairy Dance"" arc. Let me just say this to everyone who constantly bitches and moans about how this arc was so terrible and it should be skipped:
You're all full of shit.
You bring up how the arc ruins Asuna's character and makes her a damsel in distress. Fuck that. Asuna is still the incredibly strong willed fighter that she was back in Aincrad. Strength is more than just physical power, but psychological as well, and Asuna is a total champ in that regard. Having to put up with the Hell that Sugou put her through would break most people, especially considering he could force her at any time to like him experiment with mind control. Speaking of which, if she's such a damsel in distress, then what was that whole scene where she attempts to free the 299 other trapped players? Awesome it what it was.
Then of course there's the sub-arc with Kirito's cousin Suguha. People are so quick to judge this as being creepy incest, and yet completely miss out on how it developed her character. You have to understand her perspective; your cousin, who you thought was brother for most of your life, and has ignored you for so many years, is trapped and unable to be reached. Then while all this happening, you find out you two aren't even blood-related. Then after two years, he comes back, and out of the blue starts being nice and paying attention to you again. It's all so confusing to you, and to make it worse, your a teenager who in the most hormonally intensive period of your life. You try to escape these feelings that you know are wrong by playing video games, and in turn you meet this really cool guy. Finally someone you move on to, develop new feelings for, someone who... turns out to be the cousin you loved anyway.
Would that not fuck you up mentally on some level? And yet, in the end, they work things out, and Sugu is able to move on from these feelings because she knows how much Kirito loves Asuna. I'd say that makes for an interesting character.
So no, ""Fairy Dance"" is not as bad an arc as you claim it to be. It's not meant to be test of survival, but a race against time. The pace is meant to be different here than Aincrad.
If I did have to bring up any complaints regarding story, it would be the pacing. Not that its terrible or anything, but there are many points in the story that jump ahead in time, often months at a time. This can make the story feel a little rushed at times, and make you wish you saw what happened during that period of time. Perhaps if the ""Progressive"" novels get animated, we'll see what happened, but for now, that is a legitimate complaint I have.

Art: 10
While there are many aspects to anime that can be seen as subjective, technical aspects are not one of them. Be that I mean, technical related aspects to a show are purely objective since animation and sound is either good or bad, with very little in-between. Keep in mind though, I'm not talking specifically about art itself; art is definitely subjective since it's meant to come across in different ways and moods, and the style changing depending on who's in charge. So with keeping all that in mind, it's hard to think of how one can find fault in the art aspect of SAO.
There's really not much you can criticize here. The animation itself is incredibly well done, which is to be expected from A-1. The fight scenes are constantly moving and flowing seamlessly into the next. Yet when the animation is much calmer, it's pleasant to watch, with natural movements you'd expect to see. Characters never go off-model, which is quite the impressive feat considering how many action scenes there actually are. The art itself is also well done, with gorgeous detailed backdrops to see that are highly detailed in every scene.
--
Sound: 9
As mentioned before, sound being technical aspect isn't something that generally can be judged subjectively, with one exception of course, being the dubs.
As far as music is concerned, it's quite excellent stuff. It can range from peaceful melodies in town to epic choirs during fights, with each instrument playing off each other perfectly. And of course that theme song man. Even people who hate SAO can't seem to ignore the fact that Crossing Field is one of the badass anime theme songs ever. Although I will admit that the second opening theme, Innocence isn't quite as memorable, though catchy in its own right.
Now of course, I have to talk about the dubs. This is a battle that never ends well, so I'll just say this. The Japanese is of course fantastic, as to be expected. However the English dub is also surprising excellent too. Each character sound about how you'd expect them to, and the conversations sound very natural. The only point I'll bring up is on the lead of Kirito. Though I generally think that Bryce Papenbrook does a great job overall, he does tend to exposition scenes. Not a huge deal for me personally, but it's something I felt should be brought up.

Character: 8
Another very divisive area of the show is the characters. People either love the characters of this show, or hate them with every fiber of their being. I happened to like them.
I guess the best place to start is with the mains. Kirito sure does get a lot of shit from the anime community. People are constantly calling him a Gary-stu, OP, etc., so I'll touch on a few of those points. As far as Gary-stu is concerned, that's just bullshit. Kirito is not a perfect individual, far from it. He's bull-headed, rushing into situations without thinking often, especially in regards to Asuna. He's also a bit of a loner, at least for much of the first half, and this only becomes exacerbated after the death of the Moonlight Black Cats and Sachi. But you know something? He moves foward, he develops. Yeah, that thing that many of you claim Kirito never does happens right in front of your eyes. When he builds a relationship with Asuna, it helps him to become a better person, to open up more. Also, in regards to the whole Gary-stu accusation, I didn't know that being a nice person meant being a Gary-stu. So he's nice to the people, and in turn they become friends. HOLY SHIT WHAT A SHOCKER. And yes, this applies to his female friends too; god-forbid girls like him because he was nice to them right?
As for the OP argument, in a sense, I could agree with that. He does have his OP moments, but it actually makes sense in a way. Kirito is a power-gamer. He would spend hours a day growing up playing video games, probably a lot MMO's. Is it so hard to imagine that he'd be really freaking good at them? And the funny thing is, he admits this in the show itself, during episode 4, where he points out that the way MMO's are designed makes it so that some people are naturally better than other players.
Now when it comes to Asuna, I'll freely admit I'm a bit biased here, since she's one of my favorite anime characters of all time. She's kind and sweet to the people she cares about, but when push comes to shove, she can be badass herself. And I love how she develops as a person going from feeling hopelessly alone and having to force her way to survive, to finding hope and a reason for being though her relationship with Kirito. And I mentioned before about her role in Fairy Dance, so I won't bring up why she's great there here.
There are many side characters that develop throughout the series that would take up too much time to mention. However, if there is one complaint I do have when it comes to characters, it would be that many of them don't get much screen time. Many will stay relegated to side characters most of the time, which to be fare they are, but characters like Lisbeth and Silica got their own episode, but not Klein or Agil, who are the two other male characters besides Kirito that have any significant presence.

Enjoyment: 10
Enjoyment is something that is entirely subjective. You can find something terrible but enjoy it in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. Or you can see the brilliance in a piece of work but not enjoy it yourself. For me though, SAO is something I enjoyed from episode 1 to the very end. I found myself becoming so emotionally invested in the story that the show had built, seeing these characters develop their relationships that I came to care for them like real people. I loved watching the badass fights and relax to the quieter more subtle moments. I laughed at moments of humor, and felt shocked by the twists. It was a roller coaster ride that I loved every second of.
--
Overall: 9
Like I said in the beginning, SAO is not a perfect series. Even as a huge fan, I get that, and I totally get that some people just don't enjoy it. But I really feel that it's a disservice to say that it's ""WORST ANIMU EVA 0/10"". That feels like you letting it get you riled up and not looking at it from a more clear minded point of view, one that doesn't let bias get to them.
SAO is not something you should just ignore because it has a massive bandwagon of people against it. Clearly it's found an audience of people who enjoy it, such as myself, especially for it score so highly here on MAL. So please, if you've never seen the show, give it a shot. You may find that you enjoy it yourself.",9

                       After Log Horizon finished its first airing, I had been wondering virtual reality anime for a year. When I was about to give up hope my girlfriend recommended Sword Art Online. When I saw her text the Online part of the title really gave me confidence that this was going to be the anime I was looking for. It was.
       Everything is top notch about this anime. The romance, action, and even drama. The logic in the whole virtual reality thing is what made it more believable. Not only that, but the
                  mechanics in the game are amazing. The menu, friend request, clan request, etc. This anime has everything you could thing of.
        I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a good action and romance packed anime. 10/10.",10
"
                As well as for most of this community, Sword Art Online (which I’ll be referring to as SAO for the rest of this review) was the anime that got me into anime. Despite its enormous popularity and fanbase, SAO is by far one of the most harshly criticized shows of recent years, which is an injustice in my opinion. I’ll be explaining my reasoning behind my liking of the show throughout this review to try and explain what makes SAO so popular among casuals.
The main reason me and many others have enjoyed this show is because of the appeal. The idea of the VRMMOs are
                  nothing but genius since it mixes real life interactions with RPG mechanics and enhances the sociability of gaming, which is still a lacking point in games today. The mechanics of SAO (game), although not as flashed out as I would like it to be, are very plausible for an MMO and also very entertaining in their own rights.
Character-wise SAO has a very diverse cast of unrealistic cute girls with stereotypical behavior and a OP main character which the girls depend on for the entirety of the show. Although this may sound bad, which it is, it also makes it so the show has more time to explore the vast virtual world instead of wasting time developing a cast that, honestly, only needs their physical traits to shine. Also, it is important to remind that developing a character also makes them dislikeable and is a risk that the author chose not to take. Kirito is the dream figure of every male teenager and, as such, contributes greatly to the narrative and appeal.
The SAO production is nothing to make fun of. The animation is top notch and every action scene is well directed and memorable. The soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura, although not closely as good as her past works with the Type Moon series such as Fate and Kara no Kyoukai, still is an amazing atmosferic masterpiece and translates perfectly the vastness of the world and epicness of the story. 
SAO is far from being the best thing ever made but even further from the worst. It is a cheap and safe attempt at making a fun and entertain show, and it succeeds in that aspect. Enjoyment is still a key factor to whether or not a show is worth watching and, taking that into consideration, SAO definitely is.",7

                How to describe an Anime like Sword Art Online? A tough one considering how many levels it reaches as far as Anime goes. I'll start off with the basic plot. Although the plot itself may seem very simple, the characters are what really drive this anime. The plot is still very intriguing though! The fact that ten thousand players are stuck inside this virtual world and cannot escape is a very interesting storyline which is easy for a watcher to follow without any complications. The artwork in this anime was phenomenal! The detail that was put into the background and scenery was mind blowing so
                  you could definitely tell that the designers took their time. Out of all the anime I've watched over the years, the soundtrack in this show was beyond anything I was expecting. In every situation, the music made this anime that more real to me which made my experience that much more enjoyable! Character developments were key in this show and each character shone in he/she's own way. There wasn't a character I absolutely despised. Overall, I believe anyone can enjoy this anime. Whether you like action and fight scenes or romance and comedy, this anime can be enjoyed by all audiences!",9
"
                All right. I didn't want to waste my time writing a review for an anime that not only was released a few years ago, but is also hated equally by so many people that this will just be an echo of those past reviews with thousands of votes. But, unfortunately MAL wouldn't allow me to recommend SAO and Utsu Musume Sayuri (with a very convincing argument as to why those two are similar, if I do say so myself), so now I feel inclined to write a review just to get my two cents out there. If you hate this anime too (gold star for
                  you!) then, again, this will just be an echo of what you've already read, but I encourage you read it anyway. Why? Because those of us who see SAO for the beaten dead milked cow it is should really stick together. I'll keep it short and sweet.
Story: 1
Where to begin... Almost everyone, whether they hate or love this anime, can agree the first two episodes were decent. I personally enjoyed episode 1. It introduces some promising characters, reveals a colourful and unique setting, sets up a plot of some sort, and ends with a spark: The antagonist has trapped real people within his virtual game and these players must reach the top floor of a castle to survive. And from there...the 90 degree drop. By about only episode 3 (count 'em, THREE) we've jumped ahead two years and thousands of players have died. Already this leaves viewers wondering why they should continue watching. The value of the spark, that players' lives are on the line, has been destroyed. If thousands of faceless, nameless, story-less characters have died, then why should I give a shit about what happens to those with a face, name, story? They'll probably die too. That or, worse, they'll be doted on like some rich spoilt kids over the servant children. It's not a requirement for a writer to make every character realistic, but to set up a plot that involves many characters only to kill them off without so much as a reaction from them or a glimpse of who they were is just lazy and again, it ruins any value the story had.
Art and Sound: 4
I placed these two together because they're both the only okay bit of this anime. And by okay, I mean they're not as horrible as the rest of it, but they're certainly nothing to praise, either.
Characters: 1
Just like the story, the characters are lazily written.
Kirito: He's the main protagonist who can do anything and everything. He can fight, he can lead, he can hack the very game he's trapped in (but not use his powers to escape?) he can make all the cardboard males want to be him and all the cardboard females swoon. The only time I'd care about a character like this is if /I/ wanted to be him, and I don't. Same goes for all viewers who do not want to /be/ your protagonist. A blank slate means nothing to them and is, therefore, not interesting or worth their time.
Asuna: One of Kirito's many cardboard girlfriends and the only character I've ever seen REGRESS rather than DEVELOP. She started off strong. She was leading a guild, planning battle strategies, fighting on her own as she figured out how to storm the castle and survive this game. But then Kirito came along, and like some blank slate black hole, he sucked the character right out of Asuna and turned her into arm candy to go along with the rest of his collection (one of which being his cousin later on. Wow.)
To elaborate on these arm candies (cardboards) a bit more, none of them are really memorable. There was a girl at the beginning whose name began with an S. She was scared of death and, what do you know...she dies. In about three episodes no less. Then there was the blacksmith girl. I don't even remember the first letter of her name, but she fought a dragon with Kirito, fell in 'love' with him in one day, then was upset when Asuna showed up. I'm guessing I was supposed to feel sorry for her. It takes a lot for me to like actual human characters with human qualities, so for me to give any care about your cardboard girls, SAO... E for effort I suppose. There was some girl with a pet dragon which dies in about five minutes and there's a big deal made out of that. So, again, I'm supposed to feel sorry and sad about something I've not connected with. There were a few other girls mixed in. Most of them only lasted one or one and a half episodes before they were gone (and then reappeared in the end, as if I'm supposed to care about them when they had zero screen time, personality or story at all). The villains are a lot like the arm cardboards. I don't know how drunk the writer was to make a mountain out of something as tiny as not even a molehill. More an anthill. The first villain created this castle because it was some sort of dream of his...but he forgot why. How do you scheme up a plan that involves trapping thousands of people within a virtual game, KILL some thousand of those people, then forget your reason for doing so? It's...almost as if SAO didn't want a villain at all. As if SAO's only purpose was to trap Kirito and Asuna together for fifteen or so episodes so they could have a reason for them to fight to be with each other again for the next fifteen or so of the second bit of the story. Speaking of the second bit, the villain is far worse. He wants to marry Asuna? And he licks her tears? And traps her in a cage? Add an old janky filter over this bit of the anime and you'd have yourself a proper snuff film.
These are the BAD examples of protagonists and side characters. Good examples have flaws. Insecurities they need to face, fears they allow to hold them back, obsessions that lead them in the wrong direction--something, or sometimes many things, that readers/viewers/etc can relate to and overcome as the protagonists fight and overcome these obstacles as well. THAT is what makes characters interesting and worth my time to laugh about or shed a tear or two for. Look at your predecessors, SAO. Full Metal Alchemist, Code Geass, Cowboy Bebob... They all have interesting premises, a knowledge of how to execute said premises, relatable characters with flaws or obstacles that actually get in their way that they have a chance to overcome. These anime actually take viewers on a journey with many different twists and turns. You leave me in one place, and most of the time it's with two of the most repulsive characters I've ever seen (and I've seen some weird characters. Remember Utsu Musume Sayuri above? Your characters are worse than those...things.)
Enjoyment: 1
I know there's not much of a grey area when it comes to SAO. People either praise the fuck out of it, or curse the fuck out of it. If you've enjoyed this anime, fine. But I can't enjoy something with so many plot holes, deus ex machina, just lazy ass-pulls that ruin the whole story. I'm not the romance type, but I know you screwed even that bit up. It's just two teenagers testing the waters of 'love'. If I wanted to see that I'd go back to high school. F - -, SAO. And somehow you have a sequel, a bunch of specials, (and a movie now too I think? Let this milked cow die.)",1
"
                Sword Art Online is easily one of the most overrated anime out there. Sure, the first few chapters are indeed enjoyable but if you want something that won't leave you feeling like you just wasted a bunch of time, then do not watch this.
The characters are simple and boring, with no development whatsoever, the main ""girl"" seems refreshing from the usual love interest but ends up being exactly that. Kirito, the main character, is so annoyingly overpowered, and every other character is just there for fan service and are extremely easy to forget, except, of course, for the main character's child, who appears out of
                  nowhere and just adds to Kirito's annoying powers.
The art style is boring and nothing out of the ordinary. The animation is good, but there's only so much you can do with such a generic style.
The sound is the best thing of this anime, it is enjoyable and adds a sense of excitement to what, in any other situation would have been boring.
My final statement is, this is a dreadful anime, do not watch it if you want something other than fanservice.",1
"
                *Disclaimer: I am reviewing the dubbed version of Sword Art Online.
I'm going to go ahead and get this out there, I am a SAO fanboy, and a dubbed fanboy at that. (Not that I think dubs are superior, I just started with dubs and prefer dubs) So obviously this review is super subjective, but an opinion is still an opinion. With that said, I would like to see if I could let you in on why I love this anime so much and it became arguably my favorite anime of all time. I met SAO early in my anime life right around the end of
                  July 2014. Before then the only anime I watched (which I didn't even know was anime at the time) was Digimon, Pokemon, and Naruto in my childhood. So you can say SAO was my gateway anime, so maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much. Regardless, now onto the review.
The Story
The story has two arcs, which I will not name to avoid spoilers. The first arc, in my opinion, is personally my favorite arc in any anime of all time. It's filled with tension, anxiety, depression, happiness, love, guilt, fear, courage, and valor in a thirteen episode span. The first arc (I believe) is what made the anime so popular. The second arc slightly suffers from some awkward tensions, but is still great overall. Overall, its a very solid story about the journey of Kirito in the virtual world.
The Art
I would not call myself an art critic to say the least, but personally I felt like they hit the nail on the head. When it wanted to fill scary it felt scary, when it wanted to be beautiful it was, when it wanted to be intense it didn't disappoint from a visual perspective.
The Sound
I consider sound two fold, the general sound of the anime and the voice cast.  Without the preconception of watching a sub beforehand, I came into it with no preconceived notions, and I feel all the characters voices fit them very well. They are filled with emotions when they need to be (especially Asuna and Kirito) as well as sinister, in the cases of the villains. In terms of general audio my best uneducated opinion is that the sound effects were realistic and on point (ex. sword clanging, running, etc.)
Character
I love Kirito. That is such an established fact about me that my brother bought me a Kirito figurine when he was in Taiwan. (Which is actually beside me right now). He is caring and funny, but also is human, having to deal with fear and guilt. He also has a knack of building a harem. 
If I had a waifu, it would be Asuna. She is sweet, kindhearted, gorgeous, and strong-willed. She balances the seemingly overpowered Kirito well, not to mention she doesn't get stepped all over as their relationship develops.
Shout out to Klein and Agil, there legit. The rest of the cast (the harem essentially) is nice and well balanced, but isn't revolutionary in any way shape or form.
Enjoyment
As it was my first true anime, my enjoyment was through the roof, I know I've re-watched it at least twice (the first arc at least) just to get the feel of nostalgia back. This was one of the most pleasurable experiences I have ever had consuming any form of media in my life. I am loving SAO II right now, but nothing will ever compare to the orignal SAO.
Overall
Sword Art Online has solid story, great art, good voice acting, fun characters, and is very enjoyable overall. If your still reading this super fanboy rant, congratulations! I hope you have as much fun watching this anime as I did.",10
"
                so where do i start off with this one. I started SAO at a time where anime was still new to me. My first impressions were really positive to say the least but i couldnt say this any further for the series as it progressed. Let me start by saying SAO has good concept but has an execution of a little bitch called George The characters are not relatable and above all is just straight forward typical to any other characters you encounter in a shit anime. 
Kirito is just like the writers dream of what he sees in his wet dream . Zero fucking
                  footsies and has no game to get chicks but he somehow sleeps with every one of them. 
Asuna is just another bitch that shows how a whore starts the day off. I mean no logical thinkers in this anime. What pisses me off even more is the so called plot twist that till this day noone gives a fuck about or cares. 
Overall I think yall should stick with coon fighterr or watch some ddecent shit like log horizon or even fking school days is better than this shit. 
PS : This is not a fking troll review , yall better take my advice or GTAB",2
"
                No one gets it. I heard many times SAO is wasted potential, but that would make our dreams and fantasies wasted potential then. SAO carries the pain and backlash of haters because it's wish fulfillment. If it was some child Disney movie I would understand, but SAO got some great action and romance to go with it. Have some fun, better than to watch unhappily.

                SHITTY REVIEWS
-shamelessly presents-
Sword Art Online(Sub)
**SPOILER FREE**
I did not know about Sword Art online until recently.I watched Accel World and DanMachi before this.So everyone said that I will like this definitely.
I have not played any MMO but I am anime watcher who watch them for enjoyment.So WTF is SAO?this review  will try answer that.
Story(7/10)-I thought the story would be actually descent.and it was descent even through the idea was not very unique still they manage to make stay till the first half but then they dragged the story made it overdramatic with shitty vilain.
If only the second half was not there.... then this show would
                  have received more praise.
Art(10/10)-Like the third most popular anime on MAL attack on Titan. SAO has some really gorgious visuals.the background sceneries are just amazing.
the action scenes are also great.
Sound(9/10)-Voice acting was good but nothing special.
the soundtrack is really great. it increases the fun when combined the beautiful visuals.
Characters(7/10)-First thing first Kirito is not VERY OP.other than that Asuna is good waifu material and the chemistry between her and kirito is awesome.
the sister is annoying at places bit still okay.other side characters were okay too.
Enjoyment(7/10)-everyone said that if I liked DanMachi I will Surely like SAO.
they were DanMachi is WAY BETTER THAN SAO.plz watch DanMachi before watching SAO it is only 13 ep long and has a way more interesting world that the ones in SAO.
Overall-recommended for-anyone who liked DanMachi.
not reccomended for-those who hate OP MC and bad writting",7

                Adapted from the  light novel series written by Reki Kawahara, Sword Art Online provides viewers with something special. SAO is divided into two archs - one of which is much better than the other. It is the first half of SAO that I will review to the fullest and why I have scored this animation so high. 
Imagine the psychological trauma a person would face when they realized that the virtual reality game that they planned to spend a few hours in turned into a few years. The shock of being trapped within a death game with no way out except to fight would
                  be enough for people to commit suicide - this is exactly what viewers see in SAO. The anime does a phenomenal job capturing the mental state of the characters as they settle into their situation for the long run. The most enjoyable character is definitely the main character Kirito. The audience has a wonderful opportunity to see Kirito being a completely normal person and taking advantage of his advanced knowledge of the game from beta testing to get ahead of other players. His selfishness turns into such shame that he feels that he must survive alone in this world without help from others. 
When Kirito does find a small group of people, it's not long until he gets them killed. Although his intentions were not malicious, his in ability to act causes his team's death and a team leaders suicidal fate. It is at this point that the dark emotion really starts to set in. Kirito rages on for months trying to find a path to redemption for his actions and yet it doesn't come easily. It isn't until Kirito meets with a character from earlier in the series, Asuna. A beautiful and capable young women who was traumatized in the beginning and yet worked to be atop a guild. Kirito emotionally moves Asuna when he shows her how to ""live"" within the game. This aspect is another well defining theme for SAO. After the psychological trauma dissipates, the characters start to ""live"". They get jobs, buy homes, make friends, and make a life for themselves - it's intense to see because I believe this is exactly what would happen. People have a tendency to make the best of something after the shock and depression drift away. 
The relationship between Kirito an Asuna is great; it's mature, authentic, and warming. It may be a little light hearted at times for some viewers but I think the animators captured it well considering how young the characters are. Through the last few episodes of the remaining first half, Asuna and Kirito rely on each other very seriously which strengthens the love that they have for each other and further legitimizes their marriage. 
The action in SAO is great, lots of sword play, fast paced actions, and an OP main character. If you are looking for a series that has a bad-ass main character who can solo a death game, pick-up the hottest and most capable girl, and beat the odds in humbling fashion then don't miss out. 
There are a few problems that I had towards the end. The first is that the second half should have never been created - I won't go into details, in fact, I recommend only watching the first half so that SAO stays untainted for you as a remarkably ingenious piece. The second is that the mature relationship that takes place in SAO is much less in the real world - why? In SAO the two characters specifically address how real their marriage and relationship is despite being in a ""game"" - it's still there but it's much lighter than I would of like it to be. Lastly, I wanted to address that there are critics who speak about ""overused"" lines - this may be the case...however, it doesn't matter to me. There are some things that have already been said best and they work every time - their effectiveness gets me every time. You will have to watch SAO to see what I mean! Have fun!",10

                I am writing this review to try to explain in my own opinion that the reason this show is good even if has a lot of problems that regular anime try to avoid, it is because Sword Art Online in itself is a special case trying to prove something different from most anime, and the criteria used to judge whether or not it is good should change just because of exactly what Sword Art Online is trying to show to the viewer.
I also want to point out that Sword Art Online is a Light Novel series and really as an anime should be judged in
                  consideration that it is adapted from a novel and wasn't an anime first. That already is something that makes the situation of this anime special because it has to make a novel with pictures into an anime with a coordinated soundtrack, voicing, art, character development (without lots of monologues or written information to help do this), and do all of this while trying to stay true to the original point of the novel series.
This is why I am judging Sword Art Online based on the following criteria:
1. What is SAO trying to say?
2. How is SAO trying to say what it is trying to say?
3. Did SAO say what it is trying to say?
4. How realistic are the characters and the world that have originally described in the light novels and does the anime preserve the same conception of that world and make it enjoyable?
5.How story art, sound, character, and enjoyment all are overall.
First of all, Sword Art Online exists in season 1 in order to make two large points: 1. How you are in a game reveals something about your personality in the real world as well. 2. Games aren't all that different from the real world.
These two ideas have a lot of thought-provoking consequences. If playing an online death game, makes you feel as if you were going through the same exact experiences in the real world as in the virtual world. If you were to have your life saved in such a game and to live with other people in a dangerous place like this for a long period of time, then not only will your personality change as it would have changed if you were in the real world experiencing the exact same things, but also how you act in this world will reveal about who you are as a person if no rules or government except some basic programmed ones (from the game creator) are there to stop you from just arbitrarily killing other people.
In other words, this game not only examines how people stranded in an exotic world/place would try to act when trying to survive or trying to escape, but how they would go about either stabbing each other in the back, or working together, or leading their friends to their demise and feeling guilty.
In the end, this novel is about what happens if society starts from scratch from a group of gamers in an exotic world. What would the people do, how would they act, and would they want to escape this world, or stay there because it is so interesting and ""better"" than the real world.
What I am trying to say here is this: This anime isn't about Guys/Girls liking each other and feeling lovey-dovey just because one of them is hot and the other one of them is cool, it is rather a novel series/anime about the social dynamics of a deconstructed government, the character development of a deeply emotionally scarred set of individuals living in a socially deconstructed environment, and it is also an anime pointing out some of the possible consequences of using virtual reality technology, and some ways to try to overcome these consequences.
In very simple terms: are humans monsters or good guys? What will they do if no one is there to tell them to behave nicely. What if they have no homework? Are they going to go to see their parents or do other things? What is the difference between concepts in the real world and the virtual world, like marriage. The list of interesting ideas goes on and on.
Now that's just the framework for what is going on. Everything that happens has to do with these ideas. But realize this is an anime. So instead of thinking about these things expressly when you are watching the episodes, you can be watching fantastic boss battle fights for people struggling to protect each other in order to beat the game and save all of their friends inside of it. You get to hear amazing soundtracks while watching breathtaking visuals and a large, fantastic virtual world.
Since Sword Art Online isn't trying to develop a whole world with a huge list of characters inside of it in which you know everything about all of them, it not only has time-skips but it can tend to focus on the development of only a few of the characters in a significant way.
But the series does this because of the points it is trying to make. The reason Kirito and Asuna are so developed compared to other characters not because the other anime characters are never going to be developed at all now or in a future season, but rather because developing these two characters sets forth the points the series wants to make.
So why waste time developing other characters except for the fact that it's just convention? In my opinion, there is no reason to do this at all.
That's the first thing.
Point #2:
This series has a lot of very sophisticated beautiful music soundtracks that range from being very sad to being very epic. These all match what the characters are feeling and are beautifully executed. In a way, SAO was created for a reason and the reason it was actually created is left up to the viewer to decide. But it actually becomes somewhat obvious if you think about the point for a long enough time. SAO is attempting to be a game-changing thought provoking series that has a lot of amazing features in addition to good-looking characters, and romantic exchanges between characters. Every second in SAO, the players are worried for their individual and collective survival and which one matters more at any given point in time is very thought-provoking and interesting to watch.
SAO is a very dynamic series that covers a lot of cool topics and for the reasons I said above + other compelling reasons for why a series that has slow paced + fast paced episodes could be so good.
The animation, sound, art, and story are all amazingly done even if the story has time-skips and the characters aren't fully developed on-screen... 
Story:
The story skips around sometimes, but it makes the points the series is trying to make very well and it is extremely emotional at times while very heartwarming at others. All in all it is extremely well done. 10/10.
Art:
The Art is absolutely fantastic. Except for perhaps Attack On Titan (at some points) it is the best art I have ever seen in any series that I have watched. This is partly because the art is integrated with what thematic concepts are trying to be conveyed at each point in time and the art not only looks amazing, but says a lot about undercurrents of what is happening in the anime. 10/10.
Sound:
This anime has almost all of my favorite anime soundtracks of all time. End of story. 10/10. I would rate it higher if I could.
This review has no spoilers:
Character:
Some characters are under-developed (in the anime) but they are all interesting in their own way.
Kirito, Asuna, Suguha are more developed than a majority of the other characters in the series. But the character development and actions of Kirito, Asuna, and Suguha just breath-take the audience while they watch the series.
Also, one of the large themes in the series is about how in a virtual world you can choose who you want to be and actively pursue it, always improving while heading towards this goal of (impossible) perfection. Kirito is the embodiment of a character who wants to do better, achieve more, and surpass what he was before. He always wants to improve himself because of how responsible he feels for saving the other people in the game. One of the largest points of this series is that the rules of a virtual world are fixed and in the end, caring enough about what you want to achieve and working as hard as you can to figure out the rules of the game, you can even understand more about the game than the person who created the game himself and you might be able to beat him... This plot-point isn't hard to imagine at all. Given that when you are playing a game in a virtual reality world, your brain is controlling all of the actions you make in that world, how amazing you can become at understanding everything in that virtual world just has to do with how well you understand how the game works. The creator of the game made all of the rules in the game, but the creator doesn't know how all of the rules interact with each other and how to manipulate them in every possible way.
Achieving your limits in other words is a huge theme of this series and Kirito does it in a really bad-ass way.
Other characters have really emotional plot points and they all serve to show how Kirito (who is the model individual who this story is focusing on in this world that has a lot of other characters who haven't been shown on-screen) and Asuna develop. This doesn't mean the other characters aren't important.  It just means there wasn't room in the anime to include them because a point was trying to be made.
However, because this series had to adopt a novel series this is partly why people expect this anime series to develop every character perfectly and come back to them all of the time. Just to satisfy people who think those aspects of a series should matter a little, I'll give character 8/10.
Enjoyment:
9/10. The only reason it isn't 10/10 is because I originally didn't realize SAO was a light novel series and I originally didn't realize what SAO was trying to convey until about episode 8. The coolness of all  of the earlier parts of the anime and the amazing music made me want to watch more, but I didn't get what the anime was trying to show. So the first time  I watched it I kind of wanted to skip through some of the slower-paced scenes.
After I watched it though completely and realized exactly what the series was about, when I rewatched it already knowing this it was absolutely amazing and became my second favorite series I have ever seen. This is why I want to point out right now that despite all of the hate SAO gets: 1. It isn't a normal anime so it should be thought about differently when being watched. 2. It has breathtaking visuals, incredible music, and wonder voice-acting. These things make SAO a great series. These are the things which made me love it. These are the things I liked about it.
Overall:
Sure SAO had a lot of problems if you treat it like a normal anime, but if you actually are rating the show based on what it wanted to convey, it did it amazingly and it was really well done. Different anime exist for different reasons. SAO exists because of how beautiful it looks, how nice it sounds, and its deep plot content. If you are just looking for an anime that connects all of the dots for you in order to have a regular rom-com in a regular Japanese city, in a regular world, without any strange scenario, then don't watch this, watch a normal series. This series is good because it is different. It is a light novel series -&gt; anime. And should be thought of working like that when being rated.
This is why I really loved the series, thought the characters were really cool, and loved the virtual world outlined in the show, and all of its societal consequences that arose because of the progression of the online death game.
10/10!!!",10

                Okay, this anime was fine, like my score. I'm not going to bash it, but I'll say what I liked and didn't like.
Likes: The only thing I swear I really liked was episode 14 and the opening Crossing Field by LiSA. The anime is starts off good, but then when it gets to like episode 10 where the main male and female protagonist get together, I got bored, but then when episode 13 hit it got better. The first half of the season was episode 1-14. 
Dislike: My opinion is that you do NOT watch the second half of the season, which is episodes 15-25.
                  The main female protagonist was likeable at first, but then she got all whiny and damsel in distress on us, so it was like the male protagonist had to always come save her, which he did. Another thing I disliked was the fact that all the female characters had a crush on him. That's what I disliked about a lot of animes. A guy isn't that great that you have all the girls fall in love with him. And even when the male protagonist already had a girlfriend, he sometimes looked like he flirted with the other girls sometimes. Even his younger sister (technically cousin).
Art: Decent, but I've seen prettier and better art.
All in all, I give Sword Art Online a 6. It was decent, but it could have done better. It's not the best anime I've seen.",6
"
                To  start this anime is so good i love the story the charters the openings everything about it. Theres action, romance, adventure, fantasy.
STORY: Its in the future were people play in a virtual RPG game but the thing is they cant logout until someone beats the game. The worst part is if they die in the game they all so die in real life
Art: the animation is great the back grounds and the settings are great
Sounds: the openings and ending songs are nice. the sounds effects are detailed an nice too
Characters: not gonna mention them one by one because then that will spoil things
                  but there's a lot of characters here that are introduced that have there own qualities 
this is a high recommended anime for those who haven't seen it yet and should check it out.",10
"
                Everyone who watches anime knows about Sword Art Online. It’s one of the most popular anime around currently and has been since its release. There are some people that hold it up as the holy grail of anime and others that wouldn’t piss on it to put it out if it was on fire. However, taking such extreme sides on this anime is not worth it. SAO is a good/decent anime; SAO is not perfect. SAO does a lot of things wrong, horribly wrong in some cases, but it does have redeeming qualities. So don’t judge it based on an extremist point of view. 
The
                  most important part of any anime is the story. If the story is garbage no one will want to watch the anime. In the case of SAO, it has so much potential it could demolish a mountain with how much potential it has. However, some of the story keeps it from actually reaching that great potential. The VRMMO worlds in SAO have literally limitless potential because they take place in a video game. Anything can happen because of programming, but the writers haven’t done a great job at utilizing that. The story starts off so great: thousands of players are trapped in a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) ((it’s a mouthful to say)) and if they die in the game world, they die in real life. Everyone’s life is on the line, people fight to survive the dungeons, reach higher levels, get more money, better loot, and find a way to get out of the game (they can’t turn off their VR headsets and log out of the game). 
So the story follows Kirito, I think his name is Kazuto Kirigaya but I never really cared, and the friends/allies he makes along the way. He’s a good guy, I’ll give him that, BUT IF THERE IS TROUBLE, NEVER FEAR BECAUSE KIRITO-EX-MACHINA (Kirito the god of time and space) IS ALWAYS THERE TO RESCUE/SAVE THE DAY WITH HIS PLOT ARMOR POWERS. As much as I hate that aspect of the story... no it’s just bad/lazy writing. I called bullshit on every single time Kirito did his plot armor bullshit, except for one time because I have a love for Asuna and that’s all you’re getting on that spoiler. 
It continues until they find the way out, duh that’s going to happen. BUT IT HAPPENS SO SOON THAT IT PISSES ME OFF. THERE IS SO MUCH TENSION IN EVERY EPISODE WHEN THE CONSTANT DANGER OF ACTUALLY DYING IS ALWAYS PRESENT. Anyway a way out is found then they dive into a new VRMMORPG for the next arc… WHICH I REFUSE TO WATCH BECAUSE IT DOES THE WORST THING ANY STORY CAN DO. It makes its best character, Asuna, into a damsel in distress. I don’t want to see the strongest character be turned into a damsel in distress, and I know you don’t want to see that either. So not much else to say for this arc except it sucks and you should skip it. 
Now to talk about the second most redeeming aspect of the anime: its characters. Kirito, the “protagonist” (Kirito-ex-machina), is a developed character. He has strong moral standing and fierce determination. He feels genuine love, compassion, sympathy, and empathy for the people trapped in the VR. That makes him a good guy who I actually want to succeed. What is wrong with his character comes from the writing: KIRITO-EX-MACHINA. He overcomes everything in a way that just pisses off anyone who’s ever played a video game. It’s cheating. It’s like running around in Dark Souls with full Havel Armor, fast roll, Ninja Flip Ring, Max agility, RTSR (Red Tear Stone Ring) and BTSR (Blue TSR) bonuses, and the Black Knight Sword, then being able to do combos while dual wielding the BKS on New Game (That is literally as OP you can get, unless you use the Demon Great Hammer because it has the highest damage). It’s ridiculous how much he can do. That’s what I hate, it takes away from the story so much. I want to see a raid party actually coordinate and use awesome tactics to take down these tough raid bosses. BUT NO, KIRITO CAN LITERALLY DO IT ON HIS OWN. It’s bullshit. 
Next up we have the precious baby Asuna whom I love with the intensity of a dying sun. She’s pretty developed, I don’t really remember the specifics because it wasn’t as much as Kirito. She is morally sound, she shares most of the same characteristics as Kirito, but she does have a little different dynamic when she becomes a mother to a cuter more awesome version of Navi. She acts like I would expect a mature, teenager mom to. She genuinely loves Kirito and the little pixie anime girl Navi whose name I don’t remember (she is hella cute lemme tell ya).  She is a very strong female character, both physically and mentally: she’s one of the toughest players in SAO and is a great leader. She’s high ranking member of the top guild in SAO, and you don’t get that prestige from being a stupid noob. Yeah the damsel in distress arc is a blight on her character development and then you don’t see much of her during SAO II because Sinon becomes the main female character. (Sinon is a precious bby too and way more dynamic) But other than that, Asuna is a gorgeous girl. I’d give her a 9/10 as waifu material. 
As far as the minor characters go, I don’t really remember any of the names nor do I really care too much. The minor characters aren’t terrible, but they’re not great either. They do their job, some of them are really great, though I don’t remember the names, but they show up early in the first season. As far as the main party goes, I like it, Kirito, Asuna, Kline I think? Silica, Lisbeth?, an Elf Girl and then Kirito and Asuna’s pseudo-love-child-anime-girl-Navi function well together and I enjoy seeing them. That’s about it for characters. They are better than a lot of other ones in worse anime and help add to the awesomeness of the world. 
AND NOW FOR THE BEST PART OF THE ANIME: *DRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMM RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL* THE VRMMORPG WORLD ITSELF!!!! Yes, the world that SAO takes place in is by far the most amazing thing in anime. It’s a gamer’s wet dream, it’s enough to make a hardcore player orgasm from the intricacies, scale, and just fucking perfectness of everything. Yes there is a lot of bias here because I’ve been a gamer since before I could consciously form memories, but this is my review so deal with it. I want to see the VR world of SAO be something IRL. It’s so huge, it’s literally a full blown community where you can be anything you want: blacksmith, merchant, shop owner, ect. You can buy houses, hang out at places (not really explored in the anime), go through massive dungeons, I think design houses, but I’m not sure, go anywhere that you have unlocked by progressing through the levels. It’s so amazing, and it is what makes the score for this anime so much higher than it would be. 
The art style and animation of SAO are pretty decent. I don’t hate it, but it’s nothing like the Monogatari series. It’s good enough to attract more serious anime viewers, but simple enough to attract more casual watchers. Nothing fancy, nothing extreme, nothing too much. It’s the right fit. You won’t be wowed by the art and animation is what I’m saying. 
As far as the soundtrack goes, it didn’t stand out to me at all. I think that it was appropriate for each situation and helped improve the scenes. Although I have a love for the OP of the first season because it’s by LiSA. It also does its job. 
You don’t watch this anime for its themes. None of them stood out and were so generic that they’re not worth mentioning. 
In conclusion, SAO is a decent anime. There are few big flaws, more minor flaws, but also a lot of really strong points. Kirito-ex-machina is still bullshit, the damsel in distress arc is awful, and de-evolution of the story takes a big hit on the anime. On the other side, the beginning of the story is extremely strong and tense, the characters are lovable and sympathetic, and THAT VRMMORPG WORLD (get me a glass of water because it is getting hot in here) is going to be a gamer’s wet dream until we get it IRL. 
I give it a solid 6.5/10
It’s not as bad as some say, but it’s still not the holy grail of anime. It could have a higher score if the writers actually used the potential the VRMMORPG world gives them, and stop being so damn lazy. It gets 3.5 points for the world it takes place in by itself, 2 points for the beginning story, and 1 point for the characters. I look to see how many points out of ten an anime earns, not to take points away from it. It is judged for what it is, not what it is compared to other anime. Thank you for reading this! I hope you have a great day! ♥",7

                SAO blew my expectations away.
I hate lengthy reviews, so here is one simple paragraph. 
At first I thought I was going to be watching a story unfold one level at a time as they conquer new bosses every episode in a struggle to win their survival. That alone is a decent story but it could get old, right? Apparently, they knew that. So, the series was nothing like that. Instead, you found yourself exploring the day to day life of living in a virtual world while going on compelling quests and establishing amazing moments and relationships. The feels are SO strong in this anime. I
                  was brought to tears and inspired every few episodes. They really did such an amazing job. There is nothing bad about SAO. Something about the way they set up for these amazing moments is just commendable. Music is great. Art is great. Characters are insanely amazing! The story is so much bigger than it first appears and they waste no time showing you that by example in the first few episodes. All in all, SAO is one of the most beautiful stories you will ever experience.",9
"
                Story- Trapped in a world where death in a video game is real. MC is op and doesn't show his true powers and meets  Asuna (Marry Sue) that is also op. They come to like each other throughout the series. Btw MC is op.
Art-Nice colors and good amount of frames to compliment.
Sound- Nice music to compliment the important scenes like when they're fighting
Character- MC is op. He is op for no reason. He way to powerful when you compare that hes only a kid and yet people who are older than him are far weaker and scrawny. Asuna is a marry sue. Every action
                  she takes is unquestion and she is almost perfect in every way. There is no ""character progression"" because there is none to progress since they're like max level already >_>. Every other character is non existence because no one cares about that.",8
"
                This review contains spoilers and i recommend watching the series then coming to read this review, or if you've already watched the series to it's latest then go ahead.
Have you watched Ep 24 of SAO??? If you have then i can now explain why i hate and love the series sooooo much at the same time. 
First of all, it's an okay anime for an LN adaptation and the only reason i have continued to torture myself and watch this far into the series is because of my loyalty to the LN. It's animation and art-style aren't too amazing, making a really... mediocre anime to
                  someone outside of the LN fan base. The only thing it had going was the whole fantasy virtual world concept and occasional fight scenes that somehow made it easier to watch. 
I don't know, but maybe before the first season came out, it was the most anticipated anime of that season thus, so many others were sucked into the series. However as the series went along, the fight scenes got shorter and it progressively left less and less of an emotional impact on me. (The Sachi arc made me tear up but the Scilica arc was ehhhh~ and the Liz arc was meh)
Though the ending of the first season somewhat saved the series i really dreaded the coming of the second season.
Along then came the F**KING SECOND SEASON. 
Though many of you are unaware (i am unsure how many of you read the light novels) the second season was full of useless fillers instead of progressing along the story line as well as they did in the first. Even if they did stop to emphasize the relationship between a few character (namely SUGUHA's love for her  ONIIIII-chan) it did nothing to justify the series and made the show from a harem show to an incest show. (I mean even OreImo was less incest than this bullshit, at least in OreImo they didn't make it clear that one of the siblings wanted to f**k the other) So... after 24 filler filled episodes of incest and badly done fight scenes what do they do? 
THEY STRIP THE DIGNITY (and clothes) OFF THE MAIN FEMALE PROTAGONIST OF SEASON 1 AND AS IF ONE LOLI WAS'T ENOUGH THEY TURN YUI INTO OTAKU BAIT AND HAVE HER IN REALLY AWKWARD POSES WITH KIRITO and... and....
......
Seriously.... thank god there is only one episode left... my head hurts.... anyways guys, i seriously don't know how you people felt about this show but seriously... ****
Anyways this is MY OPINION on the series and if you felt any differently there is no need to start a fight, just send me a message and i'll reply.",5

I realize that these scores may bemuse the majority of those who decide to view this review, however, I have solid basis for such conflicting ratings in particular areas.
For many people, the thought of venturing into the realm of mysticism, and virtual reality which is a video game, grants a long-awaited fantasy for many gamers, which I can personally relate to. Adding a tinge of fatality into the mixture made the plot all the more teasingly attractive– Unfortunately, some major issues with character development, and rising action posed a significant toll on a what would've been, magnificent production.
                  
Kirito is most definitely a good protagonist, a little too good, which stunted my initial issues with him. Sword art online, with the solid and exciting plot, would lead one to believe that some sort of team collaboration should be incorporated to escape their untimely demise. Quite the opposite happened, actually. It became a sort of one-man show, as every character merely possessed a glimmer of the lime light in the few minutes after the opening theme, before Kirito, sopped up the the remaining episode. Each difficulty the characters faced, left them helplessly relying on their knight in shining armor to save them, or perish in an attempt to make tragedy a highlight. This only made the side characters seem dull, or better yet, unnecessary, which also drew away from Kirito's character, since the viewer could probably guess who would come out victorious. 
Leading me to comment on the laughably bad villains. It speaks for itself. 
The most enjoyable, part of the series was the romance. Which ironically was foiled by the shoddy harem created from every girl met on these adventures, falling into a hopelessly unrequited love with our dear protagonist. Asuna was a very good character, I just wish she had more screen time. 
I'll end this on a high note. The art and music were undeniably outstanding. It would've been nice to showcase more character animation, besides Kirito's. 
Not a bad anime, the structure and details were there. Overly simplistic in character development, and relationships.",6
"
                For myself, I see this anime as being broken up into two diverse series. The first series (first half of the anime), I found it to be incredibly disappointing. I had high expectations for it with the seemingly high emphasis on scenery and the inclusion of Yuki Kajiura whom I had hoped would make an amazing track for the series. Unfortunately, the music was few and lacking throughout the series. I cannot remember a single track from the entire anime (which is quite sad). What baffled me most is the lack of fight scenes with quality in the anime (first part of anime). The anime
                  seemingly had a relatively good budget and yet the music was not in rhythm of the fights or the fights themselves were just bland. Prior to watching the second half of the anime, I was scoring the anime just 3 since it was such a letdown.
After finally I convinced myself to watch the rest and surprisingly it was an improvement. The music was still lacking but the fight scenes improved quite a bit. The characters were less annoying and I felt interested in finishing it. Which is why I was able to raise my score after finishing the anime. With that said, the anime still has a number of problems.
The characters had zero depth to them. It was as if the series was designed for those with ADD because after being introduced to a character, we would see them again at most, one more time. I had forgotten most of the characters by the end of the anime, no substance to them at all.
The whole ""game"" aspect of the anime felt forced and unnecessary. The whole point of items being somewhat important were thrown out the window. Throughout the series, it felt like there was a quota for mmorpg references and they had to reach it during each episode. Oh, let us mention something about the flying timer and make it seem important... it ends up being pretty much completely ignored afterwards and to some degree, seems like the idea was actually removed.
In the second part of the anime, it turned quite dark. Now, I am all for dark and troubling moments. But there were moments that were pretty much ""rape rape rape"" which detracted from any enjoyment that I was originally having. There was no rhyme or reason for it, just felt forced (like the game genre). 
All-in-all, the anime felt rushed. Be it the fault of the developers or the manga, I do not know. Whomever is to blame really dropped the ball. At no point did I feel invested in any of the characters beyond that of the main ones. The anime's story for the most part felt like it was moving along slowly but everything as a whole felt rushed. And in the end, the whole point of it being in in a game just pointless.",5

                Review on 23rd December, 2015
""What’s the difference between the real world and the virtual one?""-Asuna
Actually, there's a couple, but that is not what this review is about. Sword Art Online (SAO for shorts), is an anime by A-1 Pictures, that is quite similar to another anime, Log Horizon. Is OAS a good anime of not? Let's find out...no wait...it's SAO...
NOTE: (Ditto from all the other reviews) and another thing. I will do this review a little different. The plot, opening/ending and characters session will be split into two, so that I can separately talk about each arc's characters and plot.
Plot- Arc 1: 4/5
People argue for,
                  day to day which arc was the best...no wait, everyone agrees it is the first arc, and I would had too. This was SAO's strongest plot, as we don't see so much romance until late episode 11. The plot is quite good actually, I liked the concept of once you die, you die. This was the only arc to feature that concept, and it was a good one. Shame that A-1 pictures removed it after Arc 1. The KiritoXAsuna Arc was quite cute, but it went wwaaayyyyy over the top in Arc 2, and I will get to that once we talk about Arc 2. The ending of the first arc was sweet. A minor flaw I had with this arc, is how they didn't show the fight with the Laughing Coffin. It would had been an interesting and intense fight...oh well. But overall, it's obvious why this is the best arc of all of the arcs. Good concept, KiritoXAsuna when it didn't go over the top, and the really sweet ending. However could had been improved if the Laughing Coffin fight was included.
        Arc 2: 2/5
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Because the first arc was so good I was so hyped for the second arc. But all that hype was for a rushed plot...a very rushed plot. I simply hated the whole, ""Asuna is useless as hell so Kirito come get her."" This was definitely out of character and affected the plot really harshly. I also hated the antagonist's goal in the second arc. It was honestly really stupid and illogical. I have so many things that makes this plot bad, but I don't want to make this too long. So I will just end it here.  
Characters- Arc 1: 3/5
The characters are...alright to say the least. I sorta liked Sachi's character...idk what it is, but I just like it. Like I mentioned, Asuna in this arc was as badass as Batman doing a fancy move, and that should be Asuna's character throughout the season. Still shame that they change it. HOWEVER! The thing that really put characters down is...Kyubey drumroll plz........Kirito. Man, I want to talk about how bad is Kirito for a long time. First of all, his voice is annoying in dub...Second of all, every girl for some reason falls for him. Jesus, what are you? A chick magnet? Want me to find a bunch of chicks and you use a magnet to attract them all? (joke intended). And third of all, his character is pretty damn bad. But I give him credit, his quotes aren't actually that bad. Additionally, he gets even worse as the eps go on, and I will talk about that in Arc 2. Overall, characters had been ruined completely by Kirito, the main character of this whole season.
                  Arc 2: 1/5
Man, the second arc was even more disappointing in the characters then when they ran out of ice cream in the cafe! Asuna was out of character! Recon and Suguha was irrelevant! Lisbeth, Klein and Silica had almost no role in this arc what so ever, and the worst thing of them all, KIRITO WENT EVEN WORSE! Man, his obsession with Asuna went really bad this arc, even going to the point of mental! The villain is just outright bad! Yui...was actually ok, but that doesn't help how crap everything about the characters is in arc 2. It's so bad...that I have to give out my very first 1...my very first 1...That deserves a trophy. Sword Arts online, you earned the trophy of the dripping ice cream of disappointment! Congrats! (Clap clap clap clap)
Animation/sound: 9/10
Stunning. Just, stunning. The animation was really good. Nothing bad to say about it. And the sound was good, but could be improved. Nothing else to say really, besides that this was one of Sword Arts's strongest point.
Opening/ending- Arc 1: 4/5
The White koala returns! Opening and ending was pretty damn good. It fits pretty well with the theme of the anime. Also pretty catchy, both opening and ending. Nothing else to say about the opening and ending.
                         Arc 2: 4/5
Same as arc 1, except not as catchy.
Enjoyment: 8/10
Kirito really hurt this section. His determination to save Asuna, even going up to the point of rage really killed the ending. Arc 2 was also responsible for this, but because of the hype I felt after Arc 1, I gave it an 8
Overall: 35/50
This is generally a good anime to watch if you are starting to watch anime, but definitely not recommended if you watched anime for a while.
After this review:
Phew, that was long...I need a break. 
I will stop reviewing tomorrow, and will be back for a Christmas special on Friday, where I will review 2 random animes and an anime with a Christmas special. (Spoiler, it's K-on!)",7
"
                Sword Art Online (SAO) is a unique anime, at least for me. As a gamer, I was intrigued by the possibility of vmmorpgs, and how the author made this ""game"" into a new reality. I read the novel, probably since February, and enjoyed it so I couldn't wait for the anime to come out. Well, heres my 2 cents on SAO.
(Spoiler Alert?)
Story: 6/10
As I stated earlier, the storyline, I thought, was unique and interesting. However, the biggest problem with the storyline is probably to what extent the anime explained certain things. A majority of the first few episodes were either side stories or just references
                  during the main storyline (which is why it was so inconsistent). Obviously, this made it difficult for the animators to create the story left out by Kawahara (but they did a decent job). Therefore, a majority of the stories felt irrelevant to the actual storyline, and this definitely made the anime feel like it was full of fillers. The fact that it kept jumping around made it seem disoriented, confusing, disorganized, and badly planned. It barely explained certain things, while it spent way too much time on other events. Still, when it finally went into the real storyline, the side stories started to connect (some of them) and the story became even more addicting.
With romance as a great influence, Kirito and Asuna overcome impossible odds in the death game, freeing most of the imprisoned players. Then, after they conquered Aincrad, Kirito is forced to overcome the trauma of the nervegear and conquer a new game, ALO, to find and free his true love. Overcoming not only obstacles in games but also in real life for the sake of love, Kirito manages to save the most important person in his life... Such a beautiful bow-tie ending.
Unfortunately, there are many holes that aren't filled at the end of the first season, ruining some of my expectations.
Art: 7/10
The graphics and animations were pretty good. However, my biggest complaint would be that nearly none of the fights are animated. They have some animations, but either develop too quickly (making the fight seemingly effortless) or filled with pictures not animations (weakening the hold on the audience). These mistakes weakens the effect animes are supposed to have, hurting the overall score of the anime.
Music: 8/10
Good music. Not much to say.
Characters: 7/10
Because a majority of the anime was from side stories or just references to the ""past"", a majority of the characters were not very well developed. Honestly, there are too many heroines (creating a harem?) that, within the short time given to the anime, the characters feel so flat. Also, the character ""Kirito"" is a little cliche, but it seems to be the best way to compliment the storyline, so not many complaints there.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Since I did read the novel, I understood every part of the anime and it was really enjoyable. I was impressed by how well some scenes were done, while irritated at how they skipped/ignored some other important information. Still, my friends and I eagerly awaited every saturday to watch the new episode, so my enjoyment was ""Great"".
Overall: 8/10
I believe that SAO is a great anime. It had much more potential than it lived up to, but it's still very good. I honestly recommend reading the novel for clarifications and more explanations. Then you can preview the next season(s), Phantom Bullet, Mother's Rosario, and Alicization. Reading the novel helped me enjoy SAO so much more, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as i did.",8

                As you all know, Sword Art Online is an extremely popular anime. Half of the anime fandom loves it, half of it absolutely hates it. I personally have friends who thought this series was a masterpiece, and I also have friends who think this series was crap.
I enjoyed this series, but once I actually took the time to grade this work, I found that this series is definately NOT as good as everyone says. 
The good parts: The sound is amazing. The soundtrack was really good. The openings and OSTs are so good, I listen to it while I do my homework. Also, the voice
                  actors did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life, and they fit each of the character's personality perfectly. The art was very good. Nothing was too overdone and the character designs were cute. To prove this, I even have a poster in my room, even though I thought this series wasn't that good overall. 
The bad parts: The story. Oh no. While I liked the general idea of VRMMORPGs, the way the characters were used was bad. First of all, they didn't even state why they're stuck in the game in the first place. There are way too many plot wholes like this, I won't even bother listing them. ALso, the characters. Kirito is way too overpowered. He not only is basically the best player in the game, for some strange reason, he even gets all the girls. I mean, come on. I appreciated the action in this story, but it was generally boring because everything was predictable and way too dramatic. 
Overall, this series wasn't that good. Watch the abridged version guys.",6
"
                First of all I wanted to say that this anime is one of the best anime I have seen,
I would give it 12/10 at least if i could.
The story of the anime is realy realy good, its developing not too fast and also not too slow. 
Although I realy liked the story line I  some pepole may not like it that much.
The art in my opinion is realy good, Although there are some animes that their art is a bit better, but I realy like how the animations were shown in the anime.
The characters.... I cant realy describe how much I liked them, While
                  I was seeing the anime I realy felt connected to the characters, I realy like them, although the main evil character is a bit too mysterious and unclear in my opinion thats why it got 9 and not 10.
The anime is realy fascinating, while i was watching the anime (while it was still airing) I found myself in constant thinking about what will happen next and just waiting to watch the next episode.
I realy recommend watching this anime, I realy enjoyed it about you will too.",10
"
                Ok, I know reviews on SOA are abundant so I'll keep this one short. 
The concept is very cool, and something that gets you hooked right off the bat, but I really liked it for two reasons. 
1. The relationship between Kirito and Asuna is beautiful, and as they fall in love with each other, I began to fall in love with them as a couple. When a writer successfully pulls this off, he just hit the _literary lottery_  (try saying those two words over and over again). I was just as happy watching them just binge together as I was watching the main
                  plot. Happier even!   
2. Because of this beautiful inner love story, the plot itself gained an added layer of depth. Suddenly I began to truly care about Kirito's journey, because I longingly wanted to see Kirito and Asuna be together again. And that makes for an great story.",9
"
                To review an popular anime, you must expected to be banned with many lovers and haters. Sword Art Online is an anime related on Viedo Game, it is dark, it has jokes , and it has somethings that really catch your eyes. However, the story can't go with a good way, it lets to the anime become a bit bullshit and not much things can stand out.
First of all, the story is about a guy named kirito and joined in a VRMMO called Sword Art Online, everyone was joyful and hoping to have an wonderful experience in this game. However, the creator of the game,
                  Akihiko Kayaba cut down all method to get out the game unless you can defeated all 100 boss, another problem is if you are died in the game, you cannot reborn and you will also dead in the reality world.
The setting of the story is really well written, but the anime don't have further explain and introduce more features in SAO, that let the story become imcompleted, too much branches in SAO, and not enough focus point in the story either, kirito is too edge and can do anything he likes include catching females to become his pet, undefeated sword and unlimited speed, this kind of things has totally destroyed the story. 
After the story in SAO, the story continued in ALO, which means the more poor storyline , more op kirito, more fucking rubbish female fell in love with kirito has came. The only things I want to enjoy has also gone, the quality of battling has decrease slightly, the final boss battle is totally rubbish, kirito isn't strong enough to fight Nobuyuki Sugou back and at the same time asuna is raping by him. When all of us is really looking forward how kirito fixed the problen. The anime told us Akihiko Kayaba borrow the limits of authority of system in ALO and SAO to kirito. Fuck, then why I need to watch the last 10 ep, it just a piece of shit.
The art and sound did well in the series, however, there are not enough scenes to let both of the art and sound become epic. The battling scene isn't enough, the art need to use in something not related to VRMMO, what a pity.
The characters development is the worst things in the series, no anyone can standing out. Kiritois a hero but after about 10 eps, he totally forgot about Sachi and Black Cats of the Full Moon, and the most shitting things is he still don't konw about the felling of his female (friends?, actually his characters isn't very uniqe and nothing rally standing out. Asuna is the main female characters in this series but I don't think she is anything special, how she fell in love with kirito and wht does she experiece is something that the anime haven't been written.Another characters like Yui, Silica, Lisbeth eg are more poor , nothing uniqe and I cannot tell difference without the voice in the outfit.Leafa is the main female characters in ALO, although I can her differnce with Asuna and other characters, I don't actuaaly figured out the love on his onii chan kirito, no explaination and tell us she loves him, that's rediculous.
Actually the story has alos many things that are well, wonderful battling scene and the first three ep is epic. However the story hasn't developed in a proper way. The setting of SAO is well written and the voice characters of Japan is good. The seris definately not a masterpiece but it is not a garbage. It is still remain average and derserved popular.",6
"
                Story: 
The premise is really interesting, and the first two episodes are pretty good. They show the setting and the lone-wolf kind of guy that Kirito is. Also, as the second episode happens two months after the first episode, it shows a little bit of how has life changed for those who are trapped in the game. Because of that, this two episodes are really interesting and it makes you wonder what's gonna happen next. Sadly, the anime goes downhill from here and the next episodes show you that it doesn't know how to take advantage of the premise they have built upon.
The anime makes
                  a sudden and extremely early turn of focusing on episodic content rather than advancing the story. Episodic shows can be really enjoyable, but here it just doesn't work with the premise the anime has. Why would I want to watch Kirito do the equivalent of a videogame side quests instead of actually struggling and fighting for his freedom when this is the point they've been trying to sell us in the first two episodes? It's like if in Attack on Titan instead of showing us how our heroes fight against the titans we get to see Eren doing some random errands while all of the action and drama of dealing with the titans happens offscreen. I would forgive this more if the episodes were interesting enough to make you forget that the story isn't progressing at all, but to me it was all pretty mediocre and predictable
Then we get a few episodes that actually focus on trying to beat the game, more Kirito doing random shenanigans, and finally, we get to advancing the story again.
And while you might think things will take longer, the final boss appears early and kinda out of nowhere. There's no anticipation, no witty dialogue from either the hero or the villain before the fight, not even an emotional moment to remember what the stakes are. It just happens.
Let me make a parenthesis here to tell you that, by this point, battles are pretty predictable. Kirito overpowers his enemies from the start because of some skill he has or just because he is that great. And even if he himself gets overpowered, he suddenly gets a way to overpower his enemy back or someone else saves him. There's not a single time when you can see a close battle in which anything could happen. The one time Kirito actually lost, in the end of that same episode it was proven that his defeat didn't really make a difference on anything other than being a mere inconvenience.
I bother on writting that because not only does it show that fights are boring and uninteresting, but that by the point of him having to face the final boss there's really no expectations for this battle, and you would be right on assuming that.
The final battle ends with a good old deus ex machina. If you don't know what that is, it basically means that things happen with no believable explanation. In fact, there's no trying to explain how did Kirito win at all. He completely broke programmed in-game and real life rules just cause.
The big bad is finally defeated, so we only need an epilogue of some sort, right? Well, the thing here is... we're only in episode 14 and there's a total of 25 episodes.  What, you may ask, can come next? I'll try to keep it as short as possible.
Everyone wakes up except for Kirito's love interest, Asuna, who's still trapped in another game because some guy wants to marry her and for some reason (money) her parents are ok with it and will give let the marriage happen without letting Asuna have any choice. Kirito, obviously decides to rescue her in a game very similar to SAO, but this time if you die ingame you don't die in real life. And there I thought I couldn't be any less worried for them.
I could talk more about it, but I don't think it's worth the time I'll take writing it and the time you'll take reading it. I think you already have a pretty good idea as to why this part of the anime is worse than the previous 14 episodes and I personally couldn't have waited more for it to be over.
Characters:
The story is bad, but the real problem here are the characters. I strongly believe that if you don't care about the characters you can't really care about the story, and they are as bland as they get.
First we got Kirito, our main man. At first it looks like he could be a little interesting. Remember how I said the anime showed us a bit of Kirito's personality in the first episodes? Well, forget about all that because Kirito throws the little lone-wolf and rebellious archetype he had going on and throws it through the window and becomes another boring power fantasy protagonist by not showing any of his personality traits. His only characteristics are being better than everyone else, except for that one time in which he lost, and being irresistible to every girl he meets, including his own sister.
To be fair, though, there's one moment that seems to change Kirito by reinforcing his solitary attitude he has... but it only really shows when he explicitly mentions it and never again.
Then we got Asuna which is the really, really obvious love interest right from the beggining. She's a little misterious at first but that ends the same episode she gets introduced. The only thing I can say about her is that she likes cooking enough so that she decides to level that skill up to the maximum instead of expending those experience points in something far more useful, which, even though a lot may think it's really dumb, I think it actually gives her a little bit of personality, but that's really it.
Finally, we got my ""favorite"" character of the show. Kirito's sister, Suguha. Even though her whole character is based around her forbidden love, she's the only character that we actually see struggling with something and having some sort of development. I actually felt a little sad for her, which is something no other character made me feel. Actually, no one other than her made me feel anything at all.
""Where's all the other characters?"" You might ask, and the thing is... they don't exist. I mean, they do, but if the main cast is replaceable, I really don't know how much lower can I put the rest of the characters. They're just plot tools, and that's if they're lucky. Most of them aren't even that.
But not everything is bad...
Art & Sound:
This is the part that I actually liked. From the first episodes I was pleasantly surprised at all the backgrounds which really stand out. They're really beautiful and I even paused some episodes just so I could contemplate them some more. The animations are generally good and fluid. I didn't caught any ""derp faces"" or things like that.
The music is really amazing and it does a good job of setting the mood. Too bad the general characters and story ruin that mood, but if it was in a better show, it would just add to the experience. The first opening is sometimes stuck in my head, too.
Final thoughts:
I think I already expressed how bad this anime was for me. There's a lot more things I could have gotten into, but I don't want to give any important spoilers because, unlike a lot of people, rather than an angry rant, I mostly want to give people something that can help them decide if they want to watch it or not. Even though this was mostly a negative review, I want to strongly encourage you to read more reviews, specially positive ones, so that you can have a different point of view other than mine. Who knows, maybe you'll actually find out you really enjoy this anime, and I wouldn't want to stop you from having a nice time.
Final Score: 3/10",3
"
                Sword Art Online – the most divisive anime that premiered back in 2012. It’s one of those shows that people love or love to hate. Is the show good? Kind of… Is the show bad? Maybe…
What went wrong?
A problem with SAO is its pacing. After the first three episodes that are more or less within the same time frame, the show leaps several months between episodes that span two years. This is to skip any leveling up and grinding that the characters need to do to survive in the virtual world, understandably. However, because of the several time skips, viewers can become lost or confused
                  on how characters went from point A to point B all the way to point Z. How characters end up in the situation that they are in is told in dialogue, but can be easily missed.  
The time skips is related to another problem with the show, character development – particularly the relationship with Kirito and Asuna. Credit where credit is due, SAO deserves props for having characters in a relationship, which is a rarity in Anime. The problem? The relationship is forced.  Imagine you’re a person with relative good looks, and you ask a really attractive guy/girl out on a date. And then you get to 3rd base on the first date. That’s pretty much Kirito and Asuna’s relationship in a nutshell. It’s easy to understand why Kirito is attracted to Asuna. He’s a teenager with hormones who is close to the attractive, ideal woman Asuna. However, the story doesn’t, at least in my eyes, show how Asuna fall for Kirito. (I didn’t get it. Maybe someone can explain to me). Because of the time skips, it is difficult to become invested with any of the characters. It’s even harder to be invested in a relationship with characters that there is little to no investment devoted to, which leads to the biggest problem of SAO: the entire Fairy Dance Arc.
Talk about taking a step forward, then doing a backflip on a trampoline and falling face first on the metal rim. If the Aincrad arc is a decent arc with hit or miss episodes, then the Fairy Dance arc is one gigantic botch. Even devoted SAO fans admit that this arc is bad, and pretty much everyone who has at least heard of the show knows why it’s bad. Unanimously, making Asuna the worst case of damsel in distress I ever seen in any show was a horrible idea. 
Now, to be fair to this arc, the story concept of the Fairy Dance arc looks good on paper – a guy wants to save the girl he loves who is trapped in a MMO. Sounds pretty neat. The problem? Whereas the Aincrad arc is set in an epic ‘we gotta save world’ centered story, Fairy Dance arc is Kirito and Asuna’s personal story. Well, aside from the Big Bad wanting to brainwash people, because reasons. However, because there was little investment in their relationship, it’s very difficult to be invested with the story of Kirito wanting to save Asuna. People might find joy in this arc if they are already invested with their relationship back in the Aincrad arc. 
What was awesome!
The boss battles!! They’re awesome! Especially the one where Kirito busted out his secret technique on that Minotaur jabronee!
Yuki Kajiura is one of the best composers in the industry, and she does another great job composing the score for SAO. 
Asuna is a pretty cool heroine. If only Fairy Dance didn’t exist…
The first three episodes are some of the best opening episodes I’ve seen in any show. What a way to start! Honorable mentions go to the side quest with Elisabeth (possibly the most wasted character in the show), the two episodes where Kirito and Asuna explore the dungeon and the last few episodes. 
Overall
SAO had a lot of potential, but never fully tapped into it. The Aincrad Arc is pretty decent. There are hit and miss episodes, but overall serviceable, and serves as a gateway for people who want to get into Anime. It’s by no means perfect, but it is enjoyable to watch. If only the show was not hyped up to be the Lord of the Rings of Anime, it would have taken away so much expectations for the show and would have been more enjoyable. It’s by no means a great show, but isn’t one of the worst. 
If Fairy Dance still kept the same story, but followed different characters (and removed all the incest, cut out all the time wasted on not realizing your crush is your brother-cousin, incinerate any storyboard drawings of sexual molestation, and a better villain), then the arc would be at least decent on the level of the Aincrad Arc. 
For real, screw Fairy Dance. It’s not worth watching. Not even for Leafa’s, y’know, personality…",5
"
                To start things off, the reason why i even decided to watch this. I have this one friend who always freaks out over a lot of anime adaptations of the light novels in which he reads. But man was he really freaking out over this one. In the beginning i was not really interested in watching this but he , for the love of god, would not shut up about it and kept nagging me to watch it. So just to stop him i decided to pick it up.
Story:  I am going to separate this into two parts. 
FIRST ARC: SWORD ART ONLINE: 9
I
                  found the best part of this anime was the first arc of the story which was set in Sword Art Online, which was the name of the anime. At the time when this came out, people were still in the hype of playing Diablo III and people were going nuts over how Sword Art Online is just like watching Diablo III Hardcore mode, where if you die, you die for reals. But this added a touch where if you die in the game you would die in real life, i then can already tell there is going to be a lot of drama that is to come, and i LOVE drama. The story was great, i am not really sure how to describe it, it is cliche in that there is a hero and he gets really strong and overcomes obstacles every single time one is thrown at him, but even though it was super cliche'd the process, the execution was pretty damn great. I don't really want to say too much about it, I will leave it to you to watch and see for yourself.
SECOND ARC: ALFHEIM ONLINE: 7
As far as story goes i would say that this was not as amazing as the first one. Because there was not crazy penalty for dying it made it seem a lot less intensive which was one of the things that made the first arc really great. If you die in this one you just have to wait for a resurrection time, that's it. What is interesting to me about this arc was the ability to fly and that you have no levels, everything is from your own skill. That part of Alfheim Online is pretty cool. 
The plot of this arc is pretty creepy and messed up, that is not to say that the first arc's plot wasn't messed up, just this one is a lot more creepy and messed up. Sugou, that bast*rd man, wants to have his way with Asuna and change 300 people's brains and altering them, adding emotion, adding memories, deleting memories and what not. 
This arc had a few great points but overall i did not enjoy it as much as the first arc. That is not to say it was not enjoyable.
Art: 9
The art was pretty great. It was calming to watch during the calming times and it was intensive when there was a crazy battle scene. They did a great job with animating the emotional faces. It looks pretty simple at a glance but i think it can go further than that. 
Sound: 8
The sound of this anime goes well with all of the scenes. It has this medieval feel to it, since the game is set on a medieval time period. OR I ASSUME. I am pretty bad at classifying these kinds of things. Opening 1 and ending 2 were my two favorite songs in this anime. Opening 1 was Crossing Fields sang by LiSa, She does a really good job and when i first heard it, i thought that it really worked well for what Sword Art Online was at that time. It felt adventurous. Then the ending 2, Overfly sang by i forgot who was really great too. It was due to it's somewhat rising tension feeling it gave when it began. It started off slow and it rose, and had this rush feeling to it which really reflects well on the second arc where Kirito was in a rush to save Asuna.
Character: 9
Kirigaya Kazuto: 
This guy is just so damn cool. He acts normal and chill when he's not in battle and when he is in battle he is completely courageous and strong. I can't really say to much other than  I like this kind of main character. 
Yuuki Asuna:
At first i thought this character was kind of cool, it is nice to see a really strong and cute female that fights and is totally badass. But as the series progresses i somehow feel myself liking her less and less but still ended up liking her though.
Kirigaya Suguha:
Continuing from above, as i start to like Asuna less i started to like Suguha a lot more, I am not really sure why but something about her just makes me feel like she's a better character than Asuna. 
The characters in this anime was great, even during the second arc of Alfheim Online, i would still time to time think back to Klein or Mills and hell even heathcliff. I just think that they were amazing characters. 
BUT THERE WAS ONE CHARACTER I TOTALLY HATED ASIDE FROM SUGOU. F**KING RECON. MAN HE JUST SUCKS. THIS IS SOLELY MY OPINIONS AND I REALLY HATE HIS A*S.
That is all for characters. LOL
Enjoyment and overall: 8
After i watched the first arc and two episodes into the second one i actually dropped this anime because i did not really like the plot of Alfheim Online and it seemed pretty inferior to the first arc so i dropped it. Then many months later i decided to pick it up once more and i am pretty glad that i did. I thoroughly enjoyed this and i hope if they ever make more it would be as good as this.
Til next time

                *WARNING! This review contains spoilers, some big, some little, some CATASTROPHIC and some irrelevant, so please be careful and enjoy!
You know, I totally had no idea what I was going to review next. I mean, I had started writing a review for Digimon Adventure with the hopes of making it sound epic and nostalgic but after near enough 3 months of trying and failing…..a lot! I just kind of gave up and really couldn’t find any motivation anymore to review anything.
But then….something happened. Something that had been in the pipelines for over a year up until now, something that I desperately waited for during it’s
                  dubbing (even when it took that break that TOTALLY didn’t frustrate me ¬_¬). Something! That I’ve seen and heard talked about OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER again over that past year, all it’s highs and lows, the disappointing second half, the badass fights, killer art, shit-hot female lead and of course THAT tentaclethingthathappenedtoallyoutofnowherethatwastotallyunnecessaryandstillcreepy.
Yes, I am of course talking about Sword Art Online, so without further ado:
Otaku’s, Otakette’s & the Young’ins. I present to you, my completely spontaneous review of Sword Art Online. CUE THE MUSIC!!!
As always, History class is first so I hope you’ve all done your homework or it’s DETENTION FOR ALL MWAHAHAHAHA!!!
Sword Art Online logged on to Japanese screens in 2012 between July & December. It appeared on Western screens in July 2013 and will keep airing until February 2014 apparently even though I’ve already seen it all in English, or maybe that’s just in Britain? It ran for 25 episodes and was produced by A-1 Pictures, known also for Black Butler 1 & 2, Fairy Tale, Blue Exorcist and it’s movie, Anohana and it’s movie, Silver 1 & 2 and later this year SAO 2 which I am major stoked for. The Director for this show is Tomohiko Ito, who’s other works (not all as director) include Death Note, Madoka Magica, Blue Exorcist, Anohana, Silver Spoon, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summer Wars.
So yeah, as far as anime production and directors go……big guns.
Story
Based on the on-going light novels, the first season of SAO covers the first two arcs in the light novel (I expect the second season to cover the third and fourth arcs respectively) and is set in 2022 where a new craze in online gaming has been invented called VRMMORPG or Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Role-Playing Game (try saying that when your drunk) which has been achieved with an item called the NerveGear, which is just this big-ass Elfen Lied helmet that basically puts you in a coma while you’re playing the game and allows you to control everything your avatar does with your mind. The show establishes in like the first minute or so that this event, let’s say, is selling like ice cream on a 50 degree (Celsius) day, and if you watch the show later on to the point when all the characters are introduced and you remember them then re-watch the first episode and you’ll see this sweet cameo. Or well I thought it was sweet at least. 
We are then introduced to our main character in the real world whose real name is Kazuto Kirigaya, but, in the world of Sword Art Online, he is the god-child (or he might as well be seeing how OP he is), Kirito. Now Kirito was one of a very lucky 1000 people who got to Beta test SAO (bear in mind only Japan has this game) before release, because he is mad into his MMO’s (you’ll find the reason why that is later in the show) and thus has a technical head-start over everyone else, which people ostracize or single him out on calling him a Beater, a combination of Beta and cheater. Now, Kirito, is a solo-player (again, something that has reason to it which you find out later) and just doesn’t like to play with or be around other people, plain and simple, which as an MMO’er myself is something that DOES NOT get you very far, but he’s the God Child, so what the hell do I know.
So in the first episode after everyone logs in we see Kirito do his thing and make a friend named Klein. After a long day of training, Klein decides it’s time to log out, but there’s a problem……the logout button is missing sparking massive panic when suddenly all the players are gathered into the town square where an announcement is going to be made, a mysterious figure appears and proclaims that he is the creator of Sword Art Online, Akihiko Kayaba (whose second name I always mixed up with Kaiba).
Kaiba then announces to all these players that they are trapped inside Sword Art Online indefinitely until they complete all of the game’s 100 floors and then defeat the final boss, Kaiba himself. But wait, there’s a catch, if they die in the game, they will also die…….in the real world, sparking a huge WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA- jaw dropping reaction from me and every player in the game, then he lets off a light fart and just toodles off, not really, but yeah.
And that’s it. Like the players your just left with that massive revelation and just kind of have to deal with it………..ON TO EPISODE TWO!
See, now this, is how you open up an anime and set that shit up to be fucking EPIC! And it was, sort of, up until episode 14…..of 25 I may add, where it ended. Or at least Sword Art Online: The Game ended. More on that later, look for the “***”.
After such a gripping opening, for the next three episodes, it just keeps on gripping you even tighter. The show throws epic boss battles at us, sad feels, happy feels, epic questing, an epic female lead and some “people die when they are killed” moments. But also raises suspicions about the show having a slight Harem element to it.
Which takes me to my next point, the show has this really noticeable Harem side to it, where in every single new female character that Kirito encountered, A.K.A. in every episode, they instantly fall in love with him the second he does some random badass thing, like that’s all MMO girls care about. It does calm down later on, but as with game development, when one issue is resolved, another just pops up. And SAO is no exception with it’s next problem after Harem, being pacing.
Apart from the second half of this show, the pacing of the first half is the next worst thing, with the anime cramming 2 whole years of these people being stuck in this game in constant life or death situations every single day into FOURTEEN FUCKING EPISODES! With episode-to-episode time skips anything between two weeks and a few months, give or take on these, I didn’t really pay all that much attention to the dates, but I still noticed it. It bothered the heck out of me when I did.
Now another thing that bothered me about the cut-off being at episode 14, was the fact that the whole idea of saving themselves from SAO was just shat on completely and canned with a Deus-Ex Machina way on floor SEVENTY FUCKING FIVE! Akihiko Kayaba was canned as well, which pissed me right the fuck off and the answer to all our questions weren’t fucking answers, because all Kaiba said was, “Oh, I can’t remember why I did what I did. But hey, isn’t that a nice castle?” ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ON MY BALLS!? Granted I understand that this is a faithful adaptation of the light novels I get that okay but, FUCK THAT SHIT! What a goddamn waste of time, I thought to myself. Why the fuck put such a massive bombshell on us like that, traumatize our characters for two years, tell them they have to clear ALL 100 FLOORS, defeat EVERY BOSS and give us all these questions shrouded in mystery just to throw it all away on a whim and replace it with a FUCKING FAIRY GAME! Oh, wait, I’m getting ahead of myself……ahem!
***
At this point in time, I was done with the show, D-O-FUCKING-N-E, done. But the only thing that kept me going was the romance between Kirito and Asuna, which I’d love to go into detail on but I’d rather not at this stage. When they got together and the show took itself away from the major dilemma and just gave us, or those two rather, some respite just to live as people and in love. They get a house, they get married, hell, they even have a daughter, which surprised me so much because they actually went in that direction and how far they actually took it, so much so that it took me to a place that I am still recovering from (insert Clannad photo here) and it completely left me speechless. 
So imagine me, done with the show but still invested in their romance, when Kirito wakes up in the real world as Kazuto now and finds out that Asuna hasn’t woken up and is still trapped in a re-hashed version of SAO called Alfheim Online and decides to go and save her. My reaction was like, “Aw really, goddamn it. Fuck it, I really want a happy ending”. So I watched the first few episodes of the second half of the season and instead of me explaining what sucked, I think 
I’ll just paste the Facebook status I made about it…………..
“My reaction to Sword Art Online's second half (so far ¬_¬):
What!? What is this? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are YOU!? What the fu-? Are we really going there? WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!? Don't you fucking touch her you cunt! Are we REALLY going there!? What the fuck is this shit!? What the....fairies? FUCKING FAIRIES!? No, no, no, FUCK! Fuck this shit, fuck this show, fuck fairies and fuck you!!!
Still watching 3 episodes later ¬_¬...........fuck you!”
So yeah, I was PISSED. But, love prevailed ultimately and I kept watching and the show just kept trying to push me away with things like Princess Incestia……..more on that later. In the end, after suffering through the worst villain ever who just so happened to be the creepiest fucking guy and the most bullshit Deus-Ex Machina win ever, I finally made it to the end and got the happiness that I, Kirito and Asuna finally deserved.
Characters
Kazuto Kirigaya
I want to start off with Kazuto Kirigaya, the real-life counterpart of Kirito. Before going into Sword Art Online, Kazuto is a very reclusive and distant boy from his family, more so his Sister (who’s actually his Cousin), Suguha after finding out at 10 via the internet that his mother and sister are actually his Aunt and Cousin. His real parents died in an accident. So he just removed himself from their lives and gave himself fully to online gaming. This whole singular persona of his real life is the reason why Kazuto always plays alone. During SAO, after meeting various female characters he starts to change as a person and realize that he should stop ignoring his Cousin and be a better big brother to her and through Asuna, finds love and a reason to go beyond just simple online games and find his place in the real world, she basically gives him his only reason for being real. After Kazuto wakes up from SAO he completely is the changed man he became inside the game but has to go back into the game to save his one reason for being in the real world and wanting to live in it. Personally I think Kazuto goes on such a great personal journey to go into the game as the guy he is full of resent and trust issues with no need of anyone else to then come out of the game with a new perspective on life, making an effort with his family and actually needing someone to keep him going, genuinely depending on them.
Kirito
Now Kazuto’s avatar Kirito is just the most badass over-powered thing to ever happen to an MMO, this guy power-level’s so bad that he can single-handedly take out floor bosses. Kirito is everything that Kazuto isn’t when he first enters the game. He’s strong, confident, charismatic, tactile and sure of himself. Kirito at first is all out for himself in this determined lone wolf warpath to blast through the game and beat it to save everyone trapped inside. He completely believes that it is his responsibility to save everyone and that he is the only one capable, because of the freedom of being alone. It comes to bite him in the ass, when a party he is with is massacred right in front of him, which he blames on himself for having lacked the power to save them even at his higher level and he slumps into depression and shows a new steely determination to beat the game. He hooks up with Asuna later on in the show and the two decide to take a break in the country with each other, away from all the danger wherein they develop a love for living in the world of SAO as opposed to the real world. 
They are eventually forced back into the game however and after finally beating the game and waking in the real world to find Asuna still trapped, Kirito must go back into the game on another warpath, but to save the love of his life from being lost to the game forever….basically. That threat is big enough, but Kirito just seemed at times in the second half to just completely forget all about why he was in Alfheim Online to begin with, just nonchalantly flirting with random women, and when women flirted with him he fucking gives it back. Why can’t he just say, “oh, sorry, I’m married”? He also totally disregards his mission TO SAVE HIS WIFE to solve some random dispute that people may die in, that has fuck all to do with him and his mission. In a game where if you die, YOU RESPAWN. On that note, Kirito is REALLY pretentious in the second half. Right, sure, being trapped in SAO for two years would have traumatized him and left a mental scar that prevents him from wanting people to die in the game, but that doesn’t mean shit when you completely accept that fact the minute you start playing the game, like seriously, yeah you died, just wait ten minutes and respawn and try again, what’s the big fucking deal? But all in all I do enjoy Kirito for all of his admirable qualities, pretentious or not and for how happy he makes Asuna.
Asuna
The character of Asuna is presented to us as a complete and utter badass, a beautiful one at that. She, like Kirito at the beginning is full of determination in beating the game. She has some wicked swordplay in her trunk and after partying with Kirito for a while becomes a good friend to him, with the more time they spent together allowing Asuna to become a more free player and start to enjoy herself a bit more. She then falls in love with him and sort of takes a less prominent badass role in the show. I’ve seen a lot of people shun this move as completely shutting her character off and making her a weak cry-baby, but that is far from the truth, she’s still a badass, she just takes a backseat is all. She personally relaxes and takes it easy. I personally preferred laid back badass Asuna to always serious and fighting badass Asuna. I fell in love with the laid back Asuna because she was more real and came across as so relieved to be allowed to be completely herself. Her love for Kirito extends into her love for Kazuto, as them being together will release her from her pressured life in the real world, where she won’t have to worry about her parent’s expectations of her and just live happily with Kazuto. She is definitely a strong female character and is certainly one of my favourites.
I want to do a quick mention on Yui, Kirito & Asuna’s in-game daughter who is just the most adorable little thing and the reason why the show took me within Clannad emotions. She brings some wonderful childish heart to the show.
Another quick mention for Princess Incestia, A.K.A. Suguha Kirigaya, A.K.A Kazuto’s sister/cousin who wants to desperately shag him, because, well, incest…..why the fuck not I guess, huh? 
NO!? WHAT ARE YOU STOOPID!? 
Stupid fucking character, stupid fucking incest sub-plot. 
She’s got plot I guess so that’s makes it all better, yeah? Fuck no! Go home.
Art/Animation
If A-1’s credentials are anything to go by then you don’t need me to tell you how good this show looks, but I will anyways. This show is a goddamn visual masterpiece, like seriously, sure you can get away with saying the characters aren’t anything special, but even then they still look great and varied. It’s the environments that steal the show though, as we are constantly treated to the most stunning vistas I think I’ve ever seen in an anime. They are truly unbelievable at times and some, like the World Tree and it’s main town are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Animation is a visual masterpiece as well, with action and fight scenes that kick the absolute shit out of virtually every Shōnen before it. It makes the fights in Bleach look like they were conceived by a baby with a full nappy. Your heartbeat will sky-rocket during every single fight in this show, guaranteed.
Sound
The soundtrack for Sword Art Online is done by Yuki Kajiura, so no explanations needed other than it’s not as good as you’d expect but it’s still a pretty good soundtrack. Notable songs include:
Swordland
A Tender Feeling
At Nightfall
The first opening is Crossing Field by LiSA and although I do like it, it, like the show is way over-hyped.
The first ending theme is Yume Sekai by Haruka Tomatsu and it’s okay I guess, it’s nothing special.
The second opening is Innocence by Eir Aoi and I think it is as good as Crossing Field just without the recognition.
The second ending theme is Overfly by Luna Haruna and is leaps and bounds better than Yume Sekai. It’s a really good song.
Now for the dub cast:
Bryce Papenbrook; Rin Okumura in Blue Exorcist and Red in Pokémon Origins, voices Kirito/Kazuto which is quite weird because the whole time watching I thought that it was Derek Stephen Prince who was doing the voice because Kirito sounds an awful lot sometimes like Uryu Ishida from Bleach.
Cherami Leigh; July in Darker Than Black and Lucy Heartfilia in Fairy Tale, voices my soon to be wife Asuna.
Stephanie Sheh; Orihime Inoue in Bleach and Yui Hirasawa in K-On!, voices Yui.
Kirk Thronton; Gabumon in Digimon and Jin in Samurai Champloo, voices Klein.
Patrick Seitz; Isshin Kurosaki in Bleach and Marco Owen in King of Thorn, voices Agil.
Cassandra Morris; Ritsu Tainaka in K-On! and Kyubey in Madoka Magica, voices Suguha/Leafa.
All in all the voice acting in the dub is top notch from start to finish. I had no problems with any voice the entire time.
Enjoyment
Now, during the story part of this review I may have beat on this show a lot, or rather constantly, but let it be known that I’ve only beat on it so hard because of how much I love this show. I love this show so much, yes, even the dreadful second half I’d watch over and over again. This show was built for someone like me, someone who has poured months and months into MMO’s such as Runescape, WoW, LotR Online & Perfect World. I got so fucking hooked and hyped by the twist and the boss fights. Although I think that show is way, WAY over-hyped, I still loved the shit out of it on a more personal gamer level than as an anime watcher. The feels where handled marvellously and the show at times held my emotions on a shoe string which hasn’t been done since Clannad, so special props to that. It gave me a convincing and fleshed out (compared to others) love dynamic. All in all it was a great show and I am super looking forward to season 2. I would recommend you see or rather experience this in the majesty of Blu-Ray, there literally is no other substitute.
So yeah, that’s me finally done. I’m so glad I actually got to finish reviewing something. My next review definitely won’t take nearly as long, hell it may even be out in a couple days’ time. Look forward to it. It’s going to be on Kokoro Connect. So without further ado, thanks for reading, take care and go get some ramen! Geez I’m starving.
Getsuga TENSHOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8

                Right off the bat, this review will have some minor spoilers, so you have been warned.
This anime is yet another light novel adaptation, which right away gives one of the warning signs that it will very likely be a train wreck. Though with such wide popularity this must mean it has some worth does it not? Not exactly. 
The main issue of this series that is as plain as day is the time skips. We also only skim the surface of what the series brings up in terms of its themes. Nothing is explored in any depth that anime has not addressed before and in
                  superior fictional works. Being set in an MMO RPG, the unrealistic mechanics only serve to make Kirito overpowered, thereby leaving the show with no tension, not to mention the fact that Kirito comes back from the dead for no apparent reason twice I believe. The logic of the players also only serve to make Kirito smarter than he really is, since you'd think people would want beta testers to help them because they are their greatest asset to beat the game in the first half, why would they hate them even if they're cheating? Their lives are on the line. The series felt like it was trying to be to ""cool"" or ""hip"" for it's own good, rather than being a down to earth struggle for survival filled with hardship, teamwork (because that's what you do in an MMO to complete grand tasks) and drama/deaths that actually meant something beyond the first couple episodes. .hack//SIGN understood this years ago.
The side stories such as helping random one dimensional girls fall in love with him for no reason also serve zero purpose. Not to mention the death game ends midway through the show; the rest of the episodes are a completely different, non-deadly game. Half of the death game episodes are plotless fillers or  very rushed stories, or at worst just plain fan service. 
The second half also is completely pointless, with pointless ""political"" struggles between the races because it's just a game in the second half, an unexplored world and the really really poor written villain who is uninteresting and only exist to be seen as the bad guy, which is bad writing. 
Though despite my previous comments, I do see what the mass appeal is of this anime. And that is escapism and self insert protagonist. At it's core this show is about  wish fulfillment even if it pretends not to be, and one may find enjoyment at that level if one ignores all the things I said earlier. (Though I still question your taste)",3
"
                I'd like to make this review as short and as concise as possible given that I am only starting to create reviews. 
Most of the reviews that I read about SAO all talk somewhat negatively of the said anime adaptation of the popular novel series. I never read an entire volume myself but I tried to read a bit and I was utterly amazed at how different the novels are from the animation.
To tell the truth, I was hooked badly through the first episode. There's that great concept of survival and death playing around in the minds and hearts of all the players trapped in
                  the game. These concepts were well laid out in the first episode looking at the actions and conversations of the players. However, the great concepts were easily wiped out or dismissed as the story went by too fast. To be honest, I thought I was missing an episode during the first episodes. I had to look it up and found out that I wasn't missing any and that I was left puzzled by the odd flow of the story line. This goes on for the rest of the show which isn't that appealing.
The only that thing that was quite memorable from watching SAO are the animation and soundtracks I experienced as a viewer. It sent chills down my spine whenever a boss battle came up given the fantastic animation accompanied with killer BGM. I guess this can be considered as the strong point of SAO.
I thought the protagonist, Kirito, was too overpowered and lucky to have all the perks in playing SAO and ALO. Well, he outshines the other players which isn't that great of a build for a protagonist. I wouldn't expect the story to improve if the protagonist has already the powers and perks you would expect that he would only attain in the end. Also, talking about the different characters. Some, I found irritating and some truly unnecessary which also degrades the whole story line in a sense. 
Having SAO as an anime adaptation of what we experience through MMORPGS was a little letdown. I was a bit disappointed with the execution as it left out crucial and critical concepts that could have been very much enjoyable for the common everyday MMORPG player, gamer, anime addict or even escapists all around.",6
"
                This anime was a real disappointment it was hyped up by so many people but I just cant see why. The anime should have just stopped at episode 14.
The first half of the anime was very cute and I started to enjoy the cuteness but it did get very boring when they competently changed everything so there could be 3 episodes with two character settling down in an log cabin. There seemed to be very little character development with the main he was just so boring. It wasn't all bad there was some interesting combat and some cool moments. At episode 14 I was ready
                  for a disappointing end.
But they couldn't just end it they made a second half this was the most boring overemotional thing I have ever seen, they force in a wired love triangle that just so happens to be with his cousin. One of the coolest characters turns into a snivelling coward and everything just doesn't make sense like why did the game spawn him in a different location then the admin guy didn't even know he was there yet.
This anime is overrated as hell there is nothing in this anime to hook you in apart from all the cuteness that goes over the top to the point that it becomes like you are watching a fan fiction of what someone else thins should happen.",4
"
                I had heard a lot about this anime before watching it, about it's 'pretty' art style and how great it was overall, so obviously I was excited to watch it. Although I had heard it was a load of rubbish, I though it couldn't be that bad. And so I gave it a go; what a mistake.
It started off good, and the anime was pretty. But that's all I can say that is positive. An animes art shouldn't be what stops you enjoying it, or makes you enjoy it. It should be the story, the characters, their development and how well the anime fits into
                  it's category whether action, romance or other that helps you determine whether an anime is a masterpeice or a pile of crap.
Kazuto, or Kirito, acts like the deaths of hundreds of people effects him, and yet he didn't offer them any knowledge he had obtained when playing the game previously, which would have increased their chances of survival massively.
However, I think that the worst part of this anime is the 'romance' aspect. I didn't see anything build. Just because it occurred later in the series, doesn't mean it built, it just means it happened later in the series. One minute Asuna and Kirito were just in the same team, then BAM they're married and having a girl call them mummy and daddy. It went from an action anime one moment, to a really crappy romance that lacked any real character development.
I wouldn't recommend it, to anyone in all honestly. Well, unless they like an anime that can't make up it's mind.",3
"
                This show is pretty famous for either how bad it is, or how amazingly epic it was. I will try to give an unbiased opinion of this show, and explain why I think it's worth watching, and some of its downsides.
First of, the show, Sword Art Online, if not already known, features Kirito, a gaming addict that was a beta tester in SAO, as a protagonist. The show revolves around the Virtual World in SAO, Aincrad (An INCarnating RADius).
Anyway, the story as itself is a pretty interesting idea. To be able to fight and exist on a realm besides the Real World. The battle scenes
                  in the show are pretty amazing and rather epic, in my opinion. Because it is on a virtual MMORPG, you would expect skills and such. The show was able to pull the effects off as something that looked both digital, but fatal as well. The OST, done by Yuki Kajiura, although not her best work, was pretty decent and fitting for most of the show. The OP and ED were decent from my point of view, and I thought was pretty fitting with the show. So enough said about that. Thumbs up for that.
On a personal level, I enjoyed it quite a lot. Namely because it was the first show that brought me back to the anime realm. Also, I suppose it might be a main character thing, but I believe there are many guys out there who'd like to fight like Kirito, or at least one of the characters, in the game. So, well, it kind of made me feel really happy. And I would give it a 10/10 for my personal excitement. Personal. Keep note of that.
Things were going great in the first arc, with nice fights and graphics. But I noticed that in the second arc, the quality dropped by quite a bit. The fight scenes were less badass and epic as the first half, and was quite a let down. Even the magic wasn't as cool as I had hoped. With exception of the bridge demon scene. That was pretty amusing. So it's understandable how people became dissatisfied with the show. The expectations of the first bit kinda made second bit seem really bad.
Another thing that has been mentioned countless times is Kirito's 'harem'. I use the inverted commas, because it's not a harem. It is clear cut that Kirito and Asuna are canon. Nothing else. Before the romance with her, however, he had met other players like Silica, Lisbeth, and Sachi. While Sachi is disputable, the author of the story decided to pair him up in the end. For comparision sake, a harem would be a show where the main character doesn't choose a girl in a blatant outright manner, like Ichijou from Nisekoi doesn't say out ""I love you, Onodera."" He thinks it, and doesn't decide between any of the girls he has. But Kirito chose Asuna. In fact, there were times where he met guys on his journey. But perhaps the animation company decided that only including the girls would make it more appealing. (Wait, would that give openings for yaoi... Okay moving on.) In summary, I believe that the argument of calling Sword Art Online a 'sucky harem anime' is invalid as it isn't technically a harem.
I must admit, the character development is near to non-existent. Kirito transforms from a VRMMORPG addict with no life, to a VRMMORPG addict with no life, with a girlfriend. He complains about having a lack of strength, but doesn't do anything about it. He just gets someone's shoulder to cry on when that happens. So once more, really annoying side to the story. Asuna, in fact, takes a step back, from timid VRMMORPG gamer to confident badass lightning fast commander of the Knight of Blood, and finally to weak princess who whimpers in her cell. It seemed as though having Kirito to protect made her less powerful. While she did attempt to escape, it was pretty weak, and careless, of an attempt.
Ah, don't forget the ending, right? The horrible deus ex machina at the end. Remember that he is just a noob in ALO. But oh wait, he kicks ass in the end. Why? Because SAO and ALO are linked. Heh. No that's not a spoiler. They say it at the start. Honestly, the battle at the end isn't even worth calling epic. Or a battle at all. It was a one-sided duel. Pretty much all of us knew he was going to win one way or another. But they picked a bad way to do it. That was a key point of the show that many people, including myself, were disappointed with.
While many didn't like the second arc, I have to say, logic-wise, it has a little bit of basis. Sorry if I spoil anything. In a nutshell, Asuna belongs to a wealthy family. But wait, this family is the one who made the NervGear. In parts of the world, arranged marriages are still acceptable. For the man in-charge of creating the NervGear to marry his comatose daughter to a man from another Virtual-Reality-related company is not something rare. Just so happened, that the man was a scheming little ass, and decided to manipulate the game into his field, so he could have Asuna, making her seem like one of the few 100 poor victims that were an excuse for his science experiments and marriage. And of course, why waste time holding the marriage of to a time where Asuna wakes up and can reject the marriage? Therefore arrange it such that Kirito has limited time, unlike in SAO where he had pretty much as much time as he would like.While the story is arguable, I find it reasonable to an extent, and I think, that while it seems draggy and unnecessary, it was the writer's decision. Personally, not looking at logic, I thought it was slightly fine, though clearly very rushed. In fact, the show missed out on a scene, where Kirito and Lyfa go into ALO's Underworld an are stuck there. Which pretty much sucked. I was hoping it'd be in an OVA or something (hint hint, producers).
In conclusion, I think Sword Art Online is a show with several good points, but several bad points as well. To anyone whose judgement of this show was influenced by anything at all, you poor thing. It made you either a person that overrated the show, or bad it sound like it was third rate crap made by a 10-year old. Either way, it continues to destroy the expectations that people originally held for the show.
In conclusion to my conclusion, I think this show is something that should be watched WITHOUT the opinions of anyone influencing you. Anime, not just SAO but everything, is not something you can compare side by side. Like you wouldn't compare Sherlock to Supernatural (I don't watch either, I am so sorry if I made any mistakes about that.), since they have different stories based on different concepts. So, I think it's unjustified to compare something, even in the same theme like Btooom!, to another show. If you have read this review before watching, fear not, just ignore everything (or at least most of it, except for this: If you're one for action and fantasy (with a slight bit of sci-fi), I suggest you watch the show. you might enjoy it.
I hope this has helped. Thanks!",7

                SAO is not a bad anime, but it is not necessarially a good anime either.  Being a huge fan of the idea of being able to interact with a virtual world without having to move your physical body, I was very interested in the idea of this anime. Sadly, it leaves much to be desired.
Story: 7/10
There is a story contrary to what many think. To get the story, all you have to do is skip episodes 3-7 since they have no substance to the greater plot and are based off of the second volume of the light novel unlike the rest of the first
                  arc. 
The second arc goes more into Kirito's relationship with Suguha. Unfortunately there is one scene that kinda ruins it near the end.
Art: 9/10 
It's not studio madhouse level of beauty, but it's still a very good art style
Sound: 6/10
The opening and ending themes are nice. The bgm can hardly ever be heard so that is quite a disappointment.
Character: 6/10
The characters aren't very well developed as time goes on. 
Enjoyment: 8/10
Even though the anime does have its problems, I still enjoyed it the whole way through
Final thoughts
Like I said, it's neither a good nor a bad anime. The light novel is far better than the anime so if you didn't like the anime, there is a possibility that you will like the source material a little more.
Total 7/10",7
"
                ""What would you do if you were trapped in a game where if you die, you die in the real world too? The only way to escape is to complete the game.""
Well, that's what the anime is basically. And, as the name suggests, it IS about sword fighting. And some really good ones to boot.
The anime boasts of a game like interface type of thing, which is pretty good.
Also, let your imagination run wild about the advantages of being in a game. Well, there are a little downs like sudden death, but dont worry YOU ALREADY KNOW YOU ARE SCREWED UP...
And there are the random
                  little romances here and there, bit of petals scattering about.
But the one thing that captures is the fighting. The kind of places you'll only expect in a MMORPG. Like a Weapons Shop or Dungeons. It IS a game after all...
If you are a gamer, you will like this.
My suggestion is that this anime is definitely worth a watch.",8
"
                           The first arc of this anime blew me away with originality and a fresh new story. I have to say I was astounded by the quality of the art and the intense detail that was put in to make it look realistic yet at the same time virtual. The OST's are incredible. You'll never get tired of listening to them. Usually I skip through the intros and outros of animes after I listen to them once, but SAO kept me coming back for more. The character development was on point. One of the hardest
                  parts of watching anime that span through a long timeline is pacing. SAO tied each episode perfectly and they were lined up in tandem, even though there was a time gap between them. 
     The second arc of the anime was completely underwhelming and unsatisfying. It felt completely cliche and absolutely bored me to death. I can say that the fight scenes are very interesting though and they kept me chugging through the final episodes. I really wanted to like the second arc because of how much the first arc changed my perspective on the fantasy-RPG genre.  I felt like this anime would have been perfect if they had just stopped it after the first arc, but was still entertaining as a whole.",7

                Sword Art Online Written Review, Video Review is up on my Youtube
Have you ever wanted to live your life as video game. Don’t you just want to enter the video game world to have fun, and live your fantasy character the way you want. The catch is, the game you’re playing is a survival death game, you die in the gaming world you die in real life. Welcome to the first part of a 2 parter of Newin Anime Review and this is one of the most hyped up anime of 2012, Sword Art Online.
Story - 7/10
Bit of spoiler alert up ahead, but the Sword
                  Art Online series is broken up into arcs. When you get half way through the season, it’s a different arc. So there being a second season, you’re probably already going to know what happens, but anyways.
Sword Art Online story begins as players from all over Japan enter a VRMMORPG, Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, Sword Art Online. All goes well, until everyone in game realises there is no logout button, which was an intentional feature by the creator of the game, Kayaba Akihiko. He gives the players a goal, reach and complete level 100 of the game and gain your freedom. Seems easy right, it’s a game you can’t die…wrong. If you die in Sword Art Online, you die in real life, no respawns.
The second half of the season is a different story, but a continuation from the first half. It’s focuses more on family and love and willingness, people are ready to go through to save one another. In short it’s a rescue a locked princess story, which is not as interesting as the first half. Maybe because the stakes weren’t as high.
Here is where people have problem with the story of Sword Art Online, it started off well, interesting concept and the stakes were high. It did a good job of making people feel emotional of when a character does die, the other characters really feel it, like they’re a trapped and there is no hope. And when the second half of began, it kind of made the first half a little less enjoyable, as it felt like a stepping stone for something bigger, which it really wasn’t. 
However what the story does very well is the execution of video games. If you’ve played MMORPGs before, it plays it pretty well, such as characters doing fetch quests to gain a specific item, defeating bosses in a raid, it executes video game elements in an anime very well. 
Characters - 6/10
Sword Art Online series main protagonist is Kirito. Now Kirito sort of fulfills the role of your dream game character, he's overpowered and looks good while doing it, plus getting all the girls. Now Kirito starts off as a solo player, he only looks after himself and worries about his survival while also trying to be the best player in the game with the best items. His character actually develops rather well, starting as a loner, but grows to learn to help others around him, how he needs others around him to get through the game in order to beat it. It is kind of annoying how he feels like an overpowered character, defining the laws of the game and just being super high level than everyone else, but I guess that sort of make sense if he doesn’t share exp. with anyone, since he plays solo.
Asuna fulfills the role as the lead female protagonist, and Kirito’s love interest. She comes in as a novice player theoretically, but her execution in gameplay and her swordsman’s skills are high level. Here is where I have a problem with her character, she starts off as a great strong potential female lead character, however after her first appearance, she becomes sort of a whiny annoying character, relying on Kirito a lot. And it doesn’t help the fact that during the second half of the season, she is neglected to a hopeless damsel in distress character. 
The main female lead protagonist for the second half of Sword Art Online is, Leafa. They kind of tried to play the card as Kirito’s love interest for the second half of Sword Art Online, but you know it wasn’t going to work out for reasons. She is a more stronger lead than Asuna, that’s because her character seems to have more of purpose, she is Kirito’s guide, but in the end even she gets kind of pushed aside to make way for Kirito. 
Every other character in SAO, are pretty much neglected characters. Most characters that appear in the show, only appear once before probably making a cameo appearance at the end. Because these characters only appeared in one episode, you make thing to yourself is this a filler episode? At points yes, but it’s more to stick with the theme of an online gaming world, where you move from one thing to other and kind of forget about what you did before. Does it make great material for storytelling…no. 
Also how come almost every girl that plays SAO is cute, beautiful and pretty etc. and they all kind of fall for our hero Kirito, makes me wonder, where the hell are all the gamer girls in my life. I swear to god there is more girls playing in SAO than there is boys, and most of them a ranked higher than the guys as well. I guess girl gamers a better than guy gamer.
Animation - 9/10
The animation and artstyle for Sword Art Online is superb, it really depicts what the gaming world should look like, and it’s a beautiful world with a vast variety of different locations. There  are also the nice added touch of gaming elements, such as when characters or bosses get hit, you see their wound in video game digital format, where the wound is pixelated. What I also like the fact is the little details they’ve put into the game interface, such as menu and huds, it’s those little things that make the game seem more like a real game. The action in the scene is unique as well, as when characters fight, their swords light up, so you can see what character is doing what attack, and the action scenes are well animated for that matter as well. Apart from a few hiccups here and there and some unnecessary fan service along the way the animation and art style is great, it really depicts the bright gaming world.
Enjoyment - 8/10
Sword Art Online probably appeals to a lot of people and the reason why it gets the hype is because, it appeals to the large majority of gamers. It’ll impress RPG players the most, but in general a lot of gamers can relate to the world these players are in, you feel like you want to be inside a game. To me SAO was enjoyable, because I’m a gamer as well, I can see the appeal it has to people. 
I enjoyed the action scenes in the anime, and my guilty pleasure to some extent is me wishing I was Kirito, because c’mon who doesn’t want to be a gamer and get all the girls at the same time as well. The story really grips you onto the first couple of episodes and mostly first half of the season, but there were probably way too many episodes that felt like side content and the second half I can see why people will not like as much as the first. 
Simply put the fact, the hype is because the majority are gamers. 
The soundtrack for SAO, I found really enjoyable to listen to, with LiSA - Crossing Field making a great opening song for the first half, and Eir Aoi – Innocence another great opening for the second half. The ending songs were great too, with the second one being more recognizable to me. 
Verdict - 7.5/10
So does Sword Art Online live up to its hype? If a 7.5/10 is the score, then kind of. It’s a good anime, but people are probably overhyping it too much because of their love for video games and Sword Art Online is their dream game. The story is good for the first half and played its emotional high stake theme well, but the second half is pretty generic and does no justice to some characters. The plot often gets distracted for too long before making any proper progression, and lacked proper character development here and there. But the animation is great, it looks good and creates that gaming world perfectly.

                Ah, here we go again. Normally I don't make that many reviews but in this case I should really speak my mind out about this anime. A few years ago I decided to watch it and the second season along with Ordinal Scale, I rated them all a 10 surprisingly. I decided to rewatch this yesterday just to remember the plot since I wanted to catch up on the series, now here's where it all goes downhill.
Now I get it where people come from when they said that SAO was trash and they're so right. Here we have Kirito with his edgy and happy ass
                  self and Asuna first starting off as a great strong woman but the huge turn in character change was when she became the damsel in distress after falling for Kirito. Before I complain more about the characters let me just say how trash the whole plot was.
When they all got trapped in the game, the huge timeline skip doesn't even make sense. It only mainly focuses on the game itself and how they are all going to get out; we don't get any background stories about the characters and flashbacks or just any real emotions for the whole time, nor we don't even see how families and other people react in the real world to the whole situation. It's like everything is so casual, a lot of that would have made a great storyline for it to fit in the anime just for the first season instead of throwing in some psycho guy that wanted to marry Asuna and locking her up in a god damn bird cage.
Now what really irks me is Kiritos cousin and yes there are other girls that are thirsty for him but she bothers me the most. THEY ARE COUSINS FOR GODS SAKE, we don't even get how Kirito was raised by his aunt and why even not bothering to tell them that they aren't siblings. I just think it's ridiculous that she fell in love with her own cousin, it ruins the whole anime even more just by thinking about it. Another thing that bothers me is Yui, she's one of the most useless and annoying characters. It's pure cringe when she became the child of Kirito and Asuna, I honestly laughed because of how bad the whole thing was when they all started playing house and what's even more funnier is that they're 16/17. I swear if they have a kid in real life I don't know what they're going to do with Yui in that case.
Overall, SAO had some great potential with the great animation they had back in 2012. The whole thing felt rushed and random miracles just came out of nowhere, at least The Seven Deadly Sins had a better plot for the first 3 seasons so far despite the hate it got for the latest animation.
I'm glad I made this review to clarify only the first season, I might not even bother to waste my time catching up on it since i'm sure it got way worse from there. 
I gave it a 4 just to be nice :)",4
"
                I watched this a year ago, and it was one of the first shows I had seen in a while. I thought the first half was interesting, and I honestly think it would have been perfect if the two had died and the show ended with the virtual world collapsing...but my god did the show nosedive afterwards. The elf arc not only had dumb looking character designs, but a whole weird ""rape"" thing going on... heathcliff was pretty cool though.

                An anime about multiple Virtual Reality MMO's. Here are some thoughts about Sword Art Online. I reference the description so there are not really any spoilers.
If you aren't interested in my wordy review, there's a breakdown below. 
It's a Philosophical and psychological delve into other virtual worlds. ""Diving"" as it's called in the series. A very interesting experience that plays upon advanced Virtual Reality, but not so advanced that it couldn't theoretically be done in the future. So what happens when people get trapped in the Virtual Reality and death in the game is equivlient of dying in life?
You get some intense half-hour episodes, thats
                  what! Haha
Seriously though, There is a lot going on, and it's really easy to keep track of everything across the episodes which was really nice.
Unfortunately, the overall concept isn't new. In fact, some of the main story the core of nearly every Rom Com out there. Plus being an anime about an MMO i find similarities between this and .Hack. And there's always the main character being a Hero thing. 
But those are things that you can say about almost everything and especially about anime.
Anyway now that you've read this far, you probably realize I like the series. 
Here's the breakdown
Story: 10
Why? 
VRMMO's make me excited. 
The world was built wonderfully.(ie no plot holes)
Time was believable, despite skipping over months/levels at a time
An above average action/Rom Com story with some nice twists.
Art: 8
Why?
Wonderfully designed.
Great style.
Above average character designs and Layout/Background designs
 - About average Animation. 
Sound: 10
Why?
If i want to own the soundtrack at the end of a series, i usually give it a 10.
I also like the ""fantasy"" sounding music, it helps the overall illusion.
Character: 10
Why?
Lots of characters with different personalities but easy to keep track of them.
Fun cliche's that are standard to pretty much any anime.
Enjoyment: 10
Why?
This may end up going on my top favorites. There were some great things here.
Overall: 10
Why?
I liked the series, very fun and lovable characters.
Other reasons-See above",10

                Okay, I'm not going in depth like a lot of people have because I hate this anime a lot and I know there may be some triggered people if I'm in depth. There is ONE minor spoiler in this review from one of the first episodes but I tried not to have any other spoilers.
SAO was actually the first anime I watched. I labeled that to Black Butler in my review of it but then I remembered SAO when it was too late. I'd say SAO was a TERRIBLE place to start. I didn't like it AT ALL. I mean, I sound like a hater
                  but I'm not that biased, but then again it's my opinion, not yours.
The art was good. Just your typical anime with special effects.  The animation didn't get lazy but a few times, which was good as well. I liked the character designs in all honesty, they were some very good designs, especially Asuna's. 
The sound was very good, no lie. But the voice actors for the dub could have been a bit better, but they were fine. My friend actually let me have a disc of the OST and I love it.
Now for what's wrong with the series. The first thing is the characters, specifically the Gary Stu we all know as Kirito. He's a black haired male with a decent portrayal, only fourteen in the beginning, and what happens? They make him a Gary Stu. All of the older girls fall in love with him, he is overly powered, all of that stuff.
The story isn't that good either. I mean, it's about people getting trapped in a video game and if they die they die in real life. Seriously? I expect better from any anime. 
Overall I rated 2/10. I dread this anime, and the only thing keeping it from a 1 was the art and sound. Terrible, I hated it.",2

                Ever wondered what it was like to live in a virtual reality? Where you can just escape from life and live out each day with nothing to worry about? These are some reasons why most of us today play MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game) games
Sword Art Online is about a young 14yr old boy named Kirigaya Kazuto IGN (In Game Name) Kirito who becomes trapped in the most new and anticipated VRMMORPG ""Sword Art Online."" Not only does he find himself trapped in the MMO but also along with thousands of players but their only means if escape is to clear the 100 floors.
                  This might sound like it isn't to bad but there's a catch, if you die in game you die in real life. As their struggle for survival increases so do the games difficulties.
Sword Art Online is definitely a fantastic Anime. Not only does it bring something different to the table for loving anime and MMO players one if the same to feed on but the characters in my opinion are lovable and well developed. Sword Art Online has to do with love, action, struggle, fantasy, drama comedy and basically any genre you can think of. Take my word for it, your going to want to watch it over and over again. One of the must see anime you will ever come across. The characters are amazing, Artwork is phenomenal makes you want to start drawing, the story leaves you on the edge of your seat with each episode having you craving for more and the soundtrack will have you spamming the replay button until it breaks. There's a reason why this anime is ranked high and the most viewed anime and top anime of 2012. Why's you ask?? Your just going to have to watch it and see :3",10

                Sword Art Online is the highly popular 2012 anime by A-1 productions. The basic premise is that a virtual reality MMORPG, called Sword Art Online, has basically trapped all of the players inside, as there is no way log out safely. 
Story: The story for this anime is rather typical, save for the twist on episode 15 of the first arc. It is about a very skilled player, previously a beta tester, named Kirito. It details the journey through the gauntlet-boss style 100 floor game, leading up to the finale of the first arc in episode 15. The story is average at best, being predictable
                  yet never boring. The second arc, however, was well below average. The pacing was sloppily done, the story itself didn't make a whole lot of sense, pulling a lot of deus ex machina's on the viewers. It definitely took a nosedive after episode 15.
Art: The art style itself is very A-1ish. It is well above average, but nothing amazing. The show has a bright color pallet, bringing out the fantasy side of the show. The animation is top notch, although the fight scenes are very sparse through the end of the first arc and the beginning of the second. But trust me, when they come, they are great.
Sound: People like to praise this show's music, saying it is one of Yuki Kajiura's best works; however, I disagree. The music, while being good, is no masterpiece. Both openings are catchy, but barely above average, and the OST itself is good, but only average for Yuki Kajiura. The dub is okay, doing what it needs to do. It is definitely not great, and I would recommend the sub over it any day.
Characters: The characters in this show were rather archetypal, making their actions rather predictable. Kirito is some sort of invincible Jesus-level gamer who never loses. Asuna is textbook tsundere. The other girls are so forgettable, that they aren't even worth mentioning. All the characters are so underdeveloped that it pains me to even talk about them.
Enjoyment: For me, this was the high point of the show. After all the shortcomings of this show (and trust me, there is no shortage of those), I still thoroughly enjoyed all 25 episodes.
Overall: This anime suffers from one thing: bad writing. At some points, it feels like it wants to be deep and edgy. At others, it feels like it wants to be a lighthearted slice of life comedy. At others, it wants to go all out balls to the wall action. The list goes on with this one. I feel like the premise was great, but the execution was very poor, making for a rather mediocre show. Good music and animation, great fight scenes, but it feels like its written by a middle school boy trying to be edgy. (Sort of like Mirai Nikki)
After watching this, I would recommend 2 animes:
Log Horizon: This one has the whole trapped in a video game premise going on, but it has much better writing and better pacing.
Fate/Zero: I recommend this one for the fantasy feel, the great fight scenes, and the great music.",6
"
                I will keep this short for you.
 SAO is an enjoyable anime with a few good fights and some funny moments. There are some downfalls, starting with how in a lot of episodes the protagonist Kirito for some reason seems to have girls falling for him left right and centre and he doesnt really do anything to justify this. He also seems to rocket up the skill level out of the blue and therefore the best player in the game. He works things out while everyone else seems to be picking their nose or scratching their ass.
however it is a fun watch when there isnt
                  any better animes on.",7
"
                At first when I heard about Sword Art Online, I thought to myself ""This is going to be crap so i'm not gonna waste my time watching it"" but then one day I decided to watch it due to all the praise I heard about it. Guess what though, I was right! After watching more and more of the series, the anime itself was already falling apart. There were big time skips, no character development, no feelings, etc. 
One of the biggest things I hated about Sword Art Online was how the creators just wanted to make Sword Art Online go longer so they decided
                  to add a useless arc which was Alfheim Online. I honestly didn't even know what the point of this anime was by the time I finished it. Was it escaping a game? Was it saving Asuna? Please, somebody tell me. I'm desperate to know.
It's something to watch while you're bored though but this anime would definitely not be on my favorites.",4
"
                Sword Art Online. This show had the potential to become the best anime I've ever seen. It's a shame then that it didn't act out it's full potential. 
1. Content
Sword Art Online takes place in the near future, where us humans can access vast virtual reality environments in which one can feel even more alive than in the real world. The virtual reality environment in which this anime takes place is a online multiplayer game called Sword Art Online. Without spoiling anything it suffices to say that it quickly becomes apparent that Sword Art Online is not what it first seems, and that the stakes
                  are much, much higher than anyone could've ever possibly imagined. 
Sword Art Online is an action-packed anime which quickly becomes centered around a lovely romance-plot. In my opinion the biggest flaw of this anime is the way this story is build up. The story takes a rampaging pace in the first few episodes, not taking enough time to build up. Huge time-skips between those first few episodes will leave you wondering if you missed anything. After the premise has been build up, however, you're left with a few of the most wonderful anime episodes I've ever laid eyes upon. 
Regretfully, halfway through the episodes the story quickly changes completely, which completely destroys all the build up. Allthough you'll probably keep watching because of your emotional investment in the story, it suddenly changes from a 9 to barely a 6. A new main character is introduced, and you're supposed to feel emotions for her which go against the emotions which the series has made you feel in the first half of the series. This makes it hard to relate to her and you'll just want to see the conclusion of the original story. Still, this second half does have it's great moments. 
The magic of the main plot lies in two of the main characters. The main character is very powerful. You can't say that he is overpowered though, since his abilities are explained. This character is well developed and he changes throughout the series through the things that happen to him. His motives are pretty deep, which is great for the depth of this show.
The second main character is a girl which is also given a great amount of screen time. She is pretty well developed, allthough I would've loved to see more of her developement at the start of this series (which, again, felt rushed).
The story quickly starts centering around a romance between them. This romance is obscured but also strengthened by the dire circumstances they find themselves in. This allows for a lot of touching moments and if you're into this kinda thing you'll soon find yourself very attached to both of the characters. This attachement will probably be the reason you'll keep watching the second half of this anime. I personally found the mix between romance and action to be great.
Regretfully, a lot of other characters are neglected. Most of them aren't given enough screentime to really get attached to them. I would've especially loved to have seen more of the main villains. They seem really well thought out, with a lot of background story. Unfortunately we only see a small portion of that background story. Still, in the screentime they have they are executed pretty well. At times you can really feel the hate for them burn up in your veins. 
Allthough this anime has a reasonably cheery mood, I think it would've been great to have the story be more dark and deep, with more care and developement to the side characters and without the big change in the middle. If I were the maker, I would've neglected the later episodes and made the buildup in the beginning slower.
2. Style
The artstyle of this anime is fantastic. The fights are wonderfully executed. They will pump your adrenaline and have you sitting on the edge of your seat. The characters all have their own twist in the way they look. However, in my opinion the thing best executed is the subtle contrast between the gray reality of the real world and the amazingness of the virtual reality worlds. The designs of the virtual reality worlds are epic, creative and still well thought out. Because this anime takes place in the very near future, it's possible to imagine yourself getting a virtual reality headset too. That gives this anime an extra layer of relatability. You, the viewer, could've been the main character, had you been born a few years later. 
The soundtrack is also great and fits well in the scenes. It is used in exacly the right moments and it really deepens the scenes out. At time it'll surely send shivers down your spine. I've only given this a 9 because I thought that the soundtrack of Attack On Titan was even better and even more epic, which means that the soundtrack of Sword Art Online could've also been even better than it already is.
3. Personal Enjoyment
All in all this anime has the most enjoyable romance plot I've ever seen. This is probably due to my personal preference of having romance mixed with action. To me, the first half of this anime is extremely enjoyable, while the second half is merely bearable. The flaws in the build-up and the lack of character developement completely ruïned this show from reaching it's full potential. Still, the great music, artwork and touching moments made this anime good enough to deserve an 8.",8

                Let's be honest right here: I can't review SAO as a whole. It has to be done in two parts. (EDIT: I carefully considered my options and decided not to ever finish this review. I either watch the ALO arc and grow to hate SAO with an intense passion, either just don't touch it and stay with my rather tender feelings for this wish fulfillment anime. I've agreed with the latter)
The distance between the flawed but extremely enjoyable Sword Art Online arc and the ALO part starting episode 15 is so huge that no one review can exactly define how badly everything goes wrong. 
SAO
                  has problems and is the most glaring wish fulfillment fantasy anime there is. But it is still watchable and enjoyable and I got into it in a big way. ALO is what happens when someone eats SAO, digests it, shits it out, then tries to make you eat it. The metaphor is actually very fitting since ALO is nothing but SAO done again in far, far worse.
So here's SAO, and I'll append ALO later:
Story: Bunch of guys get stuck in a virtual MMORPG world and have to finish the game to be let out. If they die in the game, they die IRL too. And they apparently take years to complete the game and nobody in the real world can disable or destroy the virtual reality helmet that's sending input directly to their brain.
In one sentence, this plot is bullshit. There is no way you can make me believe that a terminal, even one with mind control abilities, cannot eventually be turned off before the server sends a ""fry his brain"" command. 
But beside the bullshit premise? It's a cool occasion to see ""normal people"" get pushed in a situation where life and death are real and common, and where a whole world needs to be conquered and tamed. It's a cool idea, if used to death today. 
However let this be a rule for this review: I will point out bullshit and say that it doesn't matter. A lot of BS is in SAO and the show has pissed off a ton of people for good reason, but I find that quite a lot of this BS happens to be mostly inconsequential. Is the fact that everyone gets stuck in a VRMMORPG for YEARS bullshit? Yes. Does it matter if you get into the story at all? No. This might be an unfair rule, but I see BS in a huge amount of animes and they get passes too, so this one will as well.
So past the premise, the idea is fairly cool and more importantly than anything, the story is pushed to the sidelines here. SAO has a lot of filler and most of it is adequate filler for a wish fulfillment anime. This isn't aiming to be a social study, and as ""make me dream"" animes go, it strikes a fairly good balance of the MMO society, the characters interactions and life, and the difficulties they face in their lives. 
One of the bigger problems the story has is the ridiculously large ellipses(many episodes have entire months between one another) and how they clearly could've spent a lot more time characterising, but even then that's a flaw and not a deal breaker.
Art: It looks great for world shots. Character design is also really good. Rest of the environments are usually alright.
Sound: I remember liking a lot of the VA and the sound direction, and the swords clashing also gave a nice touch.
Character: OK. Now comes the real problem.
Story can be put aside if it's mainly about the characters, and SAO is like that. It's a basic plot of killing monsters to beat a game, and that's that. It's all about the characters and their interactions.
And the elephant in the room in SAO's case is of course its main protagonist, Kirito.
Kirito is a joke. An unfunny one. As characters go, he's a complete joke on us. See, the main thing about Kirito is that he's perfect. He's handsome(if you like babyfaces). He's always just a little taller or one head taller than the females around him. He's thin. He's a suuuuper strong gamer and sword user. He's always caring about everyone. He's always trying to help if you ask. He's, and this is where the joke comes up, always having the right words for all the situations. 
But the huge problem with this is that they try to pass Kirito as some kind of sad loner who doesn't get along with people and can't express himself properly.
At several points in the story Kirito is supposed to speak out to defend his good name. And he can't, because the poor boy just can't find it in him to express himself properly. And that same socially awkward boy will say literally the exact right perfect tailored words to a girl later on in that episode. He's a huge loner, but he has no trouble getting closer to a girl who seems to be without a party. He's a sad, sorry mess of a traumatised guy, but he is only because the plot basically shoved an extremely forced tragic battle situation on everyone.
Now again, SAO is about wish fulfillment. It's about appealing to every socially awkward teenage kid out there who plays a lot of videogames and thinks that deep down, he is a saint and a caring hero who just never got his chance to show himself.
As wish fulfillment goes, I'm perfectly fine with Kirito being the ""perfect boy"" he is. And I'm fine with every girl in the show wanting to ride his perfect dick.
If Kirito was one perfect guy amongst many, I'd say that SAO is crap because the characters are crap. But thankfully the rest of the cast usually does much better at being characters. Sure they're also ""perfect"" in many ways. The girls are all cute or hot. Asuna is basically a dream teenage girlfriend. Klein is your ideal best buddy. And no, that doesn't destroy SAO, because of one quality they all seem to have that Kirito doesn't have: they all seem human. Sure they're too nice, too hot and too this and that to feel real, but they all have very human traits. They laugh, they envy, they lust, they get greedy, they all feel at least a little bit human.
At least for the characters that remain in the main storyline.
The others have an extremely bothersome case of ""shut up and disappear"" every time. Let's say some girl gets romantically interested in Perfect Boy. At the end of the episode, you can be sure that she'll be telling him that she's sad, but she has to let him go, and that it's not his fault.
This is where the wish fulfillment gets a little sickening. You're breaking a girl's heart, so that would make you feel bad, right? So the anime literally tells you that it's ok, she's not mad at you. It just goes one notch too far in places.
Speaking of one notch too far, something needs to be mentioned about SAO: the forced plot points. There are many of them and they all ruin the fun to a degree. But I'll just talk about the most memorable one: in episode 3, Kirito gets into a tiny guild and they all die. The problem is, their deaths are forced at every turn. They go into a higher level dungeon despite Kirito saying no. They find a secret room and enter it despite Kirito saying no. They open a chest and get a trap sprung upon them despite Kirito telling them to wait and not open the chest. Then they all die, and Kirito has this emotional breakdown because all his friends are dead now.
And this forced plot point basically defines Kirito's behavior for the rest of SAO. It's a huge problem that doesn't go away with time: forced scenes, forced plot points, forced character reactions come in all the time, especially later in the show. IMO this is the worst part of SAO, both Kirito's inhumanity and the forced scenes drive it down a lot.
Enjoyment: This however is where it shines. Blatant as it was that SAO wasn't going to kill off Kirito or his main love interest, I felt genuine fear and pressure at difficult battles. I knew they weren't going to die, but I was still scared for them. This show has an undeniable talent at making you feel a sense of danger and battle, despite having no real danger of any kind for the two main heroes.
Overall: I honestly did not expect to enjoy SAO nearly as much as I did. I thought this would piss me off like Asterisk War or Qualidea Code or other crappy wish fullfillment medieval fantasy - sci-fi bullshit A1 Pictures anime. But it was surprisingly deeper, better built and more enjoyable than any of their other crap. This is a studio that is in every way the EA games of anime, all about quantity and name recognition and nothing for quality or originality. Yet here, the lack of originality at another ""stuck in another world"", the wish fulfillment protagonist, the generally forced moments, never took me out of it. I had fun, I felt things, I liked the main romance, I liked the fights, I liked pretty much everything. Kirito may be a dry sandwich that constantly says the right thing and all the other characters may be the better parts of the show, but it doesn't take out anything from it. 
It's strange to say, but you can be a ton of fun despite forced moments, a terrible protagonist and a very low-brow intent of making a huge ego-stroking wish fulfillment fantasy.
SAO was fun. SAO was great fun. It wasn't stupid, it wasn't terrible, and even though its lesser points certainly show that the intent was to appeal to our lowest desires and not in any way aim for the high road, to me it's just another proof that you can make a show run entirely on wish fulfillment and still make it fun and interesting if you do it right.",7
"
                Let's me preface this by saying that this series has HUGE flaws, terrible things that can't be denied, but even saying that, it is still immensely enjoyable for me. It's a great premise to start off with, an MMO avatar essentially becoming your one and only life. This can and does lead to thought provoking questions about what the 'real' world is. There's pretty much no reason to complain about the art, sound, and music as across the board they are all fantastic. Each opening and ending theme ties the overall emotion of the series together very well.
Now about the story, the MMO setting can
                  lead to pretty interesting plots about treasure in dungeons and people killing each other (which translates to actual murder). Plenty of mystery surrounds the story as well, like who set this trapped MMO up? Can they actually escape the MMO? Does killing another player in game really kill the IRL?  Now I'm not saying this series doesn't take advantage of the MMO setting and offer plots that can only happen there, but there are SO SO SO SO SO many other things they could have done with this premise. That said, I'm perfectly satisfied with what story is there. Why? Well because...
Kirito and Asuna's relationship.  This is by far what made the series for me. The whole MMO premise is really just icing on the cake if you ask me. Now it can be argued that their characters aren't the most inspired on their own (though they certainly aren't the bland people they're sometimes made out to be). They can both hold their own and battle, and are both charming in their own way. But together, precious. 100% precious. Especially when they get a 'daughter' Yui. The show even takes a couple episodes break just to build on their relationships. Admittedly this show is very poor at balancing all of it's other characters. They are all fairly interesting as well but I only wish they got their time in the spotlight.
It seems like the show is not very interested in its original premise. There are a ton of awkward time jumps thrown in to speed things up. This does allow for some deep discussions about virtual life versus real life though. Like the characters begin to forget their 'real' lives because they've been in this 'fake' one for so long. But yeah, half-way through the series, the original premise has basically concluded and a new one is thrown in. Sword Art Online never allows anything to stagnate (which I'd say is good). Because I actually liked the second story arc way more than the first, EVEN WHEN it's more cliche than the first one (I don't know how they do it). Perhaps it's not surprising when I say it revolves around Kirito and Asuna's relationship. It embellishes their relationship more than I would've thought possible, so you want them to be together so desperately. Kirito also develops another relationship that comes out of nowhere, but is still very good as well.
Overall, everything just accumulates into something that is so enjoyable. Don't let the SERIOUS FLAWS it possesses get in the way. There's so much to enjoy here that those flaws are hardly noteworthy in comparison. It's no complex masterpiece, just straight forward fun and warm emotions.",10

                If we make it back to the real world, I'll find you. And fall in love with you all over again.
After reading all these negative reviews about Sword Art Online, i decided to make my own review about one of my favorite anime.
This is one of those few animes where after finishing an episode, you want to watch the next one right away! 
But what makes this anime different from all the others?
Well, gaming, love, relationships, the will to fight for one and the other? The way you can feel the sorrow and the happiness like they do. 
Alright time for some description of the
                  plot. (WARNING) Might be spoil
Story: 7
This teenage kid with 10.000 others gets trapped in a gaming universe, its not possible to log out unless they clear the game. If it should happen that they die in the game, the same will happen in real life. There is 100 floors they have to clear before they can win the game.
Alright this sounds very promising, there is a story for what i think could be one of the best animes. However instead of a sort of long anime, they chose to make a big time skip, which i think is sad because they had the plot for what could be something way better.
The romance part: If you want to watch this anime, do NOT expect only action and fighting, because the romance is probably the biggest subject in this anime. Personally i like animes with romance, and this is not an exception. The relationship between the 2 main characters (Kirito and Asuna) is special and unique. Its a sort of anime where you just wish for their happiness, which sometimes just seems impossible for them to get. 
The story gets 7 (good) because its a brilliant idea to an anime, but just sad that they didn't complete it like the way i wanted it to :).
Art: 8
The art is good, beautiful design, characters where you really can feel well, yeah their feelings :p. It looks nice, beautiful landscape and well, nothing really bad about it. 
Sound: 8
Great music in the right timing, the voices fitted perfectly to the characters. well realistic sword sounds?. Not really much to say about the sound. To be honest is was not the thing i focused on the most :)
Characters: 8
The characters in SAO is typically gaming characters. A person running a shop, solo player, team player, guild master, game master, blacksmith etc. These individual characters had nice personalities but nothing outstanding and not bad either. However there was these few characters you really noticed. Asuna and Kirito of course, which both of them was the best characters, you see how they develop throw the series, they get stronger physically and emotionally.
The villains is also well done characters, that really provoke your feelings, and the way you can see how they are mentally degraded.
To make this short.
2 main characters:10
villains: 8
Rest of the casting and characters: 6
Enjoyment: 10
This is one of those few animes i really whole hearted enjoyed. It got some great points of views. I would even say it got some piece of life in it, it makes me think about the life afterwards, it proved how much a person in love really want to fight just to be with each other. A wonderful romance anime with twists, fighting, love and friendship. 
Overall: 8
I enjoyed watching this anime, which i hope you will to. I can surely recommend  this anime. Just remember you are not watching a shounen anime, you are watching a romance anime with action in it. Watch SAO and judge for yourself whether you liked it or not. 
This is my first review so please feel free to write to me if i am doing something wrong, or anything i could do better. 
And also feel free to ask any question needed :)",8

                 Sword art online, by Kawahara Kojima is honestly one of the worst, if not the worst anime, actually, fucking thing I have ever seen in my goddamn life. First of all, the story makes no cohesive sense, this shit stinks! Why are the plotholes not plugged up like a man's butthole when he has haemorrhoids? These plotholes are especially jarring when I am trying to immerse myself into the Blackswordsman, Kirito himself. I want to be able to relate to such a well written character. I WANT to be able to know how it feels like to be so cool, popular, get bitches and
                  money. I WANT to like the show with such well written characters scattered throughout. But these plotholes are simply too distracting for me to be able to enjoy the film properly. Other than the plotholes, I want to complain about the characters! They are so poorly made and written, that it just feels like I'm watching a puppet show, but no personality. This is really distracting to the great overall plotline of SAO. 
 First of all, Asuna, more like A-soon-as-I-finish-this-show-I-will-drink-bleach, is such a badly written character. Her sole purpose is to gargle God Kirito's sperm, filled with rich nutrients btw, and just show her boobies on screen. How did Kojima even create such a whorey character? It just feels like Kojima is just reflecting his perverted fantasy onto the great world of SAO, ruining it for everyone else. Other than her character being unbelievably bland, the director chose to make her say little to no words at all? Wasting the godly talent of Haruka Tomatsu on this cardboard, cookie cutter bitch! The ONLY redeeming quality about Asuna in this show is that her character design is remotely attractive, her face is impressively animated, as expected of A-1 pictures, and her figure is quite well distributed. But again, this is just the result of Kojima's sick, perverted fantasy luring in the male viewers, which I myself am unfortunately.
 Suguha, or as I'd like to call her, Sug-on-my-dick-gu-ha, is honestly even worse than Asuna in every aspect except booby size. I for one, am a connoisseur of big, plumpy breasts, but even my boner could not ignore the jarring problem with Suguha's character. She is too thirsty for Kirito's phallus, despite them being blood-related! What. A. Whore. This is also another one of Kojima's sister complex, being reflected onto viewers, brainwashing them to see their sisters more than just sisters. Much like Asuna however, Suguha does have a redeeming quality. This being her breast size. While I have mentioned before that she is just fanservice bait, Suguha's breasts are simply too beautifully animated to not look at. A-1 pictures really outdone themselves this time. But again, we must not ignore Kojima's perverted fantasies and allow ourselves to indulge in it. 
 The last, but not least, is Kirito-god-sama himself. Firstly, I'd like to say, I love kirito's simple but extremely effective design. It is innovative, but at the same time, does not stand out like a stupid Yu-gi-oh main character. This is the only good thing that has come out of Kojima's perverted mind. I have personally never seen an anima character who looks like Kirito ever. His design is extremely unique, but at the same time, simple enough for viewers to immerse themselves into him. This is further supported by his personality, being as dense and bland as the ocean and stick, the viewers can completely imagine themselves being in Kirito's shoes. As most viewers are sweaty neckbeards, or fat gamer nerds, it is not hard for them to WANT to immerse themselves into such a cool character. Kojima really knows his target audience. I for one, love Kirito's character and everything about him, I love the simple, seemingly uninspired design, his bland personality which allows for easy immersion, and the way the show portrays him as extremely attractive as all these girls hop on his dick. This definitely makes me feel like I can be the same, and I am sure it is the same for others. It is a shame that such a well written, well designed character is stuck in such a boring world of SAO. Anyone who says that Kirito is a bad character should be euthanized, and just cannot appreciate well-written characters. Simply babies who just exited the womb, no taste. 
 Ultimately, I would like to end this review on a positive note.But before that, I would like to thank today's sponsors. With today's sponsors, NordVPN, Raid:Shadowlegends, and ExpressVPN, you can watch SAO in all countries and regions possible! Back to the review, essentially SAO is a garbage dumpster fire of a show, its only redeeming qualities being Kirito's well designed and written character, nothing else in the show make sense, the girls are specifically designed to bait in 12 year old adolescents with constant hormonal shifts, who sees boobies and drools. SAO is basically a well written character stuck in a shitty show. Here is some advice Kojima, to make a good show, just add Kirito, bring Suguha's breasts, and bring Asuna but better written.",1
"
                Sword Art Online is one anime which speaks about every individuals life through the main character Kirito. Kirito is a programming  genius also a hardcore gamer.He has a great academic score but he is tied of living life.When he hears about a virtual reality game in which a player's mind literally becomes part of the game he is thrilled and see this as a great opportunity to  live in a world of adventure.
When every player who has the game login the game they are told that they cannot log out of the game until the game is completely beat.Thus begins the  adventure
                  of this anime.The cliche is that if a player dies in the virtual game then that player will die in reality.
Story-8/10
The story focuses on the struggles of Kirito in the Virtual World .Kirito enters the game as a very shy and lonely person but as the game progress his personality changes completely.He starts becoming more open to people.Must players are playing the game simply to finish the game and reach the real World but months  pass people start realizing the virtual world isn't that bad.people live life completely free from stress and live there dream.(THIS IS NOT A SPOILER) eg There is a stdio director who is stuck in the game but he lives his life in peace as a fisher man in the virtual world(That's is his dream job).Kirito on the other hand is playing the game to simply Neat the game.
Sound-8/10
The music of the show was best suited for the show.My personal favorites were the second opening and ending theme songs.
Animation-10/10
Now you are probably wonder why am I giving this show's animation 10/10.
Well the show was made in 2012 .This show's animation was  mind blowing for that time(in fact it had the best animation that year without any doubt ).This show really did very well in the market so it encouraged animating companies to start animation with high budget using the 3-D touch.So Basically every anime which you are seeing from 2013 on wards who's animation you find is mind blowing is thanks to Sword Art Online.
Enjoyment-8.5/10
I really enjoyed the show.
Overall-8.7/10
Why did people not enjoy the show?(If anyone has watched it and has told you that the show is a waste of time)
 Well Some people were watching the show only For the purpose of action while the show was about Kirito who represents every individual's will to fight and his changing life.
Villain-10/10
The second Half of the show showed fitly and corrupted villain who showed true nature of evil in Humanity.This impressed me quite a lot although I hated that guy,But the way True power was reflected through him was very impressive.(I also hated this guy's acts )
Well This was my Opinion about the show.
Thank you for Reading.",9

                WARNING!! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!
I'm very sorry about this, but I just felt like I couldn't write a decent review without including some spoilers.
So, let’s get straight to it. Starting off with the story element.
	The story of SAO is one that I believe I have seen too many times before. The element of being trapped in a game is about as commonplace as the ‘Battle-Royale type’ genre, if you could call it that. Nevertheless, the story is somehow able to remain fresh, full of interesting plot points and ‘twists’ (well, not exactly, but I don’t know what to call them). In general, it was an
                  interesting plot. 
Unfortunately for the anime, there are numerous points which manage to bring it down. 
	Firstly, there are numerous time jumps. While portraying a whole two years of game may be a little long and unneeded, just skipping them from one episode to the next draws away from the story line, hinders character development, and left me confused many times, to say the least. The worst part is that time jumps continue to happen throughout the anime. Like, seriously, read the dates shown on the screen or die.
	There are numerous (small) inconsistencies in the anime as well, not only related to the time jumps, such as Kirito’s sudden changes between solo and working with a guild (especially near the start). And at the end, when he suddenly gets to use ‘ID Heathcliff’. Completely out of the blue. Or when Suguha (Leafa) doesn’t know that her brother’s alias in SAO was ‘Kirito’. Like, EVERYONE knows that!!! Nothing too bad, but not good either.
	Another thing which seriously bugged me was that (and here is the spoiler) in an anime called ‘Sword Art Online’, only half of the actual anime is happening in Sword Art Online! Honestly! Not that I have any problem with ALFheim (or whatever) Online, I actually like the concept more than Sword Art Online, but why call the anime ‘Sword Art Online’?! It seems relatively unfitting. 
Random Kirito quote:
	“I’ll bet on my virginity-“
Wow, Kirito. What a deep and meaningful start to a sentence you have there.
	To conclude with this story element, the romance, in particular between Asuna and Kirito. I feel like this really brought the show down by a lot. While it is seemingly realistic and has the good element of a mutual feeling of love, it is soooooo soppy. As far as I am concerned, Kirito meets Asuna, forms a party, then leaves to be a solo player as he usually is. Two years later, he’s working a little with the Knights of the Blood Oath, and on polite terms with Asuna. Then, less than a month later (or so it would seem, the time jumps probably made it longer), they’re talking about marriage, subtly *cough cough* (not really) implying to each other that they want to get married, then kissing before getting physical and actually marrying each other. (Me: Come ON guys! You’re like sixteen!) 
	Oh well, I guess Kirito can’t bet on his virginity anymore. Too bad…
	And then there are those scenes where I’m banging my head on the table because of the “If you don’t come back I’ll kill myself” dialogue. So cheesy.
(Extra note: Did anyone notice that at the end when Kirito’s trying to kill Sugou and pictures of Asuna as well as what the guy did to her flash through his mind - the last picture, which really sets Kirito/Kazuto off, is that of Asuna smiling the morning after they made out?!)
I have mixed feelings about the second part of SAO, ALFheim online. On one hand, I really like the concept of it and I liked that it continued the show (since I didn’t really want it to finish), on the other hand, it is a little out of place in an anime called Sword Art Online (as I mentioned earlier). It is also so similar to SAO. Now, whether this is good or bad is debatable. On one hand, it is good because they are both within the same show, so something completely different would be even more out of place. On the other hand, it is too similar in the sense that the concepts are pretty much exactly the same, there is the same kind of ‘villain’ who is controlling the game, etc. It’s like two virtual reality games which are exactly the same. Not much for originality. It did have a few good points like promoting character development and such. Meh.
	Art… Hmmm… It wasn’t the best but I actually liked it a fair bit. Not my favourite, though. Scenery was very nice, characters were decent… Nothing amazing but very good nonetheless.
	Music was pretty, and I would like to say abundant, since it is often playing, but the battle theme is always the same. Not that I have anything against the battle theme - it actually sent pleasant tingling sensations up my back - but I do wish they would have had more music. Way more. There was such good potential. Eh, in all, it was good. I guess. 
	On to characters. Looking back now, I realise that the character development is actually quite decent. Even characters who don’t get much time on screen get an acceptable amount of development. However, despite this, I haven’t actually developed a favourite character, which is a rarity and a very negative point. Special mention goes to Yui, though. She made me squeal repeatedly and wish I could hug her.
	I really, REALLY hate Kirito, though. Firstly, just after the group has defeated the first boss and he is called a ‘beater’, he suddenly becomes all cold and somewhat villian-like. But I’m willing to let it slide. 
	Kirito is such a stereotypical hero, and that’s what I hated about him. Of course he defeats both games, I mean it would be stupid to let someone else do so, right? (sarcasm). He attracts girls like moths to a bulb, and although you could say he stays loyal to Asuna, it’s still very annoying.
	The other characters were good, I actually quite liked Kayaba Akihiko in the end, despite the fact that he was technically the antagonist. The first antagonist, at least.
	However, there are frequent personality changes which seem out of place. Yes, different situations stimulate different emotions, but these changes… No. Just no. 
And… 
That’s all I can say.
Overall, this was a good anime. While the story itself wasn’t the most original, it was still very pleasing. The character development was good, but the hero was sickeningly stereotypical. Some inconsistencies here and there. Despite my somewhat poisonous review, I actually enjoyed this anime immensely and hated sleeping because it was a time where I could not keep watching.
Story: 6.5/10 (would give 7.5 but romance and inconsistencies brought it down by 1 point)
Art: 8/10 
Sound: 7/10 
Character: 6/10 
Enjoyment: 8.5/10
Overall: 7.2/10 (rounded to 7)
A/N: I apologize for all the parentheses and decimals. I think this was the hardest anime to rate yet. XD It was also probably the most 'personal' in the sense that I was making a live commentary whilst watching it and felt it would be interesting to include at least some of it into my review. Again, please comment, comments are loved and appreciated!!",7

                Now reviewing the first season of Sword Art Online (SAO for short).
SAO had a real impact on the anime community back in 2012, managing to create true factions between people: some praise it and believe it's the best anime ever been and ever to be, some others believe it's the spawn of satan himself and ruined anime forever. 
Me? I have the luxury to stand in between these two groups, and the prospective is hopefully allowing me to have a tiny bit more objective view on the show. So now let's dive into the actual review.
Let's start with what i liked about SAO.
The show is
                  majestic in terms of art and ANIMATION, the characters move fluidly on the screen and display true emotion through facial expressions, the bright colors of the cartoony virtual world never cease to amaze me, and the effects are dealt with in a marvelous way too. The SOUNDTRACK is well thought out and fits the scenes at all times. These two awesome qualities of the anime are even better noticed in the action scenes, the epic boss battles that made fanboys and fangirls all around the world cry and shake hysterically. We are talking about a piece of fiction that should always be emulated and taken in consideration when it comes to any aspect of animation and sound.
Now let's talk about what i did not like of SAO.
I am a big videogame fan, i play games all the time and have quite a culture on the game industry, i thought i was gonna love this show no matter what. Unfortunately this was not the case. The overall PLOT starts off very well, but then never fully delivers, it just gets lost episode after episode, and the great premise of the beginning feels like a betrayal the more you go on into what seems like bad quality fanfiction. Of course i cannot dive in the plot too much without entering the spoiler realm, but let's just say that the first half of the season was average but still enjoyable, while the second half is just mayhem and plotholes and... tentacle hentai.
The CHARACTERS, unfortunately, fall flat as well. In the best case scenario you will tolerate them. Me? I found myself despising most of the cast. A main character that is so unlikable it is hard to believe who still manages to create himself his own harem of beautiful (and borderline braindead) young female. Sigh. And don't even get me started on the main villains of the series!
So, time to state my FINAL JUDGEMENT: 
SAO is a very naive series, it will be a very good time if you are new to the medium, if you are very young and/or if you just want something to watch with your brain off. I would never recommend this to anyone looking for something mature such as a real story with real characters.

                I don't know where to even start with this. Everything is perfect. Kirito is a badass character that makes me wish was an actual guy I could meet and lose to in a fight since I can't even hold a sword. The awesome thing about this anime is that it's for both girls and guys, so you can watch it alone or with anyone. It has action, comedy and some romance for the girls (and guys) who like that sort of thing (like me!). What I also love about this anime is that there's isn't just one plot but (up until Season 2) it has
                  4. There's a new story for every 15 episodes or so that really makes it enjoyable since it's not just the same ol' plot throughout the entire series. New characters are introduced that make the anime really great. Instead of damsels in distress, this anime shows how badass girls can be by using a sword or gun and fighting ruthlessly. Having its setting be post apocalyptic is also really awesome since I saw things that don't exist today and wished that it exited now. It's so beautiful and, being a screamer, I can't help but scream during each episode from excitement. It's a must watch/ read!",10

                SAO is my personal favorite anime of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline of both the Aincrad arc and Fairy Dance arc. The animation quality was phenomenal and the voice acting for both sub and dubs were great. SAO was my favorite romance for quite some time until I watched another series, but that will be for another discussion. I binged watched the series over a weekend I got sick and fell in love with immediately and when I heard about the 2nd season last year, I was so excited. SAO will continue to be favorite anime. I enjoyed the ending of the Fairy
                  Dance arc mainly due to the romantic moment involved. However, I would say that the Aincrad arc was the better of the 2, but both are still enjoyable.",10
"
                I understand that my scores might seem weird. And I will explain. I feel that this anime had SO much potential. An incredible amount of potential. However I see it very much so the way that I see Deadman Wonderland.
This anime by no means lacks popularity. And my hatred for it does NOT come from its popularity. HOWEVER it does come from the way they messed it up big time.
Much like dead man, I thought the plot was absolutely amazing, riveting, and tbh I was very interested to see how they took it. Things began to take a south turn when I realized every single
                  episode was following a time skip. It completely and utterly ruined any potential character development for me. Not only that but pushing itself into another area (said it like that to avoid those who might watch it from having it ruined) destroyed any feelings I had left for the Anime. They should've ended it WAY earlier then they did. It just got more and more pointless for me as time went on.
Perhaps my negative feelings for it come from my expectations and hype for this anime being so greatly disappointed. Perhaps its not really THAT bad. However for me, they had a diamond in the rough with this anime, and they just completely ignored its potential.",3
"
                Well First Off I'll start with the fact that, I knew NOTHING before getting into the series about the SAO novels and what-not. I personally started watching it seeing all the hype based on the MASSIVE amount of wallpapers/fan-art and discussions that  I've been seeing around the net.
As of writing this review I believe SAO (Sword Art Online) has been one of the most hyped Anime of the year, (Atleast the second Half of the year.)And I'll give u  the bare truth of it all. ---> Does It Live upto the Hype??? ->Answer:- Not even Closely. :|
The story revolves around people getting trapped
                  Inside a Virtual reality Online MMO. A wonderful concept, though I believe not exactly a new one. Still, that is a somewhat thought provoking concept.
When i started watching the series, by the time I reached episode 3, I was more or less Bored.. YET not bored enough that I  completely stopped watching the series. 
By about Episode >5 I realised that the story was gonna gonna be extremely cliche and that the story wouldn't have much value. Still I strived on.
The Good News is that, this wasn't a bad decision (IMHO), as when it reached episode 15 and above the story became much better. Uptil this point the character development was at its best -Shallow. but then nearly every parts of the story became better. Though the art Palette change was a bit disappointing. 
So now lets start with the rating. (Rating out of 5)
Story:            **.* (2.5 stars)
- Horrible at first. Completely Shallow Character Development. Though the concept is pretty nice. Note that for those who have no clue  of  what an MMO  is, may find the topic also pretty bad and will be confused about a heck load of stuff, that is mentioned or assumed obvious. But one the + side the story does pick up. (and I'm personally Hoping that the story line continues to improve). Fillers are there, but  not too annoying , so i give that a pass.
Art:- ****.*   (4.5 stars)
Highly Beautiful art. Superb Palette choice. 4.5 Only because somehow I'm allergic  to giving a full 5 rating, and also because I was a bit disappointed about the light change in Phase 2 of the anime... The generic  Castles in the air in every MMO has been depicted very beautifully, and the general feel of the anime is very nice.
Sound:- **** (4  stars)
Sound works has been really nice. Songs are amazingly good, and the BG sounds are well timed and adds some well needed depth to the story, and Haven't been a nuicanse even once.
Character:- *.* (1.5 stars)
Dreadful character development at the start of the anime. Thankfully it improves  a  hell lot (NOTE:- Comparatively) once u hit around episode 15 or so. Still, not particularly awesome as of writing this. (+ the start drags the points down quite a bit).
Enjoyment:-  ***.* (3.5 stars)
Even though i did say the story was kinda bad and the  the  Character development was Pathetic, still I guess the story was good enough that, not only did i watch the entire thing (as of what has been released), But now  I got a new thing to add for every Saturday/Sunday.... A  guilt pleasure I suppose, but the improvement in story does help.. Though i have a feeling the amazing art is what pulls me to this.
Overall:- *** (3 stars)
The Beautiful art and the fact that I enjoyed it (I'm not really sure how and y i enjoyed it, I just did). Gives this Anime a rating of Fair/Good.The story as of now has been completely cliche /predictable. but it is still a beautiful fantasy ride. So  watching it isn't a complete waste of time.
NOTE :- There are Oodles of Fan-service. For those who like it ->Have fun.
For  those who hate it -> ITS THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! >:|",6

                here's my SAO review :
plot/story 2/10 who the fuck plays an MMO only to be alone also why no classes. ALO is dumb 9 way faction pvp where each faction is different enough to be an actual class. if it were a real game it wold be complete shit just like SAO
characters development: 2/10 what development?
ART and animation: 8/10 Look good only redeeming quality outside of soundtrack
soundtrack: 7/10 pretty good
if You must watch this trash I suggest scrubbing through to the fan service scenes and ignoring the rest although if that was your entent go watch some hentai or a good ecchi anime and not
                  waste your time with this garbage.
overall score: 4/10
How is SAO bad as a game well:
alright lets make a fantasy MMO where where everyone is the same class and no roles other than damage because fuck healers, tanks, and support roles. lets also throw in mechanics like poisons or bosses that need to be dodged, parried, blocked, or in pretty much all cases tanked. then lets have it so that once you die you can't play it anymore because you are dead.
sounds like a good game right? haha no.
alright what about the second part?
Alright how about this then.
an MMO with 9 races each race is its own faction and all factions are at war with eachother.
Faction A= Fire magic + 2 handed weapon damage dealers 
Faction B= support/healers only with Air magic
Faction C= support/healers only with water magic
Faction D= stealth / rogue classes
Faction E= Earth magic + tanks
Faction F= Animals
Faction G = Black magic
Faction H= Bards
Faction I= Blacksmiths and every other crafting profession
RIP anyone who isn't in faction A, D, E, and possibly F and G. you're gonna get ganked.
this is ALO from SAO in a nutshell
the author of SAO has never played an MMO in his life and doesn't understand things like balance and game design.",4
"
                It's one of the worst anime I've seen so far. Let me explain, it's based in a MMO which are made for multiplayer and the main character  goes solo becoming one of the highest level players without a group and is able to beat anyone he needs to, why? Because he's the main character that's why! The same goes for why he's able to duel willed and no one else. And no! It just popping in his skill list out of nowhere is not a good reason at all! Then the characters they are so generic and most of them are useless to the
                  overall storyline. Speaking of the the story it was jumping all over just skipping so much time. The main plot device, the VR headset makes no sense at all! Where the people in the real world can just unplug the computer which would turn off the game and lower the power of the headset sooner or later. So how are they still in the game at the hospital. This has no LOGIC. Plus why would that headset be allowed out in stores if it can easily kill you. This is not fantasy It’s in the near future. This would never come to pass. The worst of the whole anime the main bad guy can’t even remember way he did what he did. If that’s not bad writing, I don’t know what is!!!",3
"
                First off, I am not going to rate this show for the entire season 1. Instead this review will be only about the SAO arc which I would like to think of as the real season 1 and that Alfheim was season 1 bonus episodes or maybe even OVAs. 
Season 1 of SAO was great. Since I am a pretty pro gamer (meaning in the games I play my KD ratio is very high and my ELO is always in the 2000s and I BETA test like Kirito and I play in tournaments),  I can empathize with Kirito a lot and even started to
                  make references to Kirito about myself. The story and the concepts kept me interested throughout. The show managed to catch my attention from the very first episode and the use of video archetypes kept me constantly amused. With a good mix of action and romance, the show quickly moved up in my list of top anime. 
The characters, I felt, was lovable too. As I have said, I can emphasize with Kirito and want to actually be someone like Kirito. He is awesome. Asuna is lovable too. She would make a perfect wife for a gamer being beautiful, kind, hard working, gamer, a good cook, and did I mention she can make really good sandwiches? The part with Yui is so cute. They would make a beautiful family. 
I loved the ending also. I felt like I got still got the kick from an ending where the main character dies like in Elfen Lied but just when I started to wish it was a happy ending It was all good again. I thought they ended it beautifully with Kazuto searching for Asuna in the end.
Im not gonna bother reviewing the bonus episodes because then this show wouldn't deserve a 10 and I want to give the show a 10 so badly. Bonus episodes I'll rate it as maybe a 7 or an 8.",10
"
                As an unqualified and no way smart viewer, this review should be taken with a grain of salt. SAO was the first Anime i watched after taking a hiatus from anime. I Started watching anime again because of this anime. The first Arc (1-13), while rushed, was great and i watch it over and over again from time to time. I really feel invested, in a sense, in the Ship and really do enjoy watching the First Arc. The first time i watched it, i actually cried near the end (no spoilers), which again at the time, was my first anime in about 3 years,
                  so give me a free pass :3. Of course it isn't that sophisticated and missed the opportunity to delve deeper into the more complicated themes and ideas, it wasn't really what i felt the point of the anime, as i own the graphics novels and can somewhat understand why the whole anime was rushed. That said the 2nd arc was not very enjoyable and some might say it was cancer. I felt that the concept of the 2nd Arc was good, but shouldn't have brought another character into the plot, especially when said character gets shipped with Kirito (yes i feel strongly for the axk ship and will defend it to my last breath). 
Some might say this is a harem anime but i personally think it isn't but that is my view.
Overall, this anime will always hold a place in my heart, as it brought me into the world of anime again, even if that world does have it's own problems.",9
"
                1. To be honest, the author isn't a good writer. SAO is supposed to be an action/adventure anime. But it turned out to be romance/harem/drama. And the romance isn't even good, it's forced and rushed. Why? Let's see. Asuna met Kirito, and love at first sight. The same can be said to every other girl he met. Few episodes later, they got married (not even legal age yet), had sex (I believe) and adopted a kid. There is no development between the two, making it forced and rushed.
2. Characters also have little to no development. Seriously, if your name isn't ""Kirito"", you don't get to
                  improve as a character. They had no changes in personality and skill.
3. Gary Stu #2. I don't even need to explain this.
4. ""Why did you do this?"" ""I forgot."" BRAVO. BEST VILLAIN EVER. EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED.
5. Plot. The plot is supposed to be about getting stuck in a video game and escaping. But halfway through, ""let's get married, have sex and a kid, and forget everything in life. Oh wait, I changed my mind. Let's get married, have sex, and have a kid in real life instead."" Then they escaped, girl gets kidnapped, unnecessary tentacle rape scenes, ends.
6. Episode one they're stuck in the game, episode two they're level 43, a few episodes later they defeated tons of bosses. What.
7. SAO should be about swords but no research has been done on how swords are used. For great sword mechanics I would recommend Blades of darkness and Warrior Within.
8. No shields, helmets, pole arms, strategy. The game is just if you have high enough levels you are a god if not you die. There is no room for true skills.
9. In a properly designed game, regen should not be instant. You should at least be out of combat a few seconds.
10. The way they hack the game is bullshit
* Also as a side note in real life unless you get hit in the head or heart you do not die instantly. Depending on your stamina you can do a lot of damage until you collapse.
11. Characters mostly do not react as humans would. Except for the laughing coffin and a few people including Kirito, they act more like NPC's. So it would make sense most people being AI and almost no one actually dying. But hey missed opportunity.
12. Kirito is a psycopath.
13. The combats with the creator of the game make no sense.
14. Aincrad arc has so many plot holes.",2

                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story: 10 - I haven't seen a anime with this much story that transition so smoothly in a while now. 
Art: 10 - The world this anime is built around is just beautiful.
Sound: 10 - Quality sound effects and background music is good.
Character: 8 - Focal point on mostly 2-3 main characters and the support characters fell out early on. But the development on those 2-3 characters were big that filled up for some of the lost points.
Enjoyment: 10 - Loved it every episode especially since I play MMOs in the past and now.  
Overall: 9.6 (10) - One of the best well constructed
                  anime series I have seen in a while and hopefully we will see a season 2 of this anime. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The future of gaming is a mystery you sometimes wonder. Sword Art Online brings to light some of these pondering questions. 
Sword Art Online is a well crafted series on gaming MMO that brings virtual reality MMO to life. I mean, I haven't seen this kind of Anime series since .Hack. Sword Art Online has done an amazing job on displaying what virtual reality MMO is and the psychological draw backs it has. 
But the anime fell back on the character design which disappointed me a little bit because the door of infinite possibility was open. Lets put it this way, introducing a couple of new characters is great. But giving them no development at all has defeat the purpose of introducing them at all. Sticking to 3-4 main to semi main characters was a let down.
Overall Sword Art Online excelled at the setting they aimed for and of course the art on the landscape makes you want to actually play the game, regardless if its a life to death situation. Beautifully well executed anime and I do hope there will be a season 2 for all the fans that are hooked to it.",10
"
                ok children, imma tell you a little story about the wonderful world of SAO.......... I present to you FAN SERVICE AT ITS FINEST. and when I say that I mean it. I personally don't get enjoyment out of seeing oversized animated boobs, but apparently the men in charge of the art wanted it so what ever..... 
SAO is the story of how a psychopathic nerd developed the ultimate gaming system and proceded to enslave the players to play the game. A hero arises (shocker) and this boy (SHOCKER) grows to be one of the highest ranking people in the game (SHOCKER). along the way, EVERY
                  FREAKING GIRL WITH BOOBS THE SIZE OF CANTALOPES falls for our heroic Kirito (main character dude). and when I say every girl, I mean 90% of the entire supporting cast. 
I will stop bashing for a moment to say that I enjoyed the story line. once you remove the boobs and the entire women population from the show, you see a kind kid who levels up to protect the people he cares for, even if it means dying.
Returning to bashing, I felt that the anime was degrading to women. no im not trying to feminism (feminize? idk just roll with me here)  this but I mean every girl was desperate for kirito and are show as weak individuals who need a man by their side to accomplish things. yes Asuna was at the beginning a great female roll model, but later we see her strip down because she thought that Kirito wanted to do it up with her. I mean come on! you cant make a strong female lead then strip her down for the . I was embarrassed to watch that scene as a girl! I was willing to try and look over that detail but then you get to season 2 (or is it in season 1 I get confused ) with the fairy people and at the end of that story Asuna needs to be saved by the dashing and heroic gothic fairy dude that is KIRIKTO THE SAVIOR to the rescue. and at the end of that the evil dude STRIPS HER DORN AGAIN OMG JUST STOP her boobs are showing and it made everyone sad and uncomfortable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
I was slightly appeased when during Gun Gale Online Kirito is portrayed as looking like a girl. revenge for all those weird times yesh............
I will try to give you my honest opinion about this show: I watch this show only when im bored and my other shows aren't premiering new episodes or content. I call it my ""filler"" anime. kind of like filler episodes (you know the ones that mean nothing to the story line but are not as bad as recap episodes). the story line has a new spin on an old concept. in my personal opinion there is a great parody of SAO on YouTube that I found more appealing than the anime its self. (its so funny) that's my opinion! its not a terrible anime, so I wont blame you for liking it!",7
"
                oKAAAAAY 
When this anime came out, my sister and I wanted to join the hype train and say we had seen Sword Art Online. And since it was on Netflix, AND in English eventually, we were like ""SIGN ME THE HECK UP!"" 
We watched 6 episodes of this anime and said ""EH. We'll come back to it in a few days."" 
Never went back. Shows you how great and compelling the story was right? 
Kirito bored the hell out of me, as did pretty much every other character you meet episodes 1-6. 
Asuna I enjoyed because she was pretty badass. But from what I understand
                  she just ends up becoming a pretty sidepiece for Kirito and that's not ok. 
Anyways, this anime I know has a huuuuuge cult following but I don't think it's worth my time. If you like it, great, fine. But it isn't my thing at all",3
"
                And so comes the epic conclusion to the anime 'Sword Art Online'! Before I begin I'd like to say its been an adventure all season getting to see the world of SAO with my very eyes! I have enjoyed the beautiful art that I have seen and am beyond glad the world I dream about was brought to life. Thanks to A1 Studios, we were able to follow the tale of the Black Swordsman Kirito with our eyes and ears. With splendid visuals and an excellent music score, this world became a breath-taking experience. This anime covers the story of a MMORPG fan who takes
                  on the worlds first Virtual Reality MMO. In this future the latest video game console is one that you put on your head. Its called Nerve Gear and as the name suggests, by intercepting signals from the brain it throws you fully into a virtual world where you can experience all 5 senses. With the release of the first full VR MMO game, a lucky 10 thousand people got to buy the game on its launch. Sword Art Online is a fantasy world beyond imagine with a large focus on melee weapons (so no magic). In this world players must work together to defeat each boss to advance to the next floor. Aincrad (the floating castle in the sky in which SAO takes place in) has 100 floors, each harder than the last. However panic ensues when players find out there is no logout button. They find out that they are never able to leave because if they do, the nerve gear will fry their brains. On top of that, if you die in the game, you die for real. Now stuck in a battle for not only his life but the lives of 10 thousand other players, Kirito must use everything he knows about MMOs to beat this deathmatch. Its a story of love, friendship, desperation, and overcoming the laws of the virtual world! Now that you know a bit about the good stuff and story, I shall get on with what I didn't like. This anime was an adaptation of a light novel by the same name. Novels 1-4 plus a bunch of side stories were adapted into this season. That was ALOT of story. While I believe A1 did a great job compacting the story and telling the basic story well, I believe this was not as good as it could have been. This anime was over hyped before it began due to the highly successful LN. The reason I feel the LN worked so well was because it took that time to get you invested in all the characters and events. Nearly every episode felt rushed and left out so many things that added to the story. Now don't get me wrong, they weren't necessary details but it made the difference between good and amazing. The fight scenes seemed very quick and to the point due to this and there was very little build up at all. One could also argue that they managed to butcher most of the side stories because of how little time they had. I would have rather seen only the Aincrad story arc and related side stories take up the 25 episodes. Then less cramming would need to be done and the focus would be on the story and fights instead of summarizing everything. Another problem I had was that, at times, the animation quality would drop quite a bit. You could clearly notice a ton of detail missing during certain scenes. Lazy animators possibly? I'll never know. Though I believe the LN to be greatly superior to this anime, I believe everyone should give both a shot as they are wonderful works of art! Personally I think the 1st and last episodes followed the LN very well and gave off that same amazing feeling, so not all was lost. I honestly can't wait for a second season. SAO is not the best anime ever made but it certainly a worthwhile experience that everyone should try.",7
"
                The 1st half about SAO was great. I like it soo much. But I did have a problem with all the time skips cause I didn't bother paying too much attention to the dates shown and it gets confusing. It had so much potential with that given plot and I feel kinda sad it's been watered down so much. Still gave a good rating cause being inside a game and actually living a life in it was one of my childhood dreams and it made me really happy just to be able too see it happen even if it's only on a computer screen. I
                  would definitely have given a lower rating if this was not my dream. I also see a lot of people hating especially on the 2nd half about ALO. I'm actually a bit glad it was bad in the since I always feed sad when a good anime or one that I enjoy ends. If it ended at the end of SAO I would be very sad. But the fact that it went on to something worse took that feeling away. Now I just felt something meh just ended.",8
"
                I began to see Sword art online (SAO) mainly due to the great difference of opinion between her supporters and detractors. How can a series be so loved and hated at the same time ?. I think that the answer lies in what you expect to have Sao. I mean, if you are a person that you like video games and also the ""romance"" (this is very important, because in sao love is floating in the air, hehe), then you'll love Sao.
But if you are from people who expect a game like Sao anime have stock, a good development of the history, evolution of characters,
                  memorable battles and epic deaths, then Sao will disappoint.
Having said that I must say that I was disappointed and Sao tremendously, because when I started to see it had great expectations of this anime thanks to its appealing main argument (death in the game = death in real life). And if I ended up seeing it full, it was because I wanted to see destroyed what could have been a great anime.
Here's why Sword Art Online anime is bad for me.
ANIMATION AND MUSIC
Perhaps the only decent Sao, a correct animation containing both Aincrad beautiful landscapes and Alfheim. The animation was well achieved fights generally nothing to reproach in this criterion. The opening and ending acceptable, although there was no particular topic memorable.
HISTORY
In this part the trouble getting a story that was initially appear attractive is decaying in each chapter progresses. You cut many important parts of the story (SPOILER as fights with bosses floor 4 of 100), Putting chapters that have nothing to do with the main plot, chapters were a real torture. I think if they wanted to tell the daily lives of the protagonists, they had not done an anime of 24 chapters makes the story as being too short and lose fluidity and sense. The plot development is generally very chaotic, you do not know because they get to fish (instead of leaving the game) and the next chapter are in a fight to death with a floor manager (trying to get out as quickly as possible game). Oh my God!
And speaking of Alfheim, it comes down to ""Rescue the princess castle."" If the first arc of Sao was bad the second is worse, not worth watching, because this has all gotten clichés and for an anime. The whole story worked really too bad.
CHARACTERS
This is definitely the worst Sao problem. Kirito-sama (Uncle is the strongest in and out of the game) is positioned as one of the worst characters I've seen in an anime. His poor charisma and personality, coupled with his incredible appeal with all the girls in Sao, make Kirito-sama a little boring to look credible and character. But the part that generated more questions than answers me was, how became so strong ?, in the anime will not explain or tells you. In my view all the anime revolves around Sao Kirito, even enemies depend on it. This is not bad if you know how to give the right touch (Samurai X is one of the best animes I've seen and where the weight of the series is the protagonist, who is one of the best) but if the protagonist does not "" size "", happens what happened to Sao. The other point are the secondary characters (Asuna) that do not add anything new or interesting to anime.
The romance between Kirito and Asuna (although very cloying my taste) is more than 80% of Sao, that is, Sao anime is a game, fight, action and end up showing us an anime where the romance is more important. Please. None of the characters is saved bringing empty clichés and characters galore.
Finally, I want to say that Sao is bad, but not the worst anime I've seen (and I've seen worse), has many, many errors within the structure of the story. The lack of creativity and originality when creating the characters passed the bill to Sao. I have thought to see the second season to see if it improves or worsens. Cheers",2

                Sword Art Online, is an anime based on a newly created MMORPG where all the players on the first day of release realize that their isn't a way to logout and if they die in the game they.... die in real life(oh no)! We can tell right from the start they draw alot of inspiration from the .hack series which is surprising since that series was absolutely garbage. Anyways the players must beat the game to escape, and go back to their normal lives.
Story: 6
The story isn't anything really special it's exactly what you expect the main character just playing the game. They do some
                  things really well like showing features of the MMORPG off, i.e cooking, PvP, boss fights, ect. Also any gamer will slightly orgasm after hearing them talk in the latest gaming lingo. The anime completely rushes through SAO their is a timeskip almost every episode. When they finally escape SAO they jump right into another world named Alfheim Online which is a god awful excuse for an MMORPG. It's just SAO with fairies, magic and a really stupid faction system. All sense of danger is lost since dying no longer really matters and the story just turns into the main character having to save the female lead from being virtually molested and being turned into a sex slave for tentacle monsters, joking.
Art: 10
Great art, fluid animation and awesome fight scenes.
Sound: 9
Killer soundtrack and badass opening theme song, voice actor really well done in Japanese. The dubbed version sucks, stay away from that garbage.
Character: 7
Kirito himself is pretty cool except he takes the second half the show way too serious going complete ape shit every fight. He's just really OP didn't see too much skill in him, unless you call grinding a skill.
Asuna(Female Lead) is introduced as some badass mysterious female gamer, but then just turns into a useless love interest.
No real development was made to any of the characters, unless you count levels.
Enjoyment: 8
You'll never really get bored the action and learning about the concepts/features of SAO will keep you entertained.
Overall: 8
It's a good anime but definitely not the best like the fanboys try to act like it is. Just watch it, you won't regret the time spent.",8
"
                The thought of immersing yourself in a virtual world to escape reality has always fascinated me.  The fact SOA can do this with a twist was what really got my attention to start watching.  At first look it sounds like a hum-drum concept if you're not too into virtual reality and escaping reality, however you need to go into watching this anime without any expectations to appreciate it.  Give it a shot and be your own judge.

                There are lots of terrible anime out there. Anime that doesn't make sense. Anime with stilted animations, uninspiring art style or sound design. Anime so bad that will make you want to claw your eyes out. 
Sword Art online is not one of them. It has a bright, colorful palette and adequate sound design. Voice actings are top notch. (Even my all-time favourite Saori Hayami is involved, though her role is minor) Its animations are fluid for the most part, and despite the completely unoriginal premise, it manages to execute it well.  
It is also the worst anime of all time.
A great deal of
                  its awfulness lies with its protagonist, who goes by the name Kirito. AKA anime Jesus. AKA Leet haxxor. AKA Harem God. You see, Kirito is the type of shameless self-insert born out of terrible writing and a slight detachment from reality on the author's part. Think Bella from Twilight, or Eragon from the Inheritance Cycle. Normally I'm okay with these type of protagonist. I've read through all four Twilight books and didn't hate them, so you know my tolerance for crappy writing is high. I, however, for the love of me cannot stand Kirito. It's the fact that,  at the tender age of 14, Kirito is somehow a master-class hacker (Seriously we're talking Bloody Monday class hacker), able to hack the game system from INSIDE the game. It's the fact that he's somehow managed to solve every problem by himself, in a game DESIGNED for teamwork.  It's the fact that every girl somehow magically falls in love with him for no reason other than him being good at the game. It's also the fact that Kirito can do no wrong, that he can flirt with chicks in front of his girlfriend (in season 2, and that's the season I thought was mostly okay) and suffers no consequences. His behavior can be downright inappropriate at times, but its ok because he's the hero, right? RIGHT? 
All these would have been okay, if not for the completely sexist way the female characters are handled. It doesn't matter if the girls are strong-willed, aloof, or independent, they WILL come to love Kirito at some point. They will need to be saved by Kirito. Even if they are more than capable of handling themselves, the plot will throw some BS their way so that Kirito can shine and get the girl and have them join his ever-growing Harem. 
Now if Sword Art online presented this story in a different way, and made it campy and goofy like To-Love-Ru, it would have been a masterpiece.  The worst part of Sword Art Online is we're supposed to take this seriously. Like there really is this 14 years old kid who plays the entire game solo and has a harem of girls doting over him, and you're supposed to root for him as he overcomes some non-existent challenge and saves the day over and over again.
Watching Sword Art online is like watching a story written by some lonely middle-aged virgin who's never been quite popular with the ladies and spent his youth playing video games. There's no conflict. You know Kirito will save the day somehow. At the same time, it doesn't give the side characters a chance to shine like they do in Overlord or One Punch Man. 
I probably would have hated it less if it weren't for the fact that the popularity of sword art online had somehow inspired a whole generation of writers to write trashy, pointless, harem Isekai (aka stuck in another world) light novels that can be turned into an anime for a quick buck. 
Sword Art online is the worst anime of all time. It shows us just how willing the average consumers are to embrace a story made up of sad, sexist, unoriginal and downright childish delusions. It makes me feels ill knowing that this is the kind of things that are popular with the anime fan. 
Every episode makes me die a little inside. 
Avoid at all cost.",1
"
                Sword Art online was the first anime I watched. You could say I had a rough start.
I'd always been curios about anime and SAO was recommended to me by a friend. Had it not been my first anime, I wouldn't have enjoyed it at all. The premise is really good, but they rush through the story like Kirito is after them. 
Speaking of Kirito, he is the main character. And He's horrible. Seriously, no development besides 'gotta go faster!' But they had such opportunity with him. How does he handle being trapped in a game? 'gotta go faster!' How does he handle PTSD after some
                  events I won't spoil? 'gotta go faster!' How is it that he is awesome at everything he tries? Because he goes faster. I need more from a character then that.
The artwork is nice. Yep.
I can't remember the sound, but I would if I'd hated it.
But I did enjoy it.  I remember being engrossed, watching episode after episode. Because I wanted to know what would happen. Even if I knew Saint Kirito could do no wrong, I wanted to know how the other people would react.
Then the first arc ended. I felt like I'd been slapped in the face. You have questions? To bad. 
I watched the rest of the season because I'd already started. I also watched the Gun Gale arc because why not? Never finished the second season though.
So if you think you should watch it, go ahead. It's not special but it isn't to bad. Just go faster.",5
"
                Sword Art Online is a good anime. It really is. It's the not the greatest anime in the world. It doesn't make you want to convince everyone in your circle that they must watch it, but it is something you'd recommend to someone when they're bored  on a rainy day with  nothing else to do.
The plot had me hooked. I love the idea of people being trapped inside a virtual world and forced to participate in a death game, where dying in the games means you die in the real world. However, the characters leave something to be desired. I mean there really
                  isn't any character development but the characters are still likeable, I guess. 
I suppose I like characters where part of the driving force of the story is the characters overcoming their faults. But it's like the main character has none. And mid-way through the story, I started thinking that the story had veered off course but apparently the overly sweet romance episodes were actually meant to be part of the story.
Actually, that's kind of what this anime does: it switches half-way through into a romance series. The over all goal of returning to the real world is still an objective and focus is brought back to it but it becomes painstakingly clear that anime turns into romance story. That was sneaky.
I'm not a fan of romance animes, per se, and this anime lured me in with action and slapped me in the face with a lovey-dovey couple half way through the first arc. I hate when stuff does that but in any case, I kept watching because, you know... I'd already made it through half the first arc.
The second arc, in my opinion, was kind of unnecessary. But Kirito's confrontation in the real world towards the end was actually pretty good. But then I didn't really care for the last episode. It resolved nothing, in my opinion, in regards to his sister's feelings towards him. But like I said before, the characters were not developed at all. You just have to take them as they are.
Overall, the music was pretty good and the art style good as well. I'd recommend it on a rainy day because while the anime isn't that great, it isn't that bad either.",7

                Klein: ""Argh! Oooh...hurts in the nuts... kill me now...""
-Episode 1
No, but seriously.
When I first began watching SAO, I loved it. I thought it was amazing. Sure it had some minor flaws, but it was forgivable. Fast forward to the second arc. Never so quickly have I seen something be reduced to shit so quickly. It seemed to just down tone itself, going from a death game to fairies frolicking in the woods and whatnot. Everything that made the first arc so wonderful was nowhere to be found in Alfheim Online. I honestly couldn't even pay attention, it was so unbearably boring.
SAO is like getting on
                  a wicked rollercoaster, then getting on a rollercoaster you expect to be even more wicked, only to find out it's a kiddie ride.
Is that a bad comparison? Probably. Does it really matter? No.
The writers took an interesting concept and ruined it. 
The art and sound was nice (with art in the name it better be nice), with some of the songs bringing back nostalgia of the SNES classic Chrono Trigger. It's nice, but who really watches anime just for the visuals or music?
(My first review, don't sue me)",6
"
                The first 5 or so episodes are *so cool* I thought this was going to be great. The first half of the season ended and it was going strong.
Then comes season 2. Along comes creepy incest stuff, annoying lolis and annoying characters. I'd give the first half a 7 and the second half a 1 and because it's so damned bad it just drags the whole rating down for me.
Also the ""extra"" chapter is nothing but a bunch of repeated scenes with lame stuff added.
              ",1
"
                Imagine a game that changes THE WORLD! Not the world of videogames but literally THE WORLD! This show was amazing and I loved it from beginning to end. I loved the concept it started with being a MMO game where people die, they die for real but what it made great to me was that it wasn't limited to that concept. It took that idea and expanded it throughout the next season. While the in-yo-face theme of the second season was about the main character getting back his main love interest and kind of trying to settle himself in to the real world, at the
                  core of the show, you have the idea that the man came up with in the game transform gaming, how people approach life, and passing down his dreams to someone else to make it better. I thought it was a great show and think everyone should at least give it a chance.",9
"
                "" i haven't seen anything related to SAO , except for this adaption so
 my review is going to be based on that "" 
Summary :-
in a not so faraway future , humanity took a huge step towards providing an enjoyable source of entertainment ,, and it was all thanks to creating   (VRMMORPG) games ,, that are supported by a system called the nerve gear , 
this anime follows the story of one the players of the very first (VRMMORPG) game called SAO , with a medieval setting and amazing console "" your brain ""
note : your character is controlled by your brainwaves
                  via something called the nerve-gear 
everyone wants a piece of this lovely game 
after logging in ,, the players realize something THERE IS NO LOG OUT BUTTON "" , the players have to complete the game to get back to the real world ,, easy right ? but here's the plot twist , IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE 
story 7/10 
to be honest the story is a good example of a good plot gone wrong ,, because of it's very dull story line . 
the story follows kirito your everyday weaboo ,, that really adores gaming and his journey in the world of SAO , it had a good start but then it was boring ,, it is like a marriage , first you have the honey moon phase where everything is exciting and wonderful , but after a few months the marriage loses it spark ,, just like this anime it had me in the first few episodes then i was watching it for the sake of watching it , 
like i was saying it follows kirito on his journey of discovering love , emotion , and finding his true self ,, and of-course you can find some fanservice every now and then ,, and you guessed it , it has incest :| ,, but somehow unlike GC , it was quite logical in my point of view , i don't want to ruin it for you so i will be moving on to next section 
characters 7.5/10 
kirito our male lead "" The Black Swordsman ""
the teenaged gamer with the body of a 12 year-old , he is kind , light hearted and socially awkward ,, at 1st you would think that he is a narcissistic idiot but then you will know what he is really about ,, he has your average back story ,, but that story makes you understand his true identity . PLUS HE IS AN EXCELLENT GAMER  
Asuna "" the female lead ""
She is my favorite  character and yes i'm a girl ,, she is the perfect feminist
she can truly protect herself and has a very strong personality without neglecting her female/motherly instincts ,  and yes she falls for our idiotic male lead ,, BOHO ,, that isn't a big surprise , she is caring funny and strong , i think she is one of the reason why SAO is famous ,, i mean her character attracts a lot of people 
for the side characters there are ALOT of those ,, some of them were fillers but there were some that stood out 
before moving on to the next section i have something to say 
if you are a GoT fan then you will love this because a lot of people DIE 
the down side was ,, wait for it ! the fight scenes , they were meh , i didn't feel like it was a life or death situation except for once or twice 
the other thing was the poor character development ,, it only happened in the first few episode and that's it ,, and it was only with kirito and asuna the rest of the characters didn't change much 
7/10
the art was good , the backgrounds were very PRETTY but i wasn't a big fan of the design for the bosses ,, but over all the medieval setting was portrayed nicely 
 6/10 
the voice actors were good but i really HATED the music 
over all 8/10 
this is one of the few time i tackled an anime of this genre i'm a slice of life girl ,, but what pulled  me to  SAO ,, is the fact  that it had everything ,, romance action life lesson etc ,, and that is why it failed like GC ,, not a lot of people can balance that madness and the author of SAO was one of the many victims that couldn't do that , 
if you are into gaming , and like animes that have a good start then a rocky ending , this is where you belong ,, plus if you watch it you can see asuna boobs :| ,, that's it for this review , until we meet again xx",8
"
                So, you may ask, how was this anime?
Story: 6/10
The story is alright and quite simple. The people get trapped in the game.They have to get out. (First Arc) Then, the main character has to save the main heroin from another game. (Second Arc) It wasn't the best and most complex but, it was alright.
Art: 7/10
The art was better than other older anime (obviously). It was colorful and vivid. Overall, the art wasn't so bad.
Sound: 7/10
The music of the ending and intro were all right. The accordion music (was it?) was used to tell us something humorous is happening. However, the epic chorus singing while they
                  were fighting was epic. It was just beautiful. However, other than those and Sachi singing was most of the music. (Not counting swords clashing if that is your ides of music)
Character: 5/10
This was definitely  not the strong part of SAO. Sure, there was character some development and backstory. However, I shall emphasize again: some. The main character spends a episode each for the other three 'minor' heroines and how they develop this harem. And also, one of them dies. Yay. The voice acting was all right, it was good. Also, the only real, developing love in the story revolves around the MC (Not including Yui. God she is cute.).Too bad Klein and Agil.
Enjoyment: 8/10
Despite all these scores, I enjoyed it. I don't know. That is how I am.
Overall:
It was great and I liked it. If only  They made everything else better, I would have liked this more.",8
"
                Despite its flaws, I  still think SAO was outstanding.  I didn't watch the show until like 3.5 years after it aired so I'm not someone who was hyped by it who's writing a late review.  The pacing was bizarre, but I don't think it took away much from the story; it would've been boring watching episode after episode of only boss fights and leveling.  I'll admit that the characters, especially Sachi, Silica, and  Lisbeth should've had more screen time, but each one of them served an important purpose in the show and each experience drove Kirito even further.  They
                  did fall in love with him quickly, but that's understandable considering their situation.  The music scores are amazing as well as the theme songs (Aincrad arc at least); Crossing Field is my second favorite anime opening.  
The fairy dance arc definitely could've been eliminated to make room for an expanded Aincrad arc, but it was pretty good.  Sughua  developed kind of an incest type love, but after being rejected for some time, she was just happy that Kirito was spending time with her again and she lost track of her emotions, in my opinion.  Sugu was a bit too evil, but I think he was a good villain; an overly-evil villain almost always makes for a great scene later on and that scene came in episode 24 (SPOILER after this until the end of this paragraph), where Kirito used Kyaba's admin credentials, summon excalibur, and plunged it into Sugu chest, eventually decapitating him I believe.  
The music and art are just fantastic.  SAO always does an excellent job in these departments.
Overall, the show was very enjoyable and I loved the story.  I think some people just criticize because it was popular or they forced themselves to finish it when they didn't enjoy it and that caused more hate to develop.  For those of you who really hate this show, you should've known character development and story wasn't going to be really deep since it's rated tv-13.  Think before you criticize the show and don't hate on it due to the fan-base or the ratings from others.
I will warn you.  The Fairy Dance arc will lose some of its entertainment value after a while. Basically, I doubt you'll be re-watching the arc as much as the first one.",9
"
The sword art online anime was probably some of the best anime i have ever seen. The story was really great, I shouldnt have so much to say about the story. It´s hard to explain it without you haveing a understanding for the anime.
The art, well just amazing. This is probably my favorite ""art"" anime.
The vocies are all great, and the soundeffects for the swords and weapons are really fitting.
The main characters for this anime is my favorite characters in every anime i have ever seen. It´s exactly the sorts of charcters i like, scared, brave, romantic and amazing. The way all the characters look
                  are also very awsome.
It´s really exciting and good. I cried about 3-5 times during this anime.
I can´t probably explain how amazing this anime really is for me.
My top favorite thing about this anime:
The bond between all the charcters and also the fellings in the series.
You can really tell and feel how amazing the fellings of the characters are.
My top WORST thing about this anime:
It´s way to few episodes, i am not saying this becuase of how much i wants this anime, but the fact that they jump WAY to much between the episodes.
It could have been so much more to this anime then you actually could think.
So thats the biggest and probably the only problem.
But overall i still gives this anime a 10/10 raiting.
I do this becuase of how the anime could ""touch my heart"".
I know that maybe this sounds random. But if you really are a true anime fan i think you should be able to understand what i mean.",10

                Here we go! Sword Art Online.
Story-
Ehh, it's pretty good I should say. It portrays a digitalized future where you can go into a video game realm. A basic MMORPG anime storyline. Sword Art Online being different from other MMORPG anime is that they go into the video game world by choice, more than by coincidence.
I say the story is neither good, nor bad.
Art-
Not much to say here. The art is unarguably good. It has nice, vibrant colors, as well with good backgrounds and character designs.
Sound-Same with art. It was good quality sound. As a person who can't stand non-quality audio, I was quite pleased.
Characters-
This will be a long one, and for that sake I'm only including characters who had major appearance.
Kirito- Pro gamer, in Sword Art Online categorized as a 'beater' Has a big group known as 'The Rejected Womans Club' Kirito has major plot armor, for example being countlessly stabbed with swords yet still can stand and defeat the villain. I can see the creators trying to add elements of harem, fantasy, gaming, romance, adventure, and comedy into this anime.
Asuna- Perfect waifu. Is the absolutely perfect person. Not exactly Mary Sue, but close-ish. Asuna is good at cooking and being the perfect wife character and is amazing on the battlefield. 
Yui- Oh! Let's add in a program for plot convenience to the characters! That's pretty much what Yui is. She is a program glitch that helps Kirito and Asuna. Without Yui, the anime would be much longer with more defaults. Yui pretty much helps keep the anime without major problem and keeps it shorter.
Enjoyment-
I say, my enjoyment is quite mundane. I wasn't totally hyped, but not totally 'Oh! I love this anime!'
Overall-
I say it is quite in the middle. I don't have major connections but I don't totally hate it. If you like unrealistic characters that don't show faults and an 'ish' storyline, I guess you would enjoy this anime.",5
"
                The show has a shit ton of plot holes. It always goes against what its says and the MC is so OP you'll never be on the edge of your seat during the fights. The MC has so many girls in love with him it makes me cringe. And one of the girls is his sister. 
The sound track has some slightly memorable songs but none really stood out too much.
The characters are as thin as paper and have no development what so ever and are usually discarded after the MC fools with them a bit.
Overall, this show is a piece of shit, nothing makes
                  sense and there are so many cringey moments. I wanted to die the whole time watching it>",1
"
                Well, this is the first review I'm doing on myanimelist, and I had to make one for SAO, after all it was the first anime I've watched!
Sword Art Online was the first anime I’ve watched and this was the anime that got me hooked. Overall I thought that this anime was a great, fun anime to watch, and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn’t watched it yet. I really enjoyed the first story ark where the characters get trapped in SAO. That story ark by itself would get a rating of 8.8 from me, but after that I didn’t like the other story
                  arks nearly as much. In the second season, ALO and GGO were quite boring in my opinion. The second
season would get a 7.9 rating from me.
Plot- The plot was good overall, not the greatest, but 
still quite good. It didn’t go into too much depth
and detail, and to be honest it was very predictable.
Characters- The characters and their personalities were
decent in my opinion, but unlike other shows I didn’t feel really feel attached, and they weren’t really relatable.
Soundtrack- The soundtrack, opening and endings in this anime were excellent. There were many different endings and openings and they were all of high quality. I think the soundtrack in this anime would be some of the best out of all the anime shows out there
Overall, great show. And if you haven't watched it yet, you should!",8
"
                You realy hear a lot about Sword Art Online. It is in the top 10 of each anime site out there, most of the times.
And this is what makes me angry.
Because Sword Art isn't as good as the people make you think.
It is only watched so often, because so many of us have played online games themselfes or are still playing.
But even that isn't so big of a deal, because there are plenty of other fish out there swimming the same flow.
Boy gets transferred into MMORPG, levels up, kills guys. Girls on his way fall in love for his passion.
How unexpected...NOT!
Sword Art Online is just a highly budget mainstream shounen with a flat storyfiller. The animation is rendered, many might like this sharp style but I don't.
One good thing about Sword Art Online, is that it only has 2 seasons right now. 
So you don't get trapped into the 400 episodes shounen black hole, if you already started.
If you didn`t, just look for another anime.",7
"
                (WARNING. I CANNOT GUARANTEE THIS IS SPOILER FREE)
Okay first off let's talk about the story!
It's set in a near future where virtual reality gaming exists and when this new game ""Sword Art Online"" comes out, on it's debut the log out button has disappeared and people are trapped. The only way to get out is to clear all 100 levels of the game and beat the boss.
First impressions? I thought it sounded pretty cool! Virtual-reality gaming has always been a dream of mine, also the whole idea of being trapped in that game and then having to clear it sounded like an interesting idea.
However when
                  it gets down to detail (including the characters) it felt a little dull and the plot twists in the story seem a little predictable and there was nothing fresh to be seen once you settle into the flow of it.
But on the other hand, the pace of this anime was really good. It wasn't too rushed and it wasn't too dragged out. 
Now moving onto the characters.
The main characters, Kirito and Asuna, both REALLY REALLY REALLY annoyed me. Mainly at the start and towards the end. Also they were very annoying in between.
I felt the story was TOO MUCH about them two. I mean yes. They are the main characters but there was no space to breathe because they were both being shoved down your throat.
Another character who annoyed me is Kirito's little sister and Leafa who appears in the 2nd half of the anime, but I guess this is because it's hard to except someone who wasn't there originally. I found them both terribly annoying and I couldn't warm to them.
Okay at one point I felt sorry for Leafa because of something. But even then I was thinking ""Yeahhh.... Still don't like you.""
However other characters were actually quiet likeable! (I'm pretty fond of Lizz  and Klein).
It's actually a shame other characters aren't featured enough in this anime so I felt like they were a waste of good characters. 
I felt this way especially for Klein! At the end of episode 1 it felt like Klein would play a MAJOR role in the anime. However he was only seen just every now and again not really doing anything but killing off some monsters with Kirito.
Same with other characters, there is this build up which makes you think you'll see them more, but no... Just no...
As for designs, I thought they were really good so there isn't anything to say here.
Now the art.
Animation was questionable at times...
Notice the first opening when Asuna is walking. It looks rather.... Weird.... Just... Weird... There are a few weird animating problems unfortunately. 
I thought the art style was pretty good and it suited the story and the characters.
Now for sound!
1st Opening theme tune was really good! I've got it saved on my mp3, I thought it really fitted the anime well and it was well performed.
The end tunes and the 2nd opening didn't feel as special.
Voice acting was done really well in my opinion!
They sounded natural and none of the voices sounded awkward.
Overall it's a pretty good anime, but I'm not sure it's a ""master piece"".
There wasn't really anything that got me excited but I was happy enough to continue watching~!",7
"
                Sword Art Online was quite the controversial anime with half the fans loving it and the other half hating it. There is almost always one anime that gets overly hyped and fans are cut in half over why you should/shouldn't love it. SAO took this hype pretty far. While I didn't watch it when it was first released, I watched it recently after a 'friend' claimed it was better than FMA Brotherhood. So in a rage, I watched it while calmly trying to give it an unbiased chance of a good score. Now it has been almost 2 months since I've watched SAO so this
                  is probably the most unbiased I could be.
The concept of SAO is fantastic. The gamers of the otaku community will probably love this to death. The idea is soo wonderful and fun that it can hide the flaws of this anime. In the first half of the SAO, I too was getting quite excited about the plot. Things didn't turn out so well though.
The first flaw of SAO is the pacing. Many people have complained about time skipping and it ruining the story. I'm a bit mixed on this. To fit 2-3 years in 12 episodes is a difficult thing to do well. It makes sense to have some time skips to get along with the story. The problem is, the timeskips weren't handled very well. It often felt detached to the main story. You could take it as character development but you don't see the character really develop from whatever events he went through. There is progress within each mini arc, but it doesn't help progress the overall plot.
I mentioned how the characters weren't really developed. The characters were honestly, the worst part of this anime. I've always heard these stereotypes of Mary Sue/Gary Stu and I never really understood what they were until SAO. Kirito (the main character) was a beta player so he knows a few nooks and crannies about the game. However, the creators took advantage of this and made it the entire reason Kirito can 'pwn' the game. Kirito does go through some traumatic experiences but I felt these experiences weren't taken seriously. Yes Kirito does go back and think about said experiences, but he never actually makes anything out of it. There's no smooth character development, if there is any at all.
Asuna is quite the same. She is introduced to be this mysterious, strong character but as soon as she becomes a main focus, she switches to a tsundere and then just....nothing really. She's just there for Kirito and the fanboy's delight. There is straight up nothing going for her except for her looks and her maxed out cooking skill.
And those are the main characters. There are other characters like Kirito's younger 'sister' and the villain and the random girls Kirito meet. But it is all basically a harem with the main route following Asuna. Don't even get me started on the second half of SAO. The only thing going for it was the wings. Can't really say more than that though coz of spoilers :/
A couple of good points is the art. SAO was done by A-1 Pictures and it is absolutely stunning. The motion is fluid, the colours are bright and appealing. Just thinking about it makes me wish I was playing SAO. They set up a world that fulfills every gamers' dreams. What set the world more was the music. Yuki Kajiura is well known for her beautiful compositions. She has been part of other anime such as Tsubasa Chronicles and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. I personally adore her works. It always manages to get me pumped over anything. SAO was no different. It was a treat to hear her unique soundtrack as we watched Kirito kill the next giant boss. The gaming world is also another concept done well. All the battles, the skill sets, the customization can make any gamer froth at the mouth. 
You can see where SAO received its hype from. While the story and characters were quite horrible, the ideas and concepts behind it pushed through. The world of SAO is incredibly appealing to the point that the story and characters are minor bumps along the ride. To the critical watcher though, the flaws can be so obvious that watching it may be difficult. SAO is far from a great anime. If anything, it's mediocre. It felt a bit like a waste of time for me, but I also felt it was something I had to watch. I just wish it wasn't so urgent that it took priority over other anime I would much prefer to watch.",6
"
                Where do I begin.
SAO is one of the most splendid animes ever made. Personally I love it for the main pro-tag-on-nist Kirito. He is so epic, he is so epic that he can use OVERPOWERED swords.
A lot of people hate SAO ... However, I personally think that Kirito is the thing which makes SAO so fantastic. 
Story - 10/10 - The story contains Kirito, it's enjoyable and entertaining.
Art - 10/10 - Kirito looks amazing.
Sound - 10/10 - Kirito sounds so fantastic
Characters - 10/10 - Klein is alright, however Kirito really takes the show
Enjoyment - 10/10 - Kirito is basically the reason why the show felt
                  so epic and relatable.
I'd recommend this to anyone who loves Kirito",10

                Story:
This part of the anime focuses more on romance instead of the game and personally I love this type of story of game made into real life. To me this anime although it jumped a bit the part of the game itself, still has a lot of action inside it, you can clearly see the hardships of the characters not only with themselves but with other characters as well. Here the romance is almost the main focus that helps the story to develop, although that doesn't come from the very beginning it becomes clear that it is like that
Art:
Tthe art in this anime is very
                  beautiful, sometimes it may not seem like anything out of the ordinary, but other times you can see that the art is actualy very beautifull, the special effects of the attacks and the scenery has very beautiful colors
Character:
The more time the characters are in the game the more painfully aware they are of the reality that the game isn't a game anymore, I think that because of that they evolve in a harsher way than they would in case they were still in real life and not in the game seeing as the people actually die.
Overall I think it's totally worth it, this anime was the first anime I saw with this kind of genre and I loved it although it's a game it shows crystal clear the hardships of real life while playing a game.",10

                cutting to the chase this is a must watch anime and it is somewhat funny but mostly so intense that it will glue you to the screen , basically it is a love story and  it gives you many life lessons that you can use in your real life as well ,the most important lesson is to NEVER GIVE UP ,EVEN IF THERE IS A -100% CHANCE OF SUCCESS , YOU WILL EVENTUALLY GET SOMETHING GOOD IN RETURN. now back to the anime there will be no spoilers from me and therefore      it will be a original review ,
                  as the story progresses you will fall in love the side chracters . THE MAIN REASON why i watch anime is because the extent of real emotions shown in anime are so realistic that they can not be created in movies or dramas, maybe that is the only reason why i prefer anime over movies or dramas .",10

                OH NO ANOTHER SAO REVIEW! Look I'm not a SAO fanboy nor am I a close minded bitch. I like to think I'm somewhere in the middle. I definitely don't think this deserves a 10 and I don't think it deserves 1s and 2s. From what I've seen, I'm probably gonna give this a 7 or 8 depending on how the show continues. However after just finishing episode 15, I think that people who did give the show really low scores should get to this point before they make their final score decision.
Much like steins;gate the first half of the series (from what I can
                  tell so far in SAO) is possibly worse than the second. And in the end, what people who rate the show low are expecting when they begin the show, is an action/fighting anime, which this show is not. This show is a love story, but that story point doesn't flourish until latter in the story.
I think before anyone, on either end of the rating system, should wait at least until episode 15 to make their decisions.",7

                Sword Art Online is what I would define as an anime that has marked anime history in my opinion.
Though the story may not be original (I mean, sure .hack// already took the idea of a virtual reality MMORPG that kills it's players way before SAO), it has made its spot as onf of my number top anime of all time. I've been a fan of SAO since the light novel and I appreciated how the anime stayed true to it's story line and didn't modify everything to make it more appealing to the viewer (Though the light novel was way more than appealing enough so
                  no modification was required anyways). Heck, chapter 16.5... If you know what I'm talking about. :3
Animation:
The animation was what I'd define as top notch. The fighting scenes felt smooth and were always exciting to watch. Never did I feel bored watching these awesome action packed fighting scenes because the movements flowed so well. The lighting up when a character was charging a skill, the epic skills themselves actually in both Sword Art Online and ALfheim Onine were flashy and cool to watch.
Music:
The opening has gained a spot in my heart as one of the best anime openings of all time. Just by listening to it with the animated sequence that accompanied it at the end of episode 1, I knew this series was going to be epic. The battle music was also great and well composed to match the moment.
Characters:
Each character has it's own unique personalty that made them likable or hate-able, depending if they were the protagonist or the antagonist. In almost every SAO episode, we are introduced to a new character and even if their appearance is only an episode long, they still play an important role that makes the story move on. In the ALO arc, a new set of characters was introduced but they are as lovable as the SAO ones. So much shipping..
Storyline:
As mentioned earlier, this anime isn't the first of it's kind, but it honestly surpasses by a long shot it's predecessors (Maybe cause the animation is better due to technology advancement? I did enjoy the .//hack series very much though.) In 14 episodes, Sword Art Online has showed most of the important moments of the novels and I felt like I was reading parts the novels as I watched a new episode of SAO every Saturday. Same with the ALfheim Online arc.
Overall:
Sword Art Online was very satisfying and the story was great, I wished in lived in 2022, a time where NerveGears allow people to dive into the world of their game of choice, SAO in my case and I wouldn't mind being stuck in the game world and risking my life, because that's what makes it thrilling and makes me want to surpass myself in order to survive. Without any risks, any game would be so dull.
Rating:
Even though SAO was absolutely amazing, it still has things that could have been improved and so it can't get a perfect score.",8

                First review ~ (it'll be quite brief)
Story 7
A story based on mmorpgs was a great idea but it turned quite ridiculous. I enjoyed the first arc, the second less. I think the bigger problem is there is too much love, the story got lost.
Art/Sound 10
I have nothing to say but that i loved the art and sounds. The landscapes are so beautiful.
Character 7
Even though there was a lot of fanservice, i liked the character of Kirito and Asuna is so cute. However, the others are not developed enough. Generally, the characters are too cliche.
Enjoyment 9
I enjoyed yet the action, the pace of the story. I didn't get bored !
Overall 8
It's a good anime, without morality, reflexion or anything, with many defects, but very enjoyable. I recommend it to you if you want to have fun.",8
"
                Putrid bile. Filth. Abomination.
The story starts promising with a death game premise where it is explained that 100 floors must be cleared in a game world to survive and in game death means real life death. This is a semi-standard death game horror premise. So when something like this is written in for the first episode, you expect there to be the threat of death looming and extreme danger right? Narrative stakes where characters could die at any moment and mistakes from other players showing their demise throughout the story?
A 100 floor virtual reality mmo with RPG settings. You would expect an adventure where the
                  MC collects items and improves his stats and gear, has epic fights with a variety of unique monsters and uses strategy to overcome his battles right?
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha....
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
No. This is actually a harem romance anime where there is absolutely 0 threat to the MC. There is a time skip almost immediately where  half the floors are skipped (because who would want to see the MC's initial progress and rise from weak to strong right?) and the MC is already fucking invincible for no reason. Oh sorry, there is a reason, it's just utterly retarded. He has the fastest reflexes so that means he can use 2 swords (*SOYFACE OMG DUAL WIELDING!!!*) and no one else can :), he's a beta tester (all the other players are first responders, you'd expect them to be hardcore gamers) so that means while every other person is failing and incompetent, this teenager is a God among men who can solo raid bosses. These bosses don't seem to possess any interesting abilities, drop no cool items, don't require any strategy to beat and have no sense of sentience.
The ""characters"" mostly don't exist. I mean there are people(?) that have names and stuff, but they behave mostly like NPCs. There are two characters (MC and Asuna) that have any kind of development at all. MC is gary stu cardboard extraordinaire and Asuna is his faithful sandwich making cumslut.
Sometimes the story moves, I think about 5% of the show moves the plot forward although that might be generous. Most time is spent on showing Kirito collecting harem members before forgetting about them or sexing woman slave #1.
The main overarching villain has a very deep ideology that drives him to perform his devilish actions. Think he smoke a joint and forgot tho, ""yooooo dude I totally had like a crazy idea... what if I just trapped some people in the game and shit *puffs* haha that'd be tight bro."" The MC is supposed to lose but God comes down from the heavens and revives Jesus-kun. I almost wanted to give this a 2 because I've never seen such a shameless deus ex machina in any story and I do love shamelessness, but sadly there is nothing to signify that this story is self aware at any level.
The 2nd part with the pedophile netorare tentacle rape and the dumb incestous teen who constantly gets fanservice shots of their crotch didn't even phase me at this point. If it leaned a little harder into these points I would've thought it was ironic and praised this story a bit more, but it seems to just perfectly be plausibly terrible enough that you know it actually is written just that badly.
I must admit this is the worst story I've ever sat all the way through. I have never been so perfectly baited into a story quite like this, so kudos to SAO.",1
"
                Sword Art Online has every extra thing going for it. Beautiful soundtracks, vivid settings and nice character designs. The music is beautiful and adds to the series so much. The set up of the series initially was perfect, the tension and scale were marvelous. However, mid season it became a generic slice of life rom-com and that may not have mattered as much had the romance been believable or characters interesting. All the characters are generic archetypes; lolita, tsundere, etc. Kirito has absolutely no personality besides being emo because he thinks wearing black is cool. Each girl in his generic harem get one episode each
                  and then are never important again. The action was however, a highlight. Despite his second match against the main antagonist being horrible and deus ex-machina, his first match was done better and felt much more intense. THe boss battles are brilliant as well when in sync with the soundtrack it is an epic. I'm not getting to the second half because that was entirely based off a romance that never worked in the first place. Overall I believe enjoyment of this series comes from how you watch it. If you watch it as an outsider you notice just how weak the characters are and how unfocused the plot is, but if you put yourself into the protagonists shoes as Kirito is simply a wish fulfillment character I'm sure you would enjoy having your own harem, kicking ass and wearing black all the time.",4

                It's a virtual world, but I still feel more alive here than in the real world -Kirigaya Kazuto
Without a doubt ... the worst and most stupid phrase that I have heard in my life.
(THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)
Disclaimer:
English is not my native language so I may have mistakes.
Story 2.5/10:
In principle, the first chapter is interesting but after the anime generates expectations and ends up ruining them with it's terrible development and characters as the episodes go by.
The arc of Sword art online is a fictional world that is supposed to be if you die in the virtual world, you die in the real one, a super interesting plot that ends up being one more generic anime since it does not develop at all, the rules of the game No!.does not go into depth ... also how is the game so sold if not even 20 thousand people bought it? XD
There have been video games that have had more sales than that.
The story has the benefit of the script all the time, it's monotonous, the story tries to surprise you but it does not succeed, the scenes that it has ... horrible, really, think of some epic battle scene that is well carried and also does not win Kirigaya. DEFINITELY, THERE ISN'T. (Well,there is a fight were he loses,but the person what he was fighting..was using hacks)
The series tries to take itself seriously and the truth is LAUGH.
The romance in this series is so toxic and forced ... well, the romance I will touch on further in the character section.
The alfheim / fairy dance arc is HORRIBLE. It is like the copy of the first 14 episodes only worse and in another game that on top of it is about horrible fairies. A huge world full of possibilities to explore but NO, what does Kirito do? He goes looking for his girlfriend while having scenes of dubious comfort with his cousin. That's the alfheim arc, and in the Sword art online arc it's pretty much the same, plot-ruining romance that feels forced.
The places are named above and the characters instead of developing with it no.., also instead of Kirito moving with the plot, Kirito himself tries to move it and it feels unnatural and very noticeable. There should be arches from each place of the game but the places..NO! They name them above and do not give them any importance, literally, it is that they do nothing more than wander the world and there is nothing to highlight from a scene except one that I will name in the characters section that is to laugh and is of the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Alfheim:1/10
SAO:4/10
Art 5/10:
The truth ... although it was animated by A-1 Pictures ... it is of doubtful quality, if the art seems to me somewhat ugly in some scenes and sometimes it looks deformed, the art of fights is bad and good at the same time, in my opinion, the best of sao's art are the character designs, backgrounds and eyes, because afterwards there is a lot of deformity, but ... there are exceptions, it is in itself a bipolar art, bad and good at the same time.
OST and voice acting 6/10:
This is the best of the series ...
OST: I think the OST is quite good, it has many remarkable songs and it is entertaining in some parts ... although there are songs that don't convince me, but for the most part it is very good and the songs almost always match with the scenes.
Voice acting: The voices are good but there are some voices that don't convince me like Lisbeth's voice.
OP and ED 8/10:
(I won't count this section with the score)
In principle, in addition to the songs that are used in the background in the scenes, the openings and endings are the best of anime.
The opening is magnificent, I loved the choice of song, LisA's Crossing Field is magnificent and iconic, very catchy and in my opinion it's never boring, I never get tired or never skip it.
I also love the ending, I found it interesting that Asuna's seiyuu interpreted it, it's very beautiful and I don't get tired, although sometimes I skipped it.
The second opening and the second ending are quite good and I loved them, very good.
Although it seems to me that such a bad series as SAO doesn't deserve those openings and endings.
Character 1/10:
The characters are the worst of the series in addition to the poorly managed plot that the anime has.
Kirigaya Kazuto: 
The worst thing I've seen in an anime protagonist, inhuman, the most unreal thing I've seen, his feelings don't feel very realistic when he expresses them, his powers don't make any sense and he's completely idealized by the same author, Reki Kawahara,Kirito is A generic Gary Stu.
In the first chapters he is an acceptable character, making the hatred of people who hate betatesters fall on him is acceptable, he took a risk, but ... the character is ruined when he enters the Moonlit Black Cats guild, trying to hide his true level, so that others don't get mad at having someone stronger in their guild! I mean, that never happens, if there is someone experienced in the game on a team, that person is supposed to be the most respected. And thanks to hiding their level, everyone dies. Also, when he takes care of a girl with Asuna for an alleged murder that happened to a friend of the girl, they don't take care of her, they leave her completely alone, what irresponsibility,my god.And then when they all get together to speak the girl who is in danger of death stays standing in front of the wall and well..Kirito instead of helping her, lets her ""die"" since she didn't really die. Then there is a scene in which A final boss assassinates an army and what does Kirito do? Well, he ends up taking his new ability of 2 swords that he had discovered a few months ago and that not even the viewer knew that he had that ability and well ... kill the final boss in VERY LITTLE TIME and then he let ruin the scene and end up being forced. And well ... a ""Kirito's Beneficence"" is that he can ruin a plot and he can also make 4 girls fall in love in 8 chapters. Then there is a situation in which he ends up murdering someone who almost kills him ... and instead of feeling guilty since he lost one hand in the act and killed someone,his girlfriend Asuna was there, after killing the guy he ends up kissing her, the most normal, obvious and you know what Kirito does? is 15 years old and well, It don't affect him at all!
After that ... later with Asuna they arrive at the house, having a very ... sensual atmosphere)? .. and then after Asuna was almost completely naked, Kirito tells her that he just wanted to sleep, yes of course. Later, with Asuna they buy a house in the forest, and you know what?, even though Asuna is his girlfriend, Well ... let's buy separate beds!.
Then, they adopt a girl and seek to see if she has parents, later an army girl tells them a strange story and well, Kirito's girlfriend, with 4 friendly neurons, thinks and says: We should not trust, it can be a trap ... and then their ""daughter"" tells them better to trust and well, what does Kirito say? I think we should trust, it is also better to risk and regret it than to doubt and regret it, I would not trust if it were him, because ... SAO, it is a game in which you die in the game and in real life!, YOU HAVE SAID THE SAME KIRITO, REGRET, TWO TIMES TO REFER TO 2 DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES. And then they also take to the place that it may be a trap for the girl!, What irresponsible parents, after they are almost attacked, for the benefit of the script Yui saves them, so that later, they go to a room with a kind of computer in which he exposes his computer skills by hacking the system to turn their daughter into an item,How easy, 15 years old and with those skills.
Then with the army they will fight against a powerful monster ... here comes the good thing! After killing the monster, the guild boss paralyzes them all and tries to kill Kirito, but since the creator does not want to kill the protagonist, he makes Asuna by the power of love he frees herself from paralysis to save Kirito from being killed, how normal, right? Then, Kirito is killed but for strange reasons he revives and ends up killing the final boss of the game, how convenient, right?
Well, that above was from the first part, the second part is the same but worse, Kirito with convenience from the script for everything,makes falls in love more girls without sense and kills final bosses and well ... the same, a character, that I don't understand how people love him.
Yuuki Asuna:
A horrible character, a girl who could have been one of the best characters but thanks to her toxic romance with the stupid protagonist, she ends up becoming a stereotypical shonen girl who must be there to give fanservice to the horny teenager on duty.
She was a girl who didn't depend on a man, it's not that i hate female characters that are not strong and ""feminine"", I love Honda Tohru's character. Likewise, she is also a stupid character and dependent on Kirito-kun can sometimes be something rational and that thinks with the small brain that she has. Asuna is a character that could have been good but the tsunami of a sexualized girl of the shonen that has to be in a relationship with the protagonist caught her off guard. To sum up, Asuna could have been a good character but ended up being a clumsy stupid girl who depends on the protagonist, who sometimes has a brain.
Kirigaya Suguha:
Horrible, it's almost as horrible as its brother but at least she is more acceptable than the one.
In principle, her relationship with her cousin has an acceptable development and is not a: I love you oniichan!
Although, his character gives a lot of cringe to the viewer in many situations despite having an acceptable development, and it's thanks to the romance with Kirito, how can you fall in love with a relative? XD
It would have been better for them to go deeper into that since how the subject was touched was somewhat forced and cringous.Almost is best character 
In short, SAO, it did horrible.The series never gives great importance to characters other than Kirito, I summarize, Lisbeth is useless, Silica had a lot of potential but it was wasted when she falls in love in Kirito, Klein ... he had potential, Yui is irritating. And then the series doesn't give much importance to other characters, those would be the most notable ""secondary"" although they're not since they don't contribute anything to the plot and they are completely bland.
Character Design:
The character design was really good in this series, really creative and very interesting, but I feel like with a good character design that ended up being created in vain since the series they belong to is VERY bad.
Enjoyment 3/10:
I just got bored in a lot of scenes, it also gave me cringe and also  wanted to drop the series.
It was a completely embarrassing experience.
Final thoughts:
Sword art online could have been a good series if it weren't for the poorly written and cliche protagonist it has. The series is completly generic,which in my opinion is a complete waste of time.
Characters: Completely pathetic.
Animation: It could have been better although there were scenes in which it was something beautiful, the most remarkable thing is the backgrounds.
The author doesn't know how to deal with female characters or male characters, simply pathetic.
Describing SAO in two words...PATHETIC and GENERIC",3
"
                Anime started very well, it was one of the best anime currently airing... But when ALFhein series started, whole anime is just getting worse... Too much ""naked"" scenes, which makes me sick... And at the beginning every ep, was really fun and I enjoyed watching it. Now, I just can't stand it... The plot is nowadays sloooooow... From 10 (I gave to this anime) to 7 now... And this is only because the first part was so awesome.
              ",7
"
                I recently rewatched this, so I might as well write a quick review.
From what I've read on several forums, this anime is considered a ""guilty pleasure"". Not for any kind of mature content, cause that's barely there, but for the fact that people say they hate this, yet they've watched all the episodes, back then waiting for each episode to come out. And I'm just going to say that I personally love this anime for what it is, but I can definitely say it's not perfect. But there definitely are reasons for its flaws, not just because of the anime itself, but other reasons. I'll
                  explain later.
The story is rushed, but a lot of fun to sit through. It revolves around a guy who's playername is ""Kirito"", a former beta tester and now player of Sword Art Online, the first VRMMO ever made (in 2022). But after being in the game for a while, he notices he can't log out, and then realizes along with everyone else they're trapped, and there's no way to get out except for beating the 100 stages, or face death. A rather harsh truth, but Kirito accepts his fate and fights his way to top, along with his friends that he meets along the way.
Now, I wouldn't say this story is original. I believe it's similar to "".hack"", although I can't confirm that, but even then, the main focus is struggling to survive in an alternate world. And without the VR part, this would be rather bland. But it's the whole idea of Virtual Reality that makes this anime so interesting. Especially considering the advances and developments in this area, a concept like a VRMMO is getting within our reach, and I myself am really looking forward to this point, and whether or not I'm an old man by then, I'll still use and play it. And it's this whole concept that attracts most of the viewers, wondering what it would be like when we finally reach that point. I'm sure looking forward to it.
The art and music... Amazing. Absolutely amazing. At least for the first half, the second half of the 25 episodes which revolves around a different world doesn't feel as great, but still pretty good. The art style is really good, and especially the technical VR bits feel nicely integrated into the anime, even though it has a more 3D-ish feel than the anime itself. The backgrounds, the skies, landscaping, it all looks simply astonishing, and is something I missed in animes lately. You can tell they spent quite some time into making this anime look as good as it is. And the music compliments the art with songs that make you feel like you're in an actual MMORPG. Whenever I heard the Swordland theme starting to play (main theme), I was at the edge of my seat and wondering what epic battle would satisfy my need for well... Epic battles, I guess. And when there's a calm scene, the music actually put me in a bit of a trance. It's just that great, at least in my opinion, and it could definitely be re-used in an MMO(RPG), while still doing a great job satisfying us with great tunes.
Now for the lesser bits. The overall character development is where the anime shows its flaws. As the story, and especially the first arc/half progresses, you'll notice there isn't a lot of time to get to know the characters better. Heck, even Kirito doesn't really open up unless he has some kind of revelation about how to see his life, whether or not he should fight for himself, etc. Asuna, the other main character and later on girlfriend of Kirito (you can call this a spoiler, but if you didn't see this one coming...), also feels a bit shallow, although the scenes with both characters in it are pretty nice on its own. The side characters (Klein, Egil, Lizbeth, Silica, Sachi, etc.) are well, your average anime side characters. We got a childish one, a cute one, a shy one, a slightly perverted yet energetic one, and so on. And when they're on screen, they're a lot of fun to watch. A shame pretty much none of them get any screentime in the second half, but oh well.
Lastly, I got to add something about the story as a whole. The original Light Novel was in my opinion far too short to be adapted into an anime, and I believe it got its debut because of Accel World, who's original author is the same as SAO. Fortunately, and you might not know this if you haven't read the novels, they tied in the side stories with the anime, not just because it's filler, but because it really helps in terms of story and character development. And fortunately, this wasn't that necessary in the second arc, but it shows that they really knew what they were doing.
So in conclusion, I give it a 9, simply because they did a pretty good job adapting the light novel into an anime. Heck, they did a better job than the manga, and I think that says a lot, as often people compare animes to the manga version. And of course for its great art, epic story (even though a bit rushed), great music, lovely characters, and overall a great experience. Fair enough, the second arc isn't as great as the first, but it does work nicely by extending the story while not feeling as forced as you may have experienced with other animes. I definitely recommend it if not only you're into VR, but if you're also into epic battles and awesome characters. Link Start!",8

                You know what. I seen this for the first time in my life after having seen over 50 different series already, and none have produced the amount of emotion, and pure enjoyment I have felt watching this series. From the very beginning, if you come into anything with a bias, in any aspect of life, you are doing it wrong. PERIOD. If you come into something expecting, YOU WILL ALWAYS be let down. That's your life lesson for the rest of your life. Now listen up. I actually honestly expected all the hatred and malice that everybody shared for this series to be true. But
                  my god. The intial visuals. I almost cried there on episode 1 seeing Klein and Kirito standing on that island with the scenery in the background. Constant fighting, its all about fighting. If you are a person to complain about fillers, this has no fillers. This incorporates everything in life, all in an anime, in a game. But the beauty of this is everything, not just anything. The characters, the fact they can bring a character in for one episode and make me cry more in 5 minutes than I have cried for entire series that were supposed to be heart wrenching. Now it is pretty easy for me to find enjoyment in things because I particularly have no bias.. as I stated, but I have no bias anywhere, I don't judge, I am not that type of person. Which is also why I felt so drawn to this character. Kirito. I am him, in game and out of game.  Not in the sibling situation though. But the main aspects of this character I feel I have been able to find myself more like than I have ever related with all the characters I have seen combined. I actually felt like I was playing in the game that he was in but did not have to do anything but follow along. You really have to experience everything for yourself of course, but really don't let people who say, ""I am going to tell you the truth about it, its overrated and it sucks"" stop you from watching and having your own opinion. Because so long as you go in with a clear mind there is nothing you should not enjoy from this series.",10

                I have never been more let down by a show before , this show started so well that i would call it spectacular , the story was intriguing and tense at times with plenty of moments that i really liked but this was just for the first 14 episodes , the other 11 episodes or the 2nd half was a huge letdown that just made me wonder why it didn't end when it was still about SAO.
It starts with introducing us to Kirito the stories main character as he enters into this game called Sword Art Online using the ""nerve gear"" however things weren't pretty
                  as all the players soon found themselves to be stuck within the game with almost no way to escape unless they beat the all the floors to the dungeon but here is the catch , if they die in game they are pretty much done for in real life. Sounds interesting doesn't it ? Well it certainly was and i can't deny that.
The first half of the show was highly enjoyable , i really liked how it set it self apart from other animes that are based on games by making death something that had to be considered by the characters in the unknown world they were trapped in. This brought stakes to whatever actions the characters took be it exploring new floors , venturing into secret rooms or even trusting people and this aspect of dread and just wanting to stay alive really sold it for me.
Now for the second part .... I really hated this part and all the arcs that followed , whatever i just explained above was not there any more and it suddenly became just another bland OP MC anime that we have seen a million times now. Do i also have to explain how stupid the villain and his motives were ? 
As for the characters , the only ones i actually really emphasized and cared about were just Kirito , Asuna and to some extent Yui as this characters were the only to have gotten any development throughout the show to be honest with you. The rest of the characters are what i would call throw away characters that are just there to make it into another bullshit harem situation for the MC , Rika and Keiko are the same characters as when they first appeared and are given little to none character development , Klein a character which i personally really enjoyed is also given the same treatment where he is given so little screen time and development that it felt like a shame as he was a really enjoyable character that i loved every moment he was in the show and of course what is a harem without a bland overused brocom little sister character right ? yeah i am talking about Suguha and she could disappear for all i care.
Art and animation is nice , not the best but not the worst either , some fight scenes were animated extremely well while some of the other scenes could look pretty average at times. Monsters and character designs were actually pretty decent and i really loved how some of them looked. As for the sound i really didn't like the OP's or ED's but the OST were extremely stellar.
Overall , this is a show i would recommend you to watch for the first 14 episodes and then decide for yourself whether you want to watch the rest of it as while i may have despised the 2nd half some of the people i have talked to enjoyed it so make that judgement for yourself.",6

                (Wow so many people say that many people love this series, but the review page is full of scores like 1 or 3)
To write a review about such a controversial series is very dangerous, but I'll try my best to be objective, and maybe more like a fan. Seriously, enjoying a series is better than being angry, at least for your health. 
(I haven't read LN yet, and I plan to do so shortly. In this review I say only about the anime, in other words, treat it as if it were an original anime like Anohana and Madoka)
I'll focus mainly on story and character.
                  As for the sound, it's pretty decent but I don't find anything really impressive, based on Kajiura Yuki standard. The overall art quality is decent as well, while some scenes fail to convey the sense of hi-tech. Especially the animation of entering SAO, it just feels like 20 century. (Asuna's hair color and CV keep reminding me of Annaru in Anohana, and this similarity somehow ruined my impression on her, as Annaru was drawn, well, badly imo)
OK now let's get started. The first arc focuses more on the relationship (mainly discordance) between the two world, which is evident in many scenes. It's not like ""haha let's accept it and forget it behind"". 
The major complaint I have would be the two side arcs. They are completely unnecessary, and feel rather like fanservice. I'm not saying they are useless, it's just that the producer should use other ways to show his spirit and coolness. 
The character development is also a weak point. I don't feel the MC's development, although I can see the effort that the producer is trying to make watchers think that he has developed. 
The effort is also evident to make the story as reasonable as possible. Unfortunately it's not very successful as well, in both main arcs. Although I can accept it, some people think it as deus ex machina, and I quite understand why they feel that way. At some points I think MC goes too far beyond common sense, and the whole thing seems somehow miraculous. But generally everyone acts fairly consistently. The ending is OK for me. That guy is not essentially bad. 
Finally we come to the romance part, or relationship if you will. I have to admit that it's impossible to be objective on this part. So a good way is to look at the data. According to MAL ranking, more people like this series (and obviously mainly for the romance) than dislike. Personally I like it too. For me their development seems natural. I know this doesn't work for anyone though. 
It gets better in the first episodes in second arc. (Aha good transition) For me, again it doesn't work for everybody, when the girl becomes an ideal figure in his heart, instead of a real person. It's more subtle, and for me, heartfelt. 
*******Spoiler*********
It's sort of ironic to see that how people in VR become real and vice versa
Chasing the girl is almost like chasing the moon for poets
The ending is one of the most natural and demanded happy ending I've ever seen
*******End of Spoiler********
The second arc is also more well organised than the first, with less quasi-filler episodes and characters. That boy feels like a bit, though. 
The introduction of the new character, and the way they interact together are also interesting. Their dialogues seem normal. In similar situations, other shows may make them really unnaturally allusive. 
But when they become closer to the truth, their action began to deviate further and further from common sense. Furthermore, the ending feels even more like deus ex machina. 
The final transition from cyber to reality largely ruins my subtle feeling before. Besides, I can understand that they want to create some space for season II, (and the LN actually contains more than these 2 arcs), but for the anime itself, it really should end there. 
Despite all the complaints I have, I really enjoy this series. I didn't have too much expectation about it and find it pleasant to watch. Don't take as a extremely popular series (sadly it's the fact, but just like I said, it's better for your health)
If I'm being objective then I should probably give it 6 or 7, but it has brought me pleasant time and enjoyment so I give it 8. 
(I've just seen some people saying that it's the best romance since Clannad. Well I sort of have that feeling as well but don't really agree. It's really potential, but the last episode is mediocre)",8

                I just finished watching it ! it was very addictive,
I think it has a great story! it plays in the future and that's what it makes so special ! doesn't everyone fantasize about it how life will be in the future?
You will love this anime if you are really into the action and romantic genres of anime, i think mmo-players will really love this too! it is about a virtual mmo, so that's why..
it was just... AWESOME, the quality is great too and the music matched perfectly :)

                Sword Art Online. I honestly didn't care for this show until my friends on Facebook constantly talked about it alongside AoT and the fact it managed to get a second season was what got me interested. Let me just put it in a simple way for those who want short reviews. This is a fantasy romance/slice of life story not a action filled AoT type show. Short review over.
Long Review:
Story 6/10: At first glance it looks like an awesome action filled anime worth your time judging from the OP alone. Then by episode 4 the hype dies. Due to the lack of budget for the
                  production team there are alot of timeskips present in the first half of the series. Example: Kirito is level 10 in EP1, level 50 in EP2, has legendary items in EP3. Due to the timeskips character development is mostly focused on the two main leads while supporting characters get little to almost no screentime at all. If you were wondering why I said this show fits the slice of life genre is because somewhere in the show Kirito and Asuna spend some time together at a lake house alone. The lake house part last 3 episodes. What happened there? I guess only those who read LN might know.
Art 6/10: Fair enough for an anime of today not really anything to shout about
Sound 7/10: By sound I mean the OP and ED song played in every episode. I quite enjoyed listening to both ED songs. As for the OST played during intense scenes I honestly don't really pay attention to that.
Character 7/10: In the first half there is almost no character development present because of the timeskips save for the lake house part so I was prepared to give it a 6/10 if not for the second half. The second half give more insight on Kirito's family particularly his relationship with his sister.
Enjoyment 6/10: This was a tough one. As a fan of romance/slice of life I enjoyed looking at it as a love story but I am sorely disappointed at the lack action that was promised in the show.
Overall: SAO ends at episode 14. Episode 15 onwards is considered unnecessary and a waste of time unless you're a hardcore romance fan and want to see more Kirito and Asuna.",6
"
                First time reviewing, i'll be short.
I dropped and picked up this anime at least twice. The story has a good concept, the art is great but the rest is...so and so. The episodes were coming too slow most of the time and sometims too boring, which is the first thing that made me keep dropping it and also the main character, Kirito, and his childish behaviour towards the MMOs has been annoying me now and then, mostly on the second half. Also none of the characters is particularly outstanding. In general, I think this show is a bit overrated.
What annoyed me the most is the
                  ending scene. They should definitely have given more screentime and importance to Asuna and not showing Kirito off dancing/flying around with his sister that happens to be in love with him. Asuna that seemed to be the whole 2nd season's cause seemed to be forgotten and overshadowed by the green fairy. Just no,no. It was sorta dissappointing but whatever, curiousity about the story's ending kept me coming back when I had nothing better to watch.",7
"
                When I first watched SAO I never would have guessed how seriously it would try to take itself. Thats not to say that what I watched was bad.... Just that it was flawed and went at it with little to no knowledge of what angle they were taking.
Also this anime isn't very representative of genuine human behavior... Just saying, I don't want to spend my life with someone who I did a dungeon with in World of Warcraft. Nor do I plan on f*cking someone who brings me legendary chicken for dinner.
Story -
 The quality of the story seems to fluctuate... a lot... like.... roller-coaster
                  style. 
Sometimes, the story is really fun, intense. The first few episodes are pretty good, they have everything you need to establish a serious environment. Then it just goes f*cking mental, your main character becomes an emo and now hes fighting Santa Clause.... and i'm just sitting here thinking 'did i miss something?'.
Somewhere along the line, we meet Asuna, who I will go into detail about later. She seems to pick up the plot a bit but after half way through the writers have no idea what to do with her and the story starts going downhill again.
Its very difficult not to spoil anything when writing about the story because anywhere beyond half way through can be considered spoiler territory. So just know that its a bit dodgy here and there, has its moments, its letdowns and its WTF moments but all in all I don't have a problem with the core elements of the story.
Art and Sound -
I don't remember all that much of the sound track, there's nothing that I wanted to add to my playlist that is. Opinions in music is subjective but what I can tell you is that its used well and it does its job of establishing an atmosphere. Same goes for art, where it can. There are no specific quarrels but its not like I had an art exhibition at my finger tips. Although there are some pretty unique, imaginative and beautiful areas that derive from having a fantasy world at your disposal.
Characters -
MMMmmmmkay..... Time to get my Rant hat on.
I have no problem with Kazuto, he can be as emo as he likes whenever he likes. He could be a bit less serious about MMO's every now and then but hey, you're living in a death trap, i'll give you a free pass.
What I have a problem with is Asuna. It seems as if nobody knows what they want her to be. First she's independent and mysterious, then she's strict and commanding then she's dependent and warm then she wants to be 15 and pregnant then she's independent again. Stop. You could argue that this is character development but this sh*t happens in-between episodes. As well as this, they can't decide if they want her to be a heroine or a victim. She's completely passive at one point and then ready to throw down within minutes.
What i'm trying to say on a grander scale is that the relationship that this show is centered around is inconsistent because one of the characters is also inconsistent. Similarly, the relationship is used in so many different ways you can't tell what kind of relationship it is.....
To be totally honest it may even be an illegal one.
Enjoyment - 
My enjoyment was kind of cut short half way through when the show decided to turn in the other direction and start again at episode 1 (except the goofy guy I liked is replaced with some whiny preschool student). But in the end, it was kind of fun. The idea was entertaining to indulge and when the writers got the relationship right it was actually pretty effective.
In Conclusion, watch this if you want something to kill time with, don't expect an award winner, expect to find out where a load of anime memes come from though.",7
"
                I would like to say I am new to anime. I have known anime ever since I was little from my brother. He would always be going out buying tons a of DVDs of anime. I really never got what was so good about it, besides the pretty colors and since it was drawings meaning that they had a larger hold on the ability to capture the writers story. 
But I grew up a bit and realized that it's actually pretty good. And I can honestly say now that I am hooked on it.
This is my first review on this wonderful website. Sword Art isn't
                  the first anime I watched but it was the first anime that really made me want to let my feels on it out there. Not because it was good. Not because it was bad. But because it was both.
* Some Spoilers past here *
The story opens up and you can see the great animation. The vivid colors. And a really nice main character that really just captures you. It was a really good story. But then suddenly turned to romance. I mean they had so much going for it. But Hey, I don't hate romance. So I was like "" What the heck, It's pretty good? "" I loved the show even more after that. It felt so real. The feels get to you and you just play along. But then the second arc comes and just makes you more frustrated. The show loses it's original aura it gave to you. But it's too late to go back now. You've already started it. 
Second Season comes and it jusst becomes slice of life. I was so disappoint.
8/10- It was so good. Had so much potential. Then it just broke down. I hope Season 3 gets better.",8
"
                Now, a lot of people might just watch the score of 10 i have given this show and ignore this review. Keep this in mind, i watched this anime in december 2012, you know, before all of this ""SAO is SHIT"" bullsh*t took place.
Before i give the actual review, let's see why this anime is hated so much.
Sword Art Online is not hated because it is bad, because it is not bad at all, the reason it is hated is because it is overrated as hell. This, in my opinion, is the most overrated anime ever. However, just because it is overrated doesn't mean that
                  it is bad.
Now the review:
Sword Art Online, season 1, can be mainly divided into 2 arcs, Sword Art Online and Alfheim Online arcs. The anime begins showing us a futuristic world where the first virtual MMORPG, Sword Art Online has been successfully created. Kirito, the main character, was one of the beta testers of the game and therefore knows his way around the game. The game mainly consists of a dungeon sort of place called Aincrad which contains a hundred floors. At first everything seems to be fun and all but by the end of the first episode it is revealed that the players cannot log out of the game and the only way to escape is to beat the game, clear the hundred floors. Also, if anyone dies in this game, they die in real life.
This arc lasts for upto 12 episodes. Then is the Alfheim Online arc, telling whose plot might spoil the first arc.
The story is kind of ok, it is about how Kirito meets other players, among whom is his romantic partner Asuna, how they struggle to advance to the upper levels of Aincrad. 
The good things about the anime are its animation, its soundtrack and its enjoyment factor.
There is no major character development. The mc is an overpowered Gary Stu named Kirito, who happens to be an expert in virtual sword fighting. The pattern for the female characters kind of keeps on repeating, they are kawaii little girls who meet Kirito some way or the other and somehow fall in love with him.
Mind you, the overall rating is not based on character development or art or sound but is solely based on the enjoyment factor.
All in all, SAO is pretty enjoyable but if you care a lot about character development, story and whatnot, it might not be your cup of tea.",10
"
                What does SAO mean? I think the word that best defines it is... disappointment. After setting an original plot during its early chapters, it seemed that we would be able to see a good picture of what successful MMO games are into an anime, with their amazing bosses and enormous maps, something that, in fact, is achieved in the early chapters.
Also, SAO added an interesting factor, death, turning everything into something more than a game. The target was no longer having fun, they had to win and survive, and that introduced dilemmas and situations that were beyond the game. Some people just tried to survive,
                  others did whatever they could to win, either teaming up or betraying other players. A virtual reality game had become, suddenly, a life simulator, with such a simple and yet so important detail as death.
I liked the idea, there's no doubt, but everything changed when they decided to forget what, at first, looked like the anime target, or what I thought the target would be. In a few chapters everything became different, chapters went through a romantic plot between the main character and the gamer girls he encountered, helping them like a perfectly good blue prince, and forming, step by step, his harem. Female characters who could have excelled were brought down into housewives (ehem... Asuna... ehem), romantic comedy overtones everywhere and, as time was going by, a worryingly descendant presence of action scenes or details that reminded you that everything was part of a game (even the protagonists forget it), and I would like not to talk about the second part of the anime, fairies...
In conclusion, the good ideas that made me being interested in the anime became nothing, a really misused context which ended up telling a love story which, also, has nothing special, a hero who saves the troubled girl, nothing new. SAO has been, with no doubt, one of the great disappointments that anime has given me.",3
"
I'll take a jab on one of the most hated/loved animes I've seen here in MAL.
1st Arc: 9  / 2nd Arc: 7
My Overall Score: 8
My thoughts on the 1st Arc :
- It had a very interesting plot. Since I have not watched any other anime with a virtual reality theme, there is nothing to compare it to.-  Animation/Art was beautiful
- I loved Kirito and Asuna. The supporting characters were just alright. Every girl in the virtual world had a thing for Kirito-kun and I kinda get it. Evil players were downright evil. I was like hating them as well.
- Dramatic scenes got me -- I almost cried in some parts (almost!)
- OP and ED songs were fantastic! Downloaded them in no time at all
- It ended abruptly and I was not expecting it...
My thoughts on the 2nd Arc:
- After 2 or 3 episodes in this Arc, I was like ""HUH?! What the hell is happening!?""
- Too many fan service involving Sugu
- Irksome relationship between Kazuto/Kirito and Sugu
- Still loved the OP and ED songs
- I was satisfied with the last fight scene though it did not have the same effect as the one in the 1st Arc
All in all, I enjoyed watching SAO. I wish they just made 2 seasons instead of cutting it into arcs. I wanted more of the 'when you die in the game, you die in reality' feel to it. It was more suspenseful to watch (wishing no one else dies, of course!). 
The ending does not have the ""wow!"" or ""awww"" factor for me but I think they made the most of it.",8
"
                Man, Sword Art Online is the best. The dying, the living, the non-existing plane of existence that drives us all to succeed, and especially the girls. These girls all have such a hard on for the main character that it's unbelievable. And it's only because Kirito can use a sword. I can use a sword, but when I try to save a girl, she screams at me for killing her boyfriend. But I ask you, did you enjoy this anime?

                Hello Everyone, Caz here with an anime review.
SAO to me is neither the worst thing created nor the best, instead it is stuck in the valley of almost brilliant but not there yet.
The story is very good for the first part of the first season, with plenty of motivation from the surroundings to create and let you become attached to some of the characters, though this peters out towards the end of the first season and it becomes quite ordinary in the second half, with much of the threat of death gone and the objective being better for a single episode than a whole twelve.
Of
                  course the art, and so the action, are good, but shiny and fluid visuals only lend to a third of the anime, if that. Still, the landscapes are very colorful and pleasant to look at, which makes me happy they chose a video game environment as I feel that this can give the artists more liberty with howthey construct areas.
The characters feel good at the start because you can feel all the potential they have, all the chances they have, especially in there situation they have been placed in, to become truly great. Sadly, this potential is wasted as all the main characters can be placed into boxes before long into the series (~6/7) and the chemistry between some are somewhat forced in some cases.However, the villain of the second half served his purpose very well as i really loved to hate him.
When I first watched this anime, I found myself getting really into it. But now that I have the benefit of hindsight, I can barely remember any of the scenes and those I do are either because I hated a character so much I was shouting at my screen for them to be deus-ex-machina'd or because I am a sucker for fluff, no matter how forced.",7
"
                Being the heavy gamer that I am, It was hard to resist Sword Art Online: where thousands are trapped inside of an Virtual Reality MMORPG. Not only do they have to make it through 100 floors to escape this death game; if they die in the game, they die in real life
Story:
Even though many other animes have used the trope of people being trapped inside of a video game, I feel like SAO put its own creative twist on it. The events that unravel while Kirito and his party try to escape add a unique set of challenges. In addition, the way the relationship between
                  Kirito and Asuna unfolds was just so realistic its hard not to not hate it. Even for a trope of a plot, SAO manages to make a few good stops along the way.
Art:
The over art to Sword Art Online was more or less average. Theres nothing particularly incredible about the art that really stood out, both in the art style and animation. Even the designs of characters, monsters, and locations just seemed like your average fantasy RPG setting and whatnot. That could have been what they were going for; like a 'This is familiar because Ive played Final Fantasy sort of way' which is understandable. It would have been nice to see a city or a boss monster that really caught my attention.
Sound:
Well being of a better quality than the art, the sound in SAO wasnt anything near amazing, but I did have a great OST, a lot of which managed to get me nostalgic, reminding me of my old school RPG days. The english voice cast fit the characters rather well, and included some of my favorite voice actors.
Character:
Im a bit torn about the characters in SAO, mostly because Kirito isnt an amazing main character, but on the other half of the spectrum, Asuna manages to become a greater character as the series goes on. Kiritos worst problem manages to be his straight up OPness. Theres almost nothing in the world of SAO he cannot do. He is also under the firm belief that he overcome any obstacle (which he can) but his cockiness gets old fast. However, he does put the breaks on sometimes, especially when it comes to Asuna. For anime heroines, Asuna stands among the best, she manages to be so realistic and believable, but has a firm stance on what she believes in. The greatest reason for her standing out so strong lies in her character design however. She is such a beautiful character, but lacks an hourglass figure and a skimpy outfit, which every anime feels like it needs. The side characters make up for most everything. Even though they were all enjoyable I felt that none of them really seemed to stand out too much, but a few strong characters are better many plain ones.
Enjoyment:
Sword Art Online is easy to watch, easy to get into, and has a smooth flow all the way through it. Fun characters and a looming threat make it easy to keep interest and transitions from episode to episode are smooth, with little in the way of content being missed. 
Overall:
Raking in a solid 7/10 Sword Art Online, doesnt manage to stand out in any particular field, but it does hold strong in all areas and not make any mistakes along the way. If your looking for a solid story with a fun cast of characters and some epic fight scenes, definitely check out SAO.
*Favorite Character:
This one goes to Lizabeth the blacksmith for several reasons. She is voiced by Sarah Anne Williams, one of my voice talents. I tend to not be big on the abrasive tsundere type, but she just did it for me. Blacksmithing is also something Im fond of in fantasy settings, so her being of the best just gave her more points. Her few episodes that she spends with Kirito also manage to be some of the best in the show.",7
"
                It was the last day of our spring break, the weather was depressing and I was mindlessly looking at 9gag, smirking at the posts. Not much was going on as I saw a post showing a black clad swordsman and a brightly dressed woman. I was intrigued, so I looked it up and found SAO,at that moment my journey into the world of anime begun and now almost half a year later I am here writing this review.
You all know what the story is about but lets look at it again. In the near future they manage to create a full virtual reality MMORPG in
                  which a bunch of people get trapped. To get out they have to complete the game, but if they die in-game they really die in real life. We are presented the main character Kirito who is one of the people trapped in this game, he is in a better position than the majority as he was part of the beta testers. He becomes very good, joins the lead group, falls in love with Yuuki Asuna, makes a lot of friends and a personal harem,… 
Well the story itself is quite interesting, but the problem is that it tries to tackle too much in it’s two story arcs of the first season. The first arc depicts the time of about two years and so we only get to see a very small fraction of that time. Because of that we encounter huge leaps in time in which we have little to no insight. I goes to show it is an adaptation of a extensive light novel. The anime also seems like it wants to tackle several different genres and jumps around from one to another. This lac of direction means that there is precious time spent on things that could have been left out. On the other hand this brings a sense of uniqueness to SAO as I have yet to see an anime that includes such diversity in subjects. That might be one of the reasons for SAOs popularity as most people can enjoy at least one of these segments in the story. The game aspect of the anime was in my opinion very well done, but I am not a big fan of MMORPG’s so I am not qualified to judge that aspect.
That brings us to the second arc in the first season which many claim is much worse than the first one and I have to partially agree, as did not find is as entertaining as the first. The story focuses more on relationships between characters and the aftermaths of the first arc and in my opinion occasionally moves a little to slowly. All in all I found the story interesting, and while I stand more on the side of the fans defending SAO I can understand why some people might dislike it.
Our main character Kirito is just your stereotypical hero, strong, brave, honourable and good looking. I have heard some people criticise this, but I don’t mind it, because even if he is a bit one-dimensional, he still manages to be memorable and he still gets his fair share of development throughout the sereies. Next we have his soulmate Yuuki Asuna who is portrayed as a very skilled and independent woman. We can see her and Kirito slowly fall in love through the first couple of episodes and I have to say I found this pretty darn beautiful if a bit rushed. Her attitude changes severely in the second half, but her position was changed as well so I have to say I did not mind it. The second part introduces another important character, KIrito’s sister Suguha, not to spoil the second half I will only say that she is a decent character, but with her comes one of the worst aspects of the anime, wannabe incest. There are plenty of peasant side character that bring a bit of diversity into the story and brig several memorable moments to the show. The antagonists are both disappointing, as the first one while interesting never gets explored enough for us to know his motives, while the second one is just pitiful. 
The visuals are just superb, the backdrops look beautiful and the characters are instantly recognisable and relatively unique. The battle sequences have this flow that really makes it look as if it was a video game and that greatly helps establishing the feeling that we are watching people trapped in a virtual reality game. The visuals in the second part only improve and I would have to say that this anime features one of the best animations I have ever seen.The soundtrack to the show is masterfully done and fits it perfectly. The openings and endings are all great, even if I prefer the ones from the second season to these, but they did not bother me and I have to say I never felt the urge to skip them as I was watching.
I don’t understand why people bash SAO so much, I admit it is no masterpiece, but it is very easily accessible, caters to a large audience and actually manages to please most of its viewers. As for my score I have to say that it realistically deserves an eight, but as the anime that started it all for me, I believe it deserves an extra point. I think this is a great anime to get a friend into anime as it is quite easy for them to find something they like and they have a it is easy for them to pick a theme they like and then look up more anime of that genre.
As I am still new to reviewing all feedback is greatly appreciated.",9

                Maybe one spoiler or something, in case you are concerned with that.
Perks: Artwork, Music, Premise, Enjoyable
Quirks: Character Development, Transitions, Filler, Story Focus, First 'Arc' Resolution, Character Process
A friend told me that, while listed as one season, SAO is technically 'two' or at least contains two large plot arcs, coupled together. Since I've seen up through the first, I'll write one review here, and then another once I've finished the entire show.
When I first heard the words 'Sword Art Online', I thought of an Epic Mickey game played on a tablet; I thought it'd be about painting because, well, hey, 'art' is in the title. Then
                  it was clarified. While a child, I loved .hack//SIGN's premise, and I like MMO stories, so I thought to give it a try.
Well, let's start with the easiest.
Art: 9
I don't have many complaints here. Maybe to an anime connoisseur this art isn't that special, but I liked it, particularly the background art. In fact, I'd probably score the background a point or two above character art. It was beautiful, and I thought a lot of going out into forests and cabins in my youth. I feel like this definitely captured the sense of a fantastical place; the setting didn't distract by being too exaggerated and intensive, but from what I remember of the few minutes in 'the real world' it's shinier, pretty, more enchanting. The character art fits in well, but it's less stellar than the backgrounds, so I'm not quite as impressed by it.
Sound: 9
Since Yuki Kajiura did the music, and I absolutely loved her work in Madoka and .hack, I'm biased to highly rating it in this department too. It definitely captures the fantasy elements of this world; it's ethereal, like stumbling through a portal into a mosaic. However, at some parts I didn't really notice it, so I won't give a perfect ten, and, like I said, it's biased already.
Story: 6
I'd give it a 5.5 if I could, but I can't. This feels grossly inflated as it is. So, obviously, the premise is interesting; the first episode drew me in, and I thought, wow, all of these people trapped, dying, etc, that's going to be interesting to see. However, that's the issue: you don't see. I've seen other reviewers mention the problems with the fateful tag 'X Number Dead' starting this episode or that. Now, realistically, is it possible to show so many people dying? No, but throwing out a number like that makes it somewhat more desensitized. You have a minor shock/gasp, but it's a cheap one, because you're supposed to think 'Wow, so many people died; how terrible!'. As these episodes pressed on, I felt like I never really understood what that meant, what that tragic number really signified. I don't know how the characters felt about it; from what I remember they mentioned it here and there, but short of Kirito's personal experiences seeing guild members die, there wasn't much tension here, and even during these deaths I felt like it was more of the typical-main-character-messes-up-and-then-has-to-feel-sorry vibe than it was legitimate emotion. 
I think too, that having 100 floors is a number that is set up to doom itself. In so short a series, there is no way to show most of that. Obviously, it'd get repetitive to see Kirito fight on every floor, in every dungeon, but these massive leaps in progress make it feel like we're not seeing him progress at all. Other than leveling up and acquiring new items, do we really see Kirito improve? I feel like he was always damn awesome at the game; from the very beginning, he knew his stuff, and at the end he knows it too. So what did his journey teach him, minus to not rush into battle/lie on his level? I feel like doing less, but doing more with it, would have made this more successful. I mean, to say there're so many levels and then to show us very little, kills that excitement we started the show with.
Next, the episodes themselves. Even though I can pull out something at least somewhat useful to plot in every episode, I feel like so much was filler. If the game will be completed in 14 episodes, then focus on the game and on the main story; there isn't time to focus so much on getting this item or meeting this person or doing this special event if it doesn't tie in to the main plot. I actually don't mind filler episodes, but when it's less of an interruption in plot and more of consuming of episode numbers in place of important storyline, it detracts severely from the show.
Lastly, the battle with the creator of the game. Our hero Kirito needed to train to get up through over 70 levels, or he wouldn't have been good enough -probably, but seeing how he's a godsend who knows- to take on the 'final boss'. However, by making them fight nowhere near the 100th level, I suppose we do receive a minor plot twist, but this, for me at least, took away from the point of getting up that far. It almost felt as if the plot got tired and wanted to be resolved more quickly. More than this, the creator's reasons for what he did, which were mostly 'idk lol I just did', were beyond shallow. He supposedly killed many people, and for what? He doesn't know. He just felt like it. I don't understand a motive like that. Not every story needs a cliche supervillain, but this just seemed like the writers didn't have an idea, and didn't care.
Character: 6
Although I liked the characters, none of them felt particularly striking in terms of anime characters in general. A lot are tropes, and most we only see for an episode or a few at least, so they aren't developed. I like Kirito, and I like Miss Asuna too, and I actually felt like their relationship worked, because they were both on similar pages. I don't think I really know Kirito very well, and sometimes that's fine, because I appreciate not having a character resume thrown at me and having all aspects of their personality defined. But with him, I can't place much of any understanding to his character. He seems like a nice guy, but he's oddly aloof, and at times I don't really get why he is. He definitely cares about people, as we see with Asuna and some of the later characters, but I feel like he definitely needs more development; much of the plot seems to kind of bounce off of him as if he's a wall. In summation, I don't really have an issue with the characters, but they're not developed enough for me to give them above average.
Enjoyment: 8
I'd probably had gone with a 7.5, but whatever. I feel like the transitions, focus of individual episodes, and lack of character development may frustrate some viewers, but overall I still liked watching this show, and I feel like most people would enjoy it. If you're looking for a work of art in terms of plot and character, probably not the place to look, but it's definitely good escapist anime, and I never felt the problems would keep me from finishing it. There might be better virtual world anime out there, but this one's still a fun ride, and if you're into this genre, I think you'd like it.
Overall: For the reasons stated above, a 7. It's enough to keep me watching the second part.",7
"
                I think is anime is outstanding, cuz when I first watched episode 1-3, then my whole mind got lost in that anime.
To me this anime is something that can cheer you up.
The first thing that got me to like this anime, was Kirito and Asuna, their love is outstanding strong, but not only that, then Kirito and Asuna is like one of the characters i mostly like, and don't ask me why, I just like them xD
If you like Romance and Action, then this is for you. Love is strong in this anime. Action is there all the time, and it reminds you somehow of
                  how the world is now at days, but if you watch it, then you will think that our world is some BS
Hope you find this review useful.",10
"
                For me, this anime has been underrated for things such as; the story line is too fast or skipped; the characters are unrealistic or too good to be true; the story lacks something; things like that has been said by other reviews...
But for me, It's the OTHER WAY AROUND
I think liking an anime depends on you. It must be that you wanted a situation to happen in the anime but it didn't... We'll it did happened to me at a certain point BUT as you watch the anime carefully, you will be able to notice its strengths too. Strengths like the anime depicts the values
                  of love, friendship, bravery, honor and justice.
Watching the first episode made me think THIS IS AN INTERESTING anime. Well, it really was. At the second episode or more, you would be wondering 'What happened? did i skipped some episodes?' To answer your question, you didn't. Actually it was a bit disappointment for the fast pacing but you can't do something about it. 
IF YOU HAVE READ THE S.A.O. NOVEL, you can get what i am saying... (the anime just does what is describe at the novel. try to read the novel too.. It is great!) :D
Honestly, KEEP WATCHING the anime and i promise you will get to like it. I ended up watching the anime NON-STOP haha! When i finished watching the anime, I ended WANTING FOR MORE! As a result of that, i read the novel version of SAO. It was really my first time reading a full text page just from watching this anime. 
IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING!
So guys, don't rely too much in other information because you will never get to know if you really like this anime or not without TRYING TO WATCH IT YOURSELF. 
I hope this review will be helpful :D",9
"
                This anime had an amazing start! I really enjoyed it until they started turning it into harem.. I HATE it for that romance bit which only ruined the whole plot. Stupid little girls fighting over one boy... -.-
Story: 7/10
As I said before, the whole anime interested me and I loved it. But unfortunatelly everything was ruined by that teenage love.
Art: 10/10
Art was just beautiful! I don't know what else to say.
Sound: 10/10
EEEEPIIIC!!!!
Character: 4/10
The characters could have been improved so much better than they were. The girls annoyed me, especially Asuna.
Enoyment: 3/10
I stopped watching it for a very long time because the anime simply disgusted me.",2
"
                I feel that SAO is a very difficult anime to review, simply due to its popularity and the argument over its “greatness” and eventual “destruction” I will only be reviewing SAO not SAO II. 
Instead of scoring this like many other reviews with numbers for each category, I will just talk about the different aspects of the show and what I liked/disliked.
The Setting:
	One of the most unique settings in anime. Ever since this anime came out, I have always gotten the impression that we are waiting for the next MOP anime to come out with as great of a setting. In the first half of
                  the series we had your typical MOP game with swords, parties, and money. What made everything so interesting though was the fact that if you die, you die in real life. The second half of the series also did a nice job showing such an amazing and interesting world.					Yet I think the creators’ eyes were bigger than their stomachs, particularly with SAO. There were so many interesting aspects to explore: The Bosses, Party relationships, Character Interactions, and I felt that the show simply didn’t explore enough of the world.
The Plot:
	The Plot also has some pretty major positives and negatives. The negatives definitely came in the first half BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS RUSHED!!! Like the setting, the plot wasn’t developed enough. There were inconsistent time jumps and overall I never felt like I could connect with the characters. It was like reading a news article about a war and the nearby civilians. Sure, you understand why a character loves/hates another character but you don’t necessarily have emotions for them. When someone dies the emotions just aren’t there because you have only seen this character for one episode, yet Kirito might have been with this person for 3 months so of course he feels sad.			
	To make matters worse, there were a lot of filler episodes in the first half of the show. I felt like the show lost sense of where the final goal was. Yet, in the second half of the show with AOL everything gets fixed. The characters are consistently moving toward a goal. I can begin to feel for them. Also, there is an antagonist that truly feels like an antagonist. So through these points regard, the show improved heading into the second half of the season. This definitely gave me a more positive impression of the show. 
Characters:
	A weak part of the show. Kirito simply was so OP at times that it didn’t make sense. While his emotions make sense throughout, due to the plot issue mentioned previously, I never felt that I could connect with him. Asuna was sweet. Yet, ultimately she wasn’t anything special. Yui definitely kind of creeped me out with her personality switch between seeming like a child and an adult. I loved Suguha. She was well developed in the second half and her interactions with Kirito were fantastic. The side characters were simply kind of there. Overall, nothing truly special. Nothing was awful, but I definitely would call the characters sub-par. 
Music:
	It was pretty good. The First OP was great. The second one above average. The endings were so-so with the second one being better. The OST was also great, but I didn’t hear much variety. Not really much to say, the music is above average. 
Sound:
	I am giving this a different category from music. Here I am referring to the sounds of the show, particularly the sword battles. While I wouldn’t say that the sword sounds were 100% accurate, I will say that the timing and amount of sound was spectacular. I think this part of the anime goes underappreciated. The sword clings, during battle were spectacular and if you watch the show, please pay attention because it is fantastic!
Visuals:
	Crisp, Clean, Bright, and Colorful…just the way I like it. The animation was stellar and fluid. 
Overall:
	This show is something of a mixed bag for me. On one hand, the show doesn’t develop its plot or characters well enough. Yet on the other hand, the setting and improvement over the second half make up for it. However, good or bad, this show was definitely fun and I really enjoyed it so give it a try even if you have heard bad things about the show. 
P.S. There is a massive plot hole with Asuna at the end of the first arc. If anyone wants to discuss it or clarify the plot hole, please message me. Hope my review was helpful :D",7

                I'm going to preface this with the fact that I think the premise of this show has vast potential. The show however squanders every opportunity to make a decent show about being trapped in a video game.  My loathing of this show can be summarized pretty quickly, so I won't waste my time writing an extremely in-depth review. 
Aside from the art and music, which I will admit are really good, this show fails in some of the most important things a show needs, good characters and a good story. This kind of show should be driven by it's characters as they work their
                  way through the mysteries of this world or how they interact with the world and people they've been trapped with. Character's should grow through their experiences and make the viewer care about them. 
Sword Art Online fails in all of these areas. The first mistake this show makes is Kirito, the main protagonist and edge-lord supreme. Mister Only-Wears-Black Cloaks over here fails to be anything close to a likable character, being an gloomy lone wolf at his best and a misogynist at his worst. His character never really changes throughout the series, maintaining his ""I work alone."" mentality for the majority of the first half of the series until dramatic character change between him and Asuna which primarily sprung within two episodes. (Yes, it's obvious they were going to get together from the get go but at least put effort into it. Not mention it was extremely out of character for her.) 
Another problem with this show is the constant time jumps. You cannot be connected to a character if you cannot empathize with their experiences. And the majority of their experiences in this show happen off screen, in bits and pieces of story that the show just skips over. We never get to see them get stronger, we don't get to watch the climb the tower and bask in their victory. It happens off screen and we're left watching them in the aftermath of events. 
Do important things happen on screen...yes. But these events have little to no tension to them, because we know what's going to happen. Kirito comes in and saves the day because he's OP as shit do to training and events we haven't seen at all. And when other people die in this show it leaves little to no impact because most of the characters we see show up maybe once or twice, and after their primary episode are left with maybe a minute of screen time for the rest of the series. 
Maybe I wouldn't have a huge problem with Kirito and the other characters if it even seemed like the other characters existed. They are all flat archetypes of characters who are really just their to sing Kirito's praises. You've got your comedic best friend, shy girl who gets picked on, tsundere waifu, sad girl who's obviously going to die because she's sad. Oh, and if you're a male chacter you probably just shouldn't show up because the show doesn't give a shit you exist unless you have exposition or need to fight something. 
Speaking of fighting ever notice how if you're a a good fighter and you're fighting some creature, you'll do pretty well against it...until Kirito shows up. Then you get a case of the spaghooter legs and forget how to hold your damn sword until Kirito mops up the rest of the bad guys (You are 1000X times as likely to have this happen to you if you are female, named Asuna, and are stuck in a cage.)
I've now currently wasted way more time than I wanted to with this review. Overall this show gets a 2/10 from me (only because I think some of the fight scenes are well animated). Trash, and not even the enjoyable kind.
P.S. Ever notice how dragon girl in the first half of the show is essentially a younger Asuna...because you know we needed the Loli fanservice.",2
"
                I seriously dont even know where do begin with this anime. But obviously its my favorite and I have reasons why I do and why I dont like it.
I guess I'll start with the story. Me being an avid gamer of 16 years and also an otaku for a little less than that, I think its safe to say I jumped on this anime as soon as I heard about it in 2012. An anime about MMORPGs. What more could I ask for? 
The story is over all a 10 for me automatically because I just simply am a sucker for love stories and at
                  the same time I HATE them. But SAO really brought it upon me to not be able to tear myself away from the series because of my instant love for the story which leads me into the characters.
Kirito - My opinion of Kirito was obviously heart-eyes all the way through the series. As Kirito found himself throughout the game and learned along with everyone else that shits literally about to get real, and that it was time to really strive to live through this game no matter how long it took, even if it took being a solo player, given that he was the greatest solo player in the game. Until he met the one person who really amplified who he was and how far he could get through the game. Which leads me to Asuna.
Asuna - At first you meet Asuna in the first town with only a cloak, which doesnt really say much. Shes just.. there. Once the story progresses to the first boss, thats when Asuna really shines and everyone sees who she truly is and actually pays attention, especially Kirito. I was really disappointed in the fact that Asuna just cooks the who damn first part of the show. Yeah her ass is in the kitchen getting 500/500 maxed cooking skill while Kirito is doing all the work. While Asuna is one of my favorite characters, she isnt a 10/10 character. Although her weapon IS my favorite. Her Lambent light rapier is a bright turquoise blue with white accents and a blue gem on each side. I, personally, enjoy speed and movement over attack in mostly anything, and the rapier is exactly that.  
Yui -  ""The artificial intelligence"" more like the artificial gtfo. I absolutely could NOT stand Yui. She wasnt a help to anything except to my annoyance. Kirito and Asuna are literally 15-16 years old and the writers literally ""gave"" them a child in this hell game. One of my favorite parts in the series is when Kirito and Asuna go on their little trip to the cabin and I thought it was just downright adorable and perfect in every way. Then they had to drop a damn kid in the story and basically ruin everything. I really cant wrap my head around why everyone went nuts over this character, maybe its because they overly tried to make her cute and I just shut down to that idea. Or maybe its the fact I hate kids. Who knows. But if I could give negative scores on characters..
Klein - I actually enjoyed Klein's character in the beginning of the series. He was witty and silly and one of the cutest males in the story. But thats just it. The BEGINNING of the series and ONLY that. He literally got pushed aside after the first episode and they just sacked him off with another guild after Kirito and him had their hilarious little banter calling each other cute. I really wish I could rate Klein but I cant say I can because of his absence throughout the whole anime.
Silica - I really enjoyed the fact that there was ACTUALLY a beast tamer in the series. The only classes that were ever shown were basically swordsman. YES I know its called SWORD art online, but when they introduced Sil it really surprised me and it got me excited to see other weapons and classes in the game. But Silica, much like Yui annoyed me as well. Of course they made her infatuated with Kirito, because well, who isnt. But the fact at one part of the show where they angled her.. just...so.. I dont know. She was half naked at one part and bent over a table at another part. Shes supposed to be 12 and she ages through the arcs but I dont believe shes ACTUALLY 12. She acts and looks younger than that. But its not like Japanese writers say ""Lets have all the females of this anime fully clothed without a sex drive"" I can never understand Japan writers, as much as I want to. 
Liz - It was really refreshing to see someone that wasnt in a particular class. Lizbeth is a blacksmith. She's all happy and fun and has a bit of a temper when she almost strangled Kirito to death when he broke her sword. But hey, it was an accident. But here it comes, SPOILER ALERT, she wants to bang Kirito too. But on the other hand she doesnt let her feelings get in the way. She's the best friend to Asuna first before she's a secret admirer of Kirito and I was happy that the writers wrote in that respect and I really enjoyed Asuna having a close friend in the game.
Agil -  He's a small character role in the series but obviously I enjoyed him enough to review him. He's a friendly player that runs a merchant shop and gives Kirito a place to stay and also helps lower level players when he can. He really doesnt metion anything about his background other than the fact that he is African-American but he lives in Japan. He has a wife and she ran his shop during his absence, but thats really about it. I would have really liked to know more of his story or at least had him in the show a little more than than usual.
The sound was obviously good. The effects and the music were spot on, nothing was really out of place for me.
My enjoyment for the anime was somewhere around a 9.5 or a 10. The characters I DID get to know were outstandingly stunning. But some of the characters just got pushed aside and were never touched on again. The anime could have been longer but the ALFheim arc really didnt cover it for me.
Overall it is by far my FAVORITE anime. It would be perfect if it had some blood and a little bit of gore in it. (but thats just me and I'm a freak about that stuff.) I understand that its really blown up since its release in 2012, but what I dont understand is the same amount of people that like it are the same amount of people that hate it. Some animes arent for certain people and thats perfectly fine. But this anime was for me and it was meant for me and everything listed above is why it's going to stay that way.",10
"
                Before I start this review, all things I say are based entirely on OPINION. None of the things I say are FACTS, so please, keep your own opinions inside of yourself. If I have convinced you one bit to watch a series, that's okay. With that in mind, let's start.
Okay, after ""attempting"" to rewatch this anime to question myself why I gave it a 9, I realized that it isn't as great as my past self thought it was. I made the review around the start of the year, and Sword Art Online was probably one of the first anime I watched. But... I couldn't
                  really bear watching past episode 5... again.
Sword Art Online would of been an okay series, but after episode 2 things start to pace a little too fast. Episode 1 and 2 were great episodes, but past that, the whole series wasn't that good. The Aincrad part was okay... but the second half, ALfhiem? Yuck. I'd never watch that ever again.
The ALfheim arc is one of the worst arcs in Anime history. There may be worse ones, but I absolutely hate the ALfheim arc, and I'm not going to explain why. And, you know what? Why not let's have it again... in the frikkin' second season?! I'm pretty sure that's a good idea... yuck.
The story is probably the worst part about this series, I reckon any 7-year old kid can think of this story. A bunch of players are stuck inside a game... and they need to escape, that's the first arc story. Literally. That. Is. It. 
The story of the second arc, Fairy Dance arc, is that Asuna is trapped inside of ALfheim... and then Kirito goes to save her. The story sounds good, yes, but... it's not. This arc happens to be one of the most dreadful, horrible, worst arcs in anime history. I may be exaggerating when I say that, but, again, opinions, man, opinions. The story for the overall series, I'd say, is... yuck.
The art style is one of the more better things about the series, being actually pretty good. But, I don't have much other things to actually say about the art style and animation, just that it's pretty good. That's all I have to say about it, I'm not gonna explain with 84 paragraphs of why the art style is good.
The music to the anime series is okay, but it's not that good. It's almost in the middle, being a bit above the middle, so it's good, I'd say. The opening to the Aincrad arc, it's okay, the opening to the Fairy Dance arc, again, okay... the background music played, don't remember it considering... Been almost a year since I've watched this.
The characters in the series, from which, I do not like many of them. I only like the main character, Kirito, because, the other characters seemed rushed? I don't know. I don't know. Help. This series... it hurts.
So, overall, I'd give the series a 3/10. You think that's a bad score? Nah. I was being generous. People give this anime 1 and 2's. If they could, some people would probably give this anime a 0. I'm not lying, people probably would.
So, why'd I change my mind from recently giving this anime a 9? I had no idea what a good anime series was back then, but after watching several series like Monster, Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, I realized that a 7 year old could think of this story, when in Hunter x Hunter, that story is so detailed, I think of the mangaka as the most imaginative person in this universe. I couldn't think of that awesome story... in like... 20 years.",3
"
                Ok... This is the first review I've done so please don't be too judgmental. Alright Here goes.
When I think of how Sword Art Online (SAO) was, the thing that comes to mind is that it was...well...okay at best really. You get the basic rundown of a player of a large scale VRMMORPG that requires high-tech to use, to later find out that this game is not your average computer game. Its a game of Life or Death. Clear the 100 floors in SAO to escape the game but if you die there you die in real life. And I like that concept. But no anime
                  is without its flaws. In this case a lot of flaws...
Story: 3 out of 10
The story in my opinion was good to begin with as it gave me the impression that it would be a good action filled anime with plenty of plot development, but boy was I wrong. I feel as if it was rushed as in a lot of parts. You see the main character 'Kirito' go to different areas of the game and skips through many months throughout the first few episodes. The story of SAO goes from bad to worse because it jumps away from the main plot to go more in-depth about Kirito and the second main character 'Asuna Yuuki'. A Crappy and boring romance that seemed forced and 'too perfect'. I mean come on -.-.
But as soon as the 2nd season starts, that's where everything goes even more downhill. During this time a completely new concept is added from a Survival Mission to a Rescue Mission which is just really silly because they moved away from the main reason behind the anime.
Yet another love interest for Kirito shows up making this seem like something that was just not needed at all for the plot at all and got me a bit annoyed.

Now then away from the negatives for a bit. The art work of SAO is very well done. Each of the character's features (such as facial features and costumes) and backgrounds are well done. That's one of the main things that drew me towards this anime after it was recommended to me.
Sound: 8 out of 10
Ok the OSTs of this anime are amazing. Especially the openings: Crossing Field and Innocence. Each track that was used in the anime were well inserted and since they were used in the right place it gave it a higher overall effectiveness depending on the situation at hand.
Character: 2 out of 10
Alright here is one of the main problems here for me. The character use. I like the variety of characters used in SAO but its what happens to them and what they do that bugs me the most. Problem One: You have Kirito; the main guy who is meant to be in every episode but is overpowered in every sense even defying the game physics (how the hell does one do that?) and is a fricken chick magnet which has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever.
Problem Two: Asuna. She is meant to be the second main character in SAO but instead of fulfilling that role she is seen as more of a meat shield for Kirito. The only times she seems to really shine is when Kirito is in danger or when she cooks (do people in a game really need to eat?). Thats about it. A typical and annoying Tsundere. Nothing more to be said here.
Problem Three: Other Female Characters. I'm not even joking about this. They are given a role for like 1 or 2 episodes and are then forgotten about. They may do something for Kirito or Kirito does something for them. And they all seem to have a thing for Kirito as soon as they see him. They always seemed to get embarrassed when he smiles at them or typical things like that. But even so after seeing this, this kinda got me thinking that this had a bit of a Harem element inside of it, which again just wasn't needed at all. Because of this I feel that each of the female characters aren't developed much at all because of how they are just ignored.
Enjoyment: 6 out of 10
This anime may have had its flaws but I still enjoyed watching it. Its just that the whole 'harem' kinda thing was kind of annoying as it had nothing to do with the plot and was pretty much a waste of time. The boss fights were pretty cool and flashy and kind of memorable in a sense, It had its funny parts, sad parts, and 'what the hell' moments. But yea I enjoyed this anime.
Overall: 5 of out 10
Again it had quite a lot flaws but the battle scenes kind of lifted this up a bit but not by much. Honestly, SAO is hugely overrated. Would I recommend this? Only to those who could look past the many plot holes this anime has just for the enjoyment, if they find any.
Well if you're here that means you read all of my review. Thanks for taking your time to read this :D",6

                Ok so basically I created my account here just to add a review about this anime ... I mean I'm just so frustrated after wasting my time on first ten episodes :/ Now I'm dropping this ... Its the worst anime I ever watched I can't understand why it is so famous ...
spoilers ahead:
Ok first & the most important thing is there is no character development, no background story, only first episode was ok they crossed level 1 and the fight was ok and then In second episode we see that the main character just skipped to level 30 or something in a swoop and
                  after that all episodes makes no sense at all ... nothing is linked ... romance level is so childish ... there are only 2 characters and both of their stories have no depth at all they could make more details about weapons, armors etc but there is no depth no development about this at all only 2 characters krito and asuna and everyone else looks like NPCs ..... In short: THE MOST BORING ANIME EVER!",1
"
                So I've basically never written a review for anything before, save for a book a few years back I think…
However, I've always wanted to try my hand at 'reviewing' and I believe this particular story is as good a place to start as any.
And so, without further delay, here's my official review of what may be one of the most highly praised (and criticized) anime series of the latter half of this decade!!
Story - 7/10
Though the pacing and plot twists were somewhat lacking, the overall development of context, characters and conflict was pretty great. The premise was fascinating and the progression of events was compelling
                  at so many different points!
I'm extremely disappointed in the show's pace of exposition and I feel that this series (especially the Aincrad arc) could've been expanded by 20+ episodes so as to allow more time for the development of SAO's backstory and characters.
Art - 10/10
Not much to say in regards to this except that the colors were beautiful, the animation was fluid, and the contrast in lighting was stunning.
Sound - 8/10
In my opinion, the music and sound effects were perfectly suited for the story's atmosphere, though I will say that I've heard more memorable and outstanding soundtracks in other shows.
Character - 9/10
The very same reason that these characters receive so much hate is what made me fall in love with them. They are strong, brave, funny and overall fairly appealing, albeit sometimes in unrealistic ways.
I can see why the main pair might be frowned upon for their 'predictable' actions and 'archetypal' personalities, but to say that this detracts from SAO's overall quality would be to betray my inner child; the kid in me who's still continuously thrilled and awestruck by the concept of true, genuine, 'textbook' heroes. 
As for the side characters, I thought they were all equally cool. The reason they might come off to some as bland or superficial would, once again, be owed up to the tragically rushed and neglected delivery of the story…
Enjoyment - 10/10
If you're wondering why this anime still receives an overall 10/10 from me (despite its drawbacks) is because I thoroughly, wholeheartedly enjoyed it. My brain is an imaginative one with roots based in fantasy worlds that exist on a similar, if not equal, scale to Aincrad and Sword Art Online. 
This story and its characters struck a chord with me and touched upon my internal heroic, romantic ideals which haven't been invoked by anime in a very long time.",10
"
                This anime had my full attention two summers ago, and I was 100% ready to watch it. I got what I expected (for the most part): an entertaining and cool-looking anime that had me. The story was well-done, and the episodes fit neatly together.
The pacing is well done, and the fight scenes are super cool. I enjoyed the comedy of SAO, and it was awesome. Until the romance came in. That completely de-railed it for me. I was expecting it, from what the photos were. I started to drift away at the end, as the romance part started to bore me. I found myself not
                  enjoying it as much as I could have. When I finished the series, I did not want to continue to the next season.
As for the animation and character designs, I think it's very well done! The weapons are unique,  and the outfits are on a wide range which was very pleasing to the eye. The backgrounds of the scenes are good, and it's just enough detail that it doesn't take the attention away from the characters. The palettes are very well done and aren't too bright.
I don't remember seeing any of the characters having flaws, but I never truly payed attention to those. I think that the antagonist-whatever his name is-was the most interesting thing in the plot as a whole. They are a good twist, and it left me shocked. 
The supporting female cast all seemed to fall in love (except one but they are the exception) with Kirito (but that just might have been me overthinking things.) But if they actually did, I felt like it was unnecessary to add at all, and the enjoyment level went down a bit.
I would recommend this to others, as I really liked it at first. I won't re-watch as I know what will happen, why, and where. The mystery of everything had been revealed through my first watch. I think this is a unique anime that has potential to be a favourite.",7

                Nowadays, there will always be that one idiot anime fan who will come up to you and start a shitstorm of a conversation by saying the following words: ""Hey there buddy, have you seen Sword art online?"". This type of a comment is usually answered as followed: ""Are you a f****ing weeb."" and thus a new shitstorm is born into this world. Creating yet another argument over the Critically acclaimed Sword art online.
Being relatively new to anime, i might not have the same experience as some other critics out there but i can say for sure that a surprisingly large quantity of them should share
                  my sentiments. So please be prepared as i drop the formalities and dive into the deconstructive criticism of SAO!
So, for anybody out there who has never heard of SAO:
1. What F***ing rock have you been hiding under!
2. This review might contain some mild to big spoilers on the anime. Continue at your own risk.
In a nutshell SAO is an anime based on the light novel series written by Reki kawahara and illustrated by abec.
It follows the life of Kazuto Kirigaya (Kirito) the most overpowered protagonist to ever live. , As i'm sure you already know, it follows him into a VRMMORPG called sword art online, hence the name of the anime. The story revolves around him being OP, a waifu magnet and much more. here is my opinion on it.
1.The art:7
Okay everyone, as i'm sure you have seen, the art style is brilliant especially for an anime that was made in the 2010s.  Personally, i really love the whole vibe that I get when looking at all of the fields and beautiful scenery that was placed in the anime and can hardly imagine a setting like that in real life. There were one or two minor hiccups such as the character design maybe or even the way they did the fan service, but on a whole, i truly believe that this is the best part of the anime (not that that is saying very much).
2.The soundtrack:6
Although i cannot say that i am an expert with music and that i go listening to anime soundtracks just for the hell of it, I can say with all honesty that the opening song and end one werent half bad and added something to the anime.
3.The story:2
Okay, in the experience i have with anime, i have seen a decent amount of isekais and can say that they usually have pretty shitty storylines but out of all of them, im pretty sure that SAO takes the cake. It is truly a one of a kind anime. You dont find many with a plot that jumps around and goes up and down like a whores pantyhose.
Okay, so episode 1 and 2 started off quite well and definitely set the anime up for success, so much so in fact, that you would expect the rest of it to do the same right? Well spoiler alert: It F***ed up there.
it starts off with 2 good episodes and then all of a sudden the next 5 episodes are spent away from the main plot. whether it is introducing new characters or building up the fan service, You can be sure that Kiritos character is definitely not progressing and the anime itself isnt using the full potential that it has been given. Instead of continuing with the whole action and death game plot, they decided lets go and make this into a ecchi fucking fan service compilation and add some slice of life and incest to the mix.
Okay, so now we know that episode 3 through 7 were pointless. Hmmm, perhaps they could fix the first arc within the next 7 episodes but... they DONT!!!!
Instead they set kirito up with Asuna who at first seemed like an independant character who could actually do something in the story and ended up letting herself become Kiritos housewife cook ( and who the fuck lvls up their cooking skill in a death game) 
And if that wasnt enough, all of a sudden kirito gains some sort of super power which puts him at an advantage to everyone else in the game, they practically butchered the concept of MMOs. But knowing all of the bullshit in SAO, we should have already been prepared for this by now right?
Okay, so we determined that it doesnt go that smoothly after it either, kirito loses a battle, ends up joining asunas guild and next thing you know... They spawned a fucking child. yui had no purpose whatsoever, she says that she monitored them and decided that they were the only people in the game who appeared to be pretty normal. But didnt it already explore the fact that others seem stable too. And thus we have a masterful contradiction from SAO.
Okay, now in the end of the arc with no real grounds for it whatsoever, kirito attacks commander heathcliff hoping that his hunch that Heathcliff is actually kayaba (villain who trapped people in the game)is true. Somehow, it turns out that he is right and ends up fighting him, just as he is about to die once again, asuna somehow manages to use willpower to move from stasus in a fucking video game. I know right, It makes total sense doesnt it? anyway, they end up dying but take heathcliff/Kayaba with them, now we expect an explanation as to why the fuck he trapped 10000 players in a death game and this guy takes the bullshit way to far with ""I cant actually remember"" as a fucking answer.
Okay, so now you have finished episode 14 and think to yourself "" damn, im so fucking happy that it is finally over"". Now SAO bitch slaps you in the face with a second arc which somehow turned out to be even more ludicrous than the first. A new villain buys SAO and creates a new game, he traps asuna inside and basically risks being imprisoned and losing billions just to be a pervert with her. And if that alone isnt enough to fuck up arc 2. Kiritos sister adds just the right level of incest to it. But then again who isnt used to incest in anime by now. The whole thing really ticks me off and i think that it is around time i stop talking about it or i might go on ranting about arc 2 for the next 2 hours.
4.Characters:Rating; negative 1000000000000000
1:Kirito- As the main protagonist, we expect him to be somewhat decent and relevant to the plot, however i feel as if pretty much any other character could replace him and make it so much better. Okay, so besides the fact that     
kirito is OP, he is some sort of a Coding genius and at the age of 14! He has everything his way and has an easy life. he basically can do anything he wants. However despite this apparent intelligence, he believes that a revival item can bring a player back to life even though he knows that they would be dead in real life, furthermore, too much of his character is built up on Sachi, she gave him a purpose in the game and died creating his ""tragic story"". somehow he gets unique skills and manages to get to levels which other people cant achieve despite being a solo player. The power dynamic in the game is absolute bullshit. And at one point, he has a regeneration ability which for some reason never works when its actually needed, yeah, i dont get it either but i do know that the whole prospect of him almost dying on a constant basis really pissed me off.
2 Asuna- In the beginning she seems like a rather competant character who is independent and didnt really need kirito. suddenly she turns into the girl in a bra and panties and then all of a fucking sudden she becomes the damsel in distress. talk about a schizophrenic character. She eventually is just there for kiritos white knighting moments and some eye candy for the viewers, i dont feel as if i need to explain any further than that.
3 Sugaha- Kiritos sister was actually a decent character who kind of reminded me of a cross between mikasa from attack on titan and ichigo from darling in the franxx. She had the ability to be a great character but instead was placed there for more useless fanservice and some incest.
4 If there was one other character i felt didnt belong in this anime, it was agil. He is the person who kirito goes to for the rabbit before he sees asuna, although he doesnt get much screentime, i feel as if his character had a significance.
5 yui- The walking deus x machina, kirito and asses child, she is there for no fucking reason whatsoever other than to make kirito even more OP.
6 villain 1- this guy was the piece of shit who trapped them and then apparently forgot the reason... I have nothing else to say
7 villain 2- this guy is there just to continue the story, as i did mention earlier he is the worst villain ever, he risks billions and perhaps arrest just to molest asuna.
8 There are some noticeable side characters like maybe kelin but they are actually of very little significance in the end.
My Big Issues With SAO
At one point i went mad thinking about all the holes in SAO and instead of listing them all, here are the big 5 problems
1 SAO had the potential to be a masterpiece and could have done so if they had just have focused on other aspects such as teens fighting for their lives or the psychological thriller that it could have been. But instead we have an anime which became infamous instead of famous
2 Kirito is set up as an intelligent character and some how can code at 14, has sword fighting skills he didnt learn outside the game and much more.
3 if kirito really is so intelligent how could he go after the revival item and not realise that sachi was dead in real life
4 how did the government not notice radiation hell did they just allow a new person to buy the game after witnessing all that
5 How could the smartest minds in the world not think of just pulling off the helmets really fast to avoid the microwaves from killing people or at least find a way to hack it during the 2 years people were inside the game
In the end i did enjoy SAO but for one reason and one alone. It was fun to analyze it.
If you guys want to see SAO live up to its potential i suggest that you go watch SAO abridged by something witty entertainment, anyway, i hope that you enjoyed the review and can make some use of it
PS the overall rating is 3",3

                Hey there! ;D This is my first anime review ever so it won't be that long.
At first, sorry for my bad language but I'm from Germany xD
You might ask why I gave ""Sword Art Online"" a score of 10???
Some of you will think: This anime is so overrated! 
But in the following lines I'll tell you my opinion about this amazing anime and maybe afterwards you can understand why I gave this score.
Story (10):
Everbody of you knows the story, so I have nothing to add. I read often thinks like: ""The story has such a great potential but after a few episodes it's ruined by
                  the realtionships or it simply sucks!"" I can't understand this point of view. I'm not even a hardcore gamer or something similiar but for me the story is simply amazing. Just imagine you were captured in an online game and it's possible for you to die... I cried 3 fuc*ing times during the first season, because I had to think about this while people were dying (I have to say, I'm a very emotional person). 
Art(9):
The animators did a great job. The design is simple and very colorful! Especially in fighting scences the effects are brilliant. Well done!
Sound(8):
Also the sound was quite enjoyable, four weeks ago i finished the whole anime and there are still some soundtracks, that I can remember! But besides of 3-4 very good songs the rest ist just ""good"".
Characters(10):
This is one of the most important parts. Of course I don't want to spoiler very much so I'll only say something about my favorite ones.
The main characters are Kirito and Asuna. I've never had a girlfriend for long, so this relationship of those is in my opinion the perfect relationship and I thought every time:"" Oh man, let me be Kirito, JUST ONCE!"" :D So yes I enjoyed them. Klein is a very funny guy and I had always to laugh when he said some weird stuff! At least some words about Akihiko Kayaba. He is the ""founding father"" of SAO and there are so many interessting things about him. He makes you think a lot, because he created this system just for enjoyment. Moreover he finds Kirito sympathetic! All in all a very varied and nice mix of charcters!
Enjoyment(10):
I enjoyed everything as you can read above! xD The anime has a good mix between action, romance and story plot.
Overall(10):
I can recommand this one not just for fans of computer games. It's an anime for everybody because you have a lot of action and tension on the one side and some romance on the other side. I have also to say that the German dub has been very welll done! Of course I watched some japanese dubed episodes, too but in comparison with the german ones it's just ""meh"". Don't let you influence by people who say SAO is overrated, because it's you making this decision.
Thanks guys! :D If you want to discuss or talk about something else, just text me ;)

                SOOOO where do i start, OH I Know this series is utter dog shit I can't even comprehend the bull shit coming from people saying its an actual well-written series. Let me start of by saying it was ok for the 1st 4 episodes but then it just went isekai harem mode.... The side characters are horrible the MC is bland and is just every isekai Mc and dong get me started with the villains, the villain didnt even know why he did what he did. they ruined asunas character from a strong female character to a princess needing saving. Everything about this series is
                  also bull shit they had to add 2 episodes for a vacation when they are in the middle of a fucking crisis, Also the ending was absoloute bullshit ( i dont even wanna talk about kiritos plot armor) this seires was overall dogshit i dont have a problem if you enjoyed it but in my opinion its straight dogshit, art: 7/10, music 8/10, plot 2/10, characaters 1/10",2
"
                First review on MAL and i decided to review what i felt after watching SAO (Sword Art Online) because of all the mixed criticism it was getting. so let me get right to it then.
(NOTE - MAY CONTAIN EXTREMELY MILD SPOILERS [MILD SPOILERS ONLY IN STORY REVIEW])
Story - one of the main reasons i feel that this anime has so much mixed criticisms is because of the story and the misleading start that it gave. Like all those who have watched Sword Art Online, i felt that the first 2 episodes of the anime were simply fantastic. there was everything that you ever needed to
                  act as a step-up for the rest of the series. the whole idea of people being trapped in a video game, having to beat the whole thing without losing to it to survive was beautifully portrayed in the first 2 episodes. but then, from the 3rd episode, the story mainly focuses on the main character of the anime, kirito, rather than focusing on the entire effort of the people playing the game in order to get out of it. from then on there are a couple of side stories which focus on kirito as a purpose to build up his character. i do not personally feel anything wrong in that, but i believe that many fans are not really ""fans"" of the whole idea of focusing on a single character just to develop his personality for almost 1/4th of the series when the basic idea of the show is to show action and adventure. 
the reason as to why i called the first two episodes misleading was that they portrayed that the anime would probably be solely centered around action and adventure. but the genre of romance is right there in the anime description. people  are against the whole romance plot in this anime series because anyone would feel sad if someone turned their favourite action series into a romance. but what should be understood is that it was a romance anime from the start. 
for being an action/romance anime, i give it a 8/10... 2 points away from 10 because i too feel that it could have portrayed the action and adventure part more, rather than focusing on kirito's personal life.
Art - the art throughout the entire series was very clean and eye-catching. 1 point away from 10 due to common errors in art in the fingers of characters while running
Sound - i absolutely love the sound in this anime. all the opening and ending themes were absolutely suiting to the plot. the songs themselves without reference to the plot are great and i have almost all of them on my playlist. the effects used during action sequences in the anime were also spot on, the background music as well.
character - only a 6/10 for character because other than kirito, no one else's character was well developed and their entire existence seemed to be focused around kirito alone. that was pretty disappointing.
enjoyment - if you put the thought of SAO being a purely action based anime out of your head, this anime series would be the most enjoyable one you've ever seen. each episode is unique in it's own way and you were absolutely never get bored while watching.
Overall - overall i give this anime a 8/10. if the characters and their development would have been better, it sure would have risen to a 9/10.",8
"
                Wow. Well I thought this anime was actually really good. I really enjoyed the story and I thought it was well put together, I haven't read the manga so this coming from someone who's only watched it, so if you felt the anime didn't do it justice bear with me.
The animation was really smooth but at times they could be a little slacking when it wasn't important but they never failed us during a battle which is what I love. Some animes tend to slack during battles and take the beauty out of them.  So if you're into a good fight I'd suggest it.
                  However I felt the soundtrack was a bit lacking. OP and ED we're fine but the rest of the music left me a bit iffy. Voice actors we're all good though. Did the characters justice according to character.
There's a lovely abundance of feels. Good animes always have feels. haha.
I really enjoyed it but I will say it was predictable toward the final episodes so it only kept me on the edge of my seat during their time in SAO.
Other than that I really do recommend this anime, it does fit the needs of people with different tastes in my opinion and is easily enjoyable. Looking forward to the continuing season as Phantom Bullet.",8
"
                Sword Art Online is quite the rare breed. It is an anime that takes an interesting premise and monumentally screws it up far beyond the point of repair. It is by no means great— hell, it takes a nosedive at the halfway point from which it never recovers— although I can certainly see why it is so loved. It relies on its viewer both suspending their disbelief, and putting themselves in the shoes of its protagonists. So, how does an anime that emphasises style over substance manage to attract such a divided opinion? As a gateway to anime, it’s great. It has slick animation, flashy
                  fight scenes and high levels of drama with an easy-to-follow plot. The tradeoff is it has near zero character development and an overeliance on deus ex machina.    
The plot centres around young Kazuto Kirigaya, known mostly by his in-game name of Kirito. Kirito is one of many who uses NerveGear, a virtual reality headset that allows the user to experience online RPG Sword Art Online as though they were really there. It doesn’t take long for this dream to turn into a nightmare, as it’s revealed that if you die in-game, you die in real life. This is an interesting, original premise, and indeed, the anime had a myriad of paths it could have taken: exploring the psychological effect of being trapped in a death game; or perhaps the camaraderie and opportunism that comes with such high stakes. Instead, the show chooses to throw death at the viewer in every episode, to its detriment. We don’t get to know any of the characters before they either die or go their separate way from Kirito. Girls exist to ride his dual wielding dick, and males exist to either be saved by him or kiss his feet. He’s a Gary Stu,starting as the strongest player and plateauing, frequently overshadowing both enemies and allies. His Mary Sue, Asuna Yuuki, is equally as powerful and undercooked, like a chicken under a flip lighter and is essentially a carbon copy of Kirito when it comes to power level.
  A main character who has no room for improvement right from the get-go may not be enjoyable as far as character development goes, but at least the fights look pretty. The animation is consistently high-tier, while character designs are varied and pleasant. It’s a shame that literally all of them are relegated to single-episode appearances before being lazily reintroduced in the last five minutes of the final episode, with the focus of the series being on the relationship between Kirito and Asuna. 
The first half of the series covers the Sword Art Online MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game), which, if you have ever been interested in such games, is an enjoyable romp and will likely evoke nostalgia. Here, the lacking character development and infuriating timeskips (in which many months and floors of the hundred-floor game are skipped between episodes) can almost be forgiven, as the series moves at a fast pace, moving from short skirmishes to boss fights and even throwing in some half-baked faction conflict and treasure chest traps along the way. Unfortunately, its fast pacing is a double edged sword, as it means each episode generally follows the same formula: Kirito challenges tough enemy, fails once, gains random power up and has teammates cheer, defeats enemy, hailed a hero. The romance that develops between him and Asuna is an interesting aspect, however this is tarnished by their in-game marriage and childbearing. They are teenagers.   
The problems with the series are exacerbated in its second half, which combines a trash plot with incest undertones and an antagonist whose motives and characterisation are both paper-thin. The fights are still as flashy as ever, but the potential world building that could have been is scrapped in favour of a new game world that trades human-like avatars for elves and no penalty for death, making the whole package a risk-free, cutesy bore. The rapey antagonist was the saving grace, being so twisted that he pretty much mirrored my viewing experience: He didn’t give a toss about anything he did and laughed at the world he ruled over and its pitiful players.   
Despite failing to capitalise on its potentially rich world or interesting characters, SAO’s saving graces make it a bearable, if not wholly enjoyable, ride. Consistently amazing animation and varied, pleasant character designs coupled with intense fight scenes will likely satisfy the visual whore inside you, while the music has a very gamey feel. Having dabbled in RPGs myself, the anime was a fine nostalgia vessel, however, nostalgia can’t make up for the abysmal second half that’s as fast-paced as a freshly graduated, ecstacy'd virgin, or the spotlight shining on Kirito and Asuna alone. Like the worst video games, SAO heavily emphasises pretty colours and sounds at the cost of meaningful or insightful drama and characters, and would be completely forgettable if it weren’t so shockingly average in near every department.",5
"
                Now, you may hear alot of crap about Sword Art Online (SAO as i'm going to call it now). It may be good or bad, but that is all up to you to judge from this review or by watching it yourself. I, myself, did actually enjoy SAO, the first half atleast. But let us go straight to the point.
Plot: 7/10
While the concept is nothing new, it does hold itself together. The first couple of episodes were basically fillers and when the actual plot started, it went pretty fast. Same can be said with the romance shown between Asuna and Kirito. But in the end,
                  the plot of SAO is decent and i don't see how someone can hate it.
Art/Animatoins: 10/10
No matter how much you hate SAO, you cannot deny how good the animations are. The animations for SAO is very well done and are one of the best out there. Every thing from the background details to the light in the fighting scenes. Speaking of which, the fights have very nice, fluid movents and beautiful effects.
Sound: 8/10
The music, voiceactors and soundeffect are pretty good. While the track ""Swordland"" is used a bit too much for my taste, the tracks do have a bit of variety and they do sound nice and they do fit the scenes that they are shown in.
For the voiceacting, i can say that most of the cast are relatively new and don't really have too many major roles in other animes. For how good of a job they did, i think that they all did a good job. Kirito espically, had a very good voiceactor that fitted him very well.
And just to fit it in, the opening ""Crossing Fields"" is, though i have grown tired of listening to it, very good song with nice scenery.
Characters: 7/10
The characters are, well... difficult to explain? Kirito is a serious, cocky, strong, calm, slacking, attractive, lucky, smart and kind character, which is a weird combination if you ask me. And like everything else, some like/love it and some dislike/hate it. I, personally, like Kirito alot. For what reason? Í think it is his design, voice and way of fighting.
Speaking of character designs. The clothing for the characters are pretty unique and it is meant in a good way of course.
Personal enjoyment: 9/10
Again, alot of people hate SAO while alot love it aswell. I think that i'm joinnig the loving site. But i do admit the there are alot of flaws, but i also accept them. Which is actually the whole point of this review. If you like something, good. If you dislike something, it is unavoidable. But neither of these sites should go rub up against each other.
So don't go hating on SAO. While some people may support, alot of people are going to fight against you. And in the end, you have only wasted yours and other people's time.
If you have read this far, i thank you. If you haven't watched SAO yet, i thnk you should atleast check it out. If you like it, continue. If you dislike it, drop it and don't force yourself to continue. But until next time, farewell.
By the way, Gun Gale Online is fucking awesome!",8

                Considering I personally am an MMORPG player, I liked the sound of this anime from the get go. I watched the first episode and was absolutely amazed. I loved watching what had been brought to life by the technology. Then Kayaba appears in the town square and delivers the fateful news: there is no logging out from Sword Art Online. You have to clear all one hundred levels. If you die in game, you die in real life.
I fell in love with this anime. I found all the plot twists and the character developments interesting and suspenseful. And then finally, the boss battle comes.
Personally I
                  wasn't a fan of Alfheim Online as so many people aren't, as the whole fairy rescue and semi incest thing didn't really interest me as much as Aincrad did. But it must be said: Sword Art Online is truly a work of art.",10
"
                I don't know what to say other than, Outstanding.  Story Development, Art, Sound, Character Development, Enjoyment, Overall are all 10's for me.  The first like 6 episodes are hard to follow, but after that, is when the story really starts to take shape.  I was a little hesitant with starting it, and regret doing that.  It has easily become my 2nd favorite, if not my all time favorite anime of all time.  I put it off thinking it was something else, because the summary i read about it on a different site gave a completely different feel about it than
                  it actually was.
I've watched it 3 times in the month i first started watching it, and i want to continue watching it again and again.  You may think at first, Oh its just a .Hack// remake.  And thats where your wrong.  I had initially thought, ""Oh its sort of like .Hack//""  But after a little bit, i saw that it was nothing like .hack//.  This anime is alot better than any of the .hack// series.  It has a deeper story that gets you attached.  It makes me really want to play a game like that, and experience all the emotions that everyone in the game experienced.  Knowing that it was a game, yet knowing that if you died, you were really dead.  People living their lives in the game as if they lived there their whole life.  People trying so hard to complete the game and go back to their lives.
So many emotions went through me in the middle of the anime, and when it ended, I wanted more.  They have the Manga for it, so it wouldnt surprise me if they made another season or 2.
If your looking for an anime that has a little bit of action, a little bit of Romance, a little bit of Comedy, and drama, then Sword Art Online is for you.  I honestly don't think i'll find an anime that i like as much as this one any time soon.",10

                A review for one the most overrated anime's of 2012... Sword Art Online
Story: 7
The story can be divided into two different arcs the first being the Aincrad Arc which is better arc of the two having a fun and morbid story following Kirito as he tries to survive the VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality, Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) death game Sword Art online in which he has been trapped in after its realise with thousands of other player with a great twist that if you die in game you die for real. At first this may seem similar to the .hack franchise or Log Horizon
                  but instead of people standing around talking or working politics theirs more shiny battles and great boss fights more like MMOs which add a element that these player could die at any second as well as that the players are even more dangerous touching upon personality changes when people play games while throwing in different game phrases to make it seem more like a game.
But there are some problems with the story as instead of going from the day one and showing the main character slowly growing stronger as he conquers the game instead you are treated to random time skips that more act as fillers as the Kirito meets new characters to interact and help while it does show some great boss battles as he conquers floors he mainly at the starts of the series helps poor weaker characters who will either die or never seen again through out the whole show. This parrelled with the forced romance subplot that doesn't feel very real that really feels that it reads more time to develop. 
The second half of the plot The Fairy Dance arc taking place directly after the first one can be summed up briefly as a complete mess with a boring story and characters that are forgettable except from Leafa/Suguha who is main characters Kirito's cousin who at least has some development and interesting characters as well strange feelings for her cousin (wincest). Not forgetting the boring politics side story and some tentacle fun and molesting like scenes that spoil the atmosphere at time.
Characters: 6
The Characters of SAO are its weakest piece with flat boring main characters with no real personality firstly Kirito as all he is that Over Powered knight in shining armour with a harem on the side type while Asuna the lead female character has more personality as seems quite interesting at the start but as she progresses she becomes a dumbed down whiny girlfriend that just as boring as Kirito. The side characters are the better side of the cast with really personality's and interesting stories but have little screen time only on for a episode or a few minutes every few episodes. The only other main character with an real development was Leafa/Suguha who has a nice personality and bit of development during her role in the Fairy Dance Arc.
Animation: 9
One of the better aspects of the show is its animation and visuals with amazing set pieces that look beautiful and unique every time a new one appears making the setting feel more like a game with well done towns, dungeons and wilderness that is eye candy. As well as great animation from all characters that make them feel real and amazing fight scenes that beautiful and worthy of all praise
Sound: 10
The OST is amazing and has a track for every scene in the anime making each scene feel new and interesting from cheerful town music, great fight music to sad tone sounds all in orchestra format done by Yuki Kajiura the master behind the Madoka Magica soundtrack. Voice work is also great making all characters feel alive and interesting even the boring Kirito and Asuna.
Enjoyment:
I liked the Aincrad Arc, and thought the Fairy Dance Arc was Mehh.
Score: 7.4/10",7
"
                Sword Art Online is one of those anime's that you look forward to seeing every week, just patiently waiting for it to come out. 
One of the  reasons that I always looked forward to Sword Art Online is because it's a unique anime and you will probably never find anything with a similar feeling while watching it.
While the story was extremely good in the first half, it got a bit boring nearing the end, sure there was lots of action, but it lost its feel of danger and being trapped inside a game that must be cleared.
The sound and music in this anime is
                  what I really loved about it, in any scenario in this anime, it would have perfect sounds and/or music in the background, which really called out to me and made me want to watch even more.
The characters were fairly well done, the art for them was very good, but the way they acted could have been improved.
This anime was very enjoyable, I would literally wait hours for the next episode to come out on the day it aired, patiently waiting for a sub to come out.
Overall, the anime was Very good, while some things could have been improved, it was great! 
For recommendations, I would recommend anyone who loves watching anime's that have a slight touch of danger in it and anyone who loves MMORPGs and Anime.",8

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.
Sword Art Online first season from episodes 1 - 15 was good really good, mostly because it had so much action, puzzling. Earlier this year when Sword Art Online hit its halfway point, I called it the smartest anime I had seen in years because of its in-depth look at the long-term effects of being trapped in a virtual reality world. This last week Sword Art Online finished its run on Japanese TV. And while the second half of the series was still entertaining, it didn't quite manage to live up to the thematic highpoints of the first half.
When I wrote my
                  review of the first half of SAO, I had seen up to episode twelve. The main characters were off on a series of side-stories as part of their honeymoon, and there were still 25 floors left to clear till the end of the game. Little did I know that two episodes later, the series would change completely due to the greatest plot twist ever: the hero wins early.
After discovering the creator of the game is actually one of the players—and the final boss of the game to boot—the creator gives Kirito the chance to fight a one-on-one duel. In any other anime, the hero would have lost and the villain would have escaped to await the main characters at the final dungeon. But in SAO, Kirito wins, and the villain, true to his word, sets everyone free from the online world. What's more impressive is that this doesn't happen at the halfway point of the series where you might have expected it; rather it happens two episodes after that. Moreover, it happens right after a seemingly irrelevant side-story about fishing, making it one of the most unexpected plot twists I have ever seen. But the second half reminds me a lot of Zelda?
Thanks for reading let me know what you think ;)",8
"
                Sword Art Online (SAO), was the most hyped series for 2012.  The hype gave the series very high expectations, and some feel that the series met those expectations, while others felt that this series was utter trash.
The reason why most people feel that SAO is terrible is because of the characters and character development.  New characters are introduced only to show how badass Kirito is and increase his harem.  Each new character gets one episode, and then forgotten for the rest of the series.  The only female character that I actually thought had an impact was Sachi.  Sachi emphasized death
                  to Kirito and kind of(?) gave Kirito the inspiration to protect everyone.  The one flaw with Sachi was that they killed her off way too early, because I didn't even feel sad for her at all. 
A lot of people also complain about the time skips, how it started off from episode 1 and then jumped to episode 50.  Lets be honest though, do we really want to watch Kirito enter a new floor, grind, look for the boss room, and then defeat the boss for every single floor?  It'd get really repetitive, so what the writer tried to do was skip to the floor where minor events took place to keep us interested.  
The art and sound were outstanding in my opinion.  I felt that the art was amazing until the Alfeim Arc.  That's when I thought the art got a little sloppy.  The openings, endings, and OST were great.  
Watching an anime isn't like being in English class.  You just need to enjoy it. I did enjoy SAO, despite its flaws.  That's really all that matters to me.  But because of it's poor execution, I have to give this series a 7.5/10 (rounded to 8).
If you want to turn your brain off and just enjoy watching a badass in all black overpower the sh** out of everyone and get all the girls he wants, SAO  is the perfect anime for you.",8
"
                Alright alright, before I start this review on tis let me just get something off my chest real quick. First this anime may is good and I recommend it to all the gamers and anime fans out there. But really pissed me off was all the haters made this anime seem bad (which its not) I know there could have been more like less romance. If you don't like the romance don't watch the anime and also about how they rushed, if you wanted more of then read the novel or wait for more chapters of the SAO progressive to come out.
On to the review,
                  to me Sword Art Online was a good anime up to the 14 episode but then things start to drop ( I won't tell you why because then it would be a spoiler) but I liked it none the less the art was great and the enjoyment I got out of SAO really made me happy. But its true there was some downers like after the 14 episode which really made the story go into loops and got me a little upset that something that was so good when down to like a roller coaster. Out of 1 to 10 I'm willing to give SAO about a 7 mainly because its pretty good but I don't expect this anime to become a big one like Naruto or DBZ.
Thats all thanks for reading.",7
"
                I've mainly seen people give poor almost hateful reviews on SAO, so I thought I'd touch on what makes this anime so genius. The Art and Sound (9/10) are a given as the anime is so well produced with an excellent A-List cast, but in terms of the Story and Enjoyment, I'll focus on a few points that so many critics miss completely.
Story (7/10) and Enjoyment (10/10): 
- For SAO these two categories very much feed into each other. As you watch SAO, you'll quickly realise that it was directed with the main goal being ""enjoyment of the masses"".
- For quite an interesting concept, it
                  takes an extremely simple storyline with time skips and character side stories. This obviously takes away from what could have been an extremely deep and dramatic plot, however adds so much enjoyment value.
- The time skips add a good pace to the story that maximises viewer interest by not dragging on any particular part of the story, so basically you'll never get bored.
- The anecdotal style side stories adds light-heartedness to what is a very serious overarching theme and develops character relationships a lot. 
- The character synergy is what really makes this show enjoyable as it makes the whole show really natural and boosts the comedic value during the comedy scenes.
- Despite the story being simplified, it is still very good. It focuses strongly on ROMANCE and is done so well. The love story in SAO is the best one I've seen to date as it develops so much and progresses to a point that is really rare in anime.
- The non-complicated storyline that the director chose to take makes the anime so good for those new to anime or are casual watchers, but also those seasoned fans who are rewatching the anime as the story isn't one of those complicated ones that pivot around a few huge plot twists where once you know the underlying plot it stops being interesting.
- I've just watched SAO for the 5th time and each time feels like the first. The rewatch value is so high (10/10) which really is something that is so important to those of us who watch loads and loads of anime and is what will make SAO an all-time classic that fans just keep on watching for years to come.",10

                Review
Story
Ok when i first watched the anime i thought to myself ""This anime is going to be great where people get stuck inside of the VR and if the parent try to unlik them they die and if they die in game they die for real. The first two episodes showed great potential for the anime on how it sets up the mood , Showing us the characters and the plot, But once episode 3 happened they seemed to be rushing themselves and seeming a lot of time skips making you ask yourself ""Ok.. How did Kirito progressed? How did he trained?"" And why did
                  Asuna suddenly fall in love with him? All we see is some clips of him and her sharing same house being all lovey dovey for some reason. withing 26 episodes they completed 2 arcs which could be more than 50 episodes if they did not rushed the anime. The other main problem i find is when Kirito is on verge of dying the system glitches making him live with 1 hp or giving him an op move for no reason. One of the main guys forget why he trapped them all in the first pace, The second is just a pervert wanting Asuna to himself which to me is not a good plot... If i want to watch a love triangle with bad story concept i'd go watch reality tv or soap drama. And finally for the second ark of the series... The reason why kirito won is because the first major boss he killed you know dead gave him access to the mainframe/power
Art:
To me it is not bad but not really... Unique as it is like most other anime art style. Though the map and landscape is of a fantasy game style which is really nice
Sound:
The music they added in and the timing is really great to listen to, They had perfect timing and tones to suit the emotions
Characters:
Kirito:
... What can i say? First he is bland having no personality what so ever and yet for some reason girls fall in love with him? Ughh...Second he is a total idiot, I mean more than 100 people died because of him keeping his identity and not acting more bolder when he been in the beta along with his level is pretty high up. Yes you may say so he can stay alive but mind you to me he supposed to die at the first boss where a lot of people die but the system glitches out letting him live. Third people say ""What's wrong with him being op"" Nothing wrong with being OP as long their is a good  reason behind it. For example in Dragonball series it explains sayians get power boost when nearly killed due to DNA, And Tatsuya from the irregular high school where he got experimented on, But for Kirito? Noo.. they just slapped on powers when he is on verge of 'dieing' 
Asuna:
For the first 3-5 episodes she seemed like a strong female character that do not need to rely on anyone. Being able to handle Players, NPCS and monsters with her Rapier which was really good. Then for some reason after the time skip she seeming to be dependent on kirito and becomes 1950's house wife allowing the men go out to work while she does house work. Why? She would be really good fighting along with bland kirito.. Which brings another point Why did she fall in love with?
Majority of females Kirito meet:
They either die... Or for some reason fall in love with his bland character but again like Asuna you do not see them fight as this turned the VR anime into a harem anime which i hate the most, Yes personal opinion i hate Harems
Bad guys:
Ok first major bad guy... He forgets why he trapped them inside the game
Second major bad guy, He wants Asuna to himself by keeping her in the game
Third.. Well there is just a bunch of people wanting to kill people that is all
Enjoyment:
Though many people try and defend this title saying it was good i did not enjoyed it that much which why i dropped it
Overall:
The anime has great potential but it got flushed down the drain as it;
Skipped time
Poorly made character development
As for people saying it original/unique.. Not its not there is more VR games made before this got created even manga wise like//hack.sign",3

                SAO is a unique show in terms of plot, what starts as an alternate world setting moves back and forth between the real world and the virtual one. Action is a sticking point in SAO, there's countless fights and frightening scenes. The first part of the show offers a romantic adventure, things later change as the story progresses. There's occasional laughs and tears, but the story has a theme of fear of the unknown; In that sense SAO really is an adventure show at heart. Voice acting is enjoyable for the most part. If I had to say something good about SAO it would be
                  the art, there are stunning scenes almost every episode. Art detail and use of color is unrivaled, far better than anything else out there. Area palettes, decorations, shadows, and character detail have a depth to them, its eye candy everywhere. Animation is excellent, fights are gorgeous, movements are fluid, character hair flows as if this was some kind of shampoo commercial. Characters are ridiculously stylish, character detail is perfect. The cast is near legendary, characters are endearing and interact with a warm sense of camaraderie. Music can range from above average to incredible, the 1st OP song is incredible. Lines and dialogue can at times be moving, very entertaining most of the time. If you are into fast paced action, SAO does it nicely. If I had to say something bad about SAO it would be that the story is chopped up into blocks, a linear story would be far better, so viewers might be upset that several key parts of the original story don't ever get animated. Stick to the light novel if it upsets you too much. Over time the plot of the story drastically changes several times, so there are parts that you might enjoy and others that you will find boring, it can drift like those other shows that feel like they will never end. At times it may seem like the show tries to take on too many facets; action and drama are the best qualities this show displays. Favorite character: Asuna. I give it a 9.2/10 although this is still ongoing.
TLDR Version: Visually amazing, stylish, great action, cast, and VA. Shouldn't this have ended already?",9
"
                What makes a great Anime? Well that answer varies from person to person. I think the most important thing in a great Anime, as in any great experience in life, is emotional investment. How much of our heart and mind are putting into the story that is unfolding before our very eyes? I myself have gotten deeply involved in many titles. They each have similar features. Characters that we like and dislike. A world that inspires emotion. A story that grips our attention. Add emotional investment to that and you have a recipe for greatness. But, what if an Anime can successfully pretend to be
                  great? To put up the illusion that it is something it's not. An illusion so perfect, you'd almost believe it was the real thing... A-1's ""Sword Art Online"" does exactly that.
This show makes a lot of people's top ten lists. It's by no means bad. It is good. But, it's shortcomings are where it pretends to be something it's not. Let's start with the overall story. A massive MMO game driven by virtual reality technology takes a bizarre twist when the players are locked in and made to fight for their very lives. You die in the game, you die in real life. Good emphasis is placed on this. A month in and thousands are dead. This is gripping stuff. We get main characters that are likeable enough to get behind, albeit cookie cutter at times, and the idea of the long journey still ahead makes us wonder who will be left when all is said and done. The atmosphere is set. And then they ruin it...
The story shifts gears VERY abruptly and it succeeds in destroying what promise it had story wise. The stakes are decidedly lower and it becomes a simple ""damsel in distress needs to be saved by her knight in shining fairy wings"" tale. A fairy tale? Tee hee. By the time you get over the change up and into what's new, the show is over. Such beauty in each world. They definitely put the ""Art"" in ""Sword Art Online"". And yet, the creators of the show chose to barely use these great and limitless concepts, selling themselves short on two occasions. They crapped the bed on the story and then cut the legs out from under the art. Still, good art.
When the story changed, the characters, too, lost their edge. To quote Thomas Paine, ""The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; tis dearness only that gives everything its value."" I cannot feel the same about characters when their challenge has become considerably less risky. They are less endearing. And adding in some basic romance and a little twist involving the dangers of on-line avatars isn't gonna help. Checking the score, they messed up the story, sold the art short, and took all the momentum from the characters. And they act like this is supposed to be great because we have some good SFX, pretty good fight scenes, and a standard musical score that just adds choirs to make it sound more epic. The Sub vs. Dub battle here was actually a good one for a change. I really liked both performances from both casts and felt they gave it their all. In my opinion, you could watch either one and get a good experience. But, I prefer the Japanese cast just a skoshi bit more than the English.
Let's be honest here. Stop pretending this is anything special. A fantasy world with swords and magic that has decent characters and some okay story telling. Been there done that endless times. The irony of ""Sword Art Online"" is it did to the viewers what the game did it's players. It sold us a bill of goods, promising an experience like none other. Then it trapped us into something we didn't sign up for and it was a struggle from then on to salvage our enjoyment and save ourselves from the death that is disappointment. This is a good show pretending to be a great one. Like any MMO, you can try to pretend to be something you're not and for awhile it's fun, but at the end of the day you have to come back to a less impressive reality. And it's that let down that kills ""Sword Art Online"". 7/10. Still worth your time to check it out. Cheers!",7

                GENERAL - So Sword Art Online...  You'll love it or hate it. The premise of it is simple a game is released with a new hardware piece called nerve gear. After the beta test and the full game is released out our male lead Kirito joins on to see the new changes now that the game has come out for the public. All of a sudden there is no logout button. The game creator explains that they are trapped. If they die in the game they will die in real life. The nerve gear is what will kill them in real life and if
                  someone tries to remove the headset it will kill them as well.  So the game is a MMO RPG. In this game there are 100 floors. The only way they can escape is to get to the 100th floor and defeat the final boss only then will they be freed from this world.
So the story sounds very strong it has great potential so where exactly does it go wrong? Well the main issue is the time skips. We don't reallly get to see many of the floors acutallly being defeated a large part of the show is this slice of life type asepct within it. That isn't a bad thing exactly but it takes a way more tiem form the main sotry of it.
Okay now I do want to cover something else. Sword Art Online Progressive.
Its what SAO should be. It takes way more time to describe each floor and puts a focus on how to defeat the bosses itself and does a great job of making SAO into the story it should be. Now if it is ever animated this will fix nearly every problem that this series has.
Okay so I won't reallly cover the second arc. The premise isn't the greatest it may keep you interested but its nothign amazing and there are some other issues with it beyond that.
CHARACTERS - Okay I will only cover our 2 main leads here Kirito and Asuna.
Kirito is a simple character he is just that person that can win and he doesnt receive much character development. Not the greatest lead for a series at all but hie may be a fine character to others.
Asua starts off as a great character. She was the strong female protagonist of the show. Later on though she becomes a week charcter that always relies on Kirito to save her.
So this takes me back to SAO Progressive. Again even though its not in this anime series itself in Progressive these issues are next to none. The focus is put on Asuna which acts as a much greater lead then Kirito. If there is EVER a Progressive anime these complaints are next to non existent.
SOUND - Sword Art Online has one of the  greatest OST's in an anime. It has many soundtracks that  you may expect to hear in a real video game and can range from intense battle music to lighter soundtracks for the more slice of life parts of the anime.
ART / ANIMATION - Simply, the animation is amazing. Its bright popping colors and its very fluid animation is amazing and does a great job of showing how great some animation can be. The world of this game is brought to life  greatly with its animation.
OVERALL - Well even though the show has many issues I do not feel its something to be skipped.  When it comes to a series like this that is ofen overrated or hated you can not often find someone who is in between on it. 
While I can see SAO's flaws it still has some parts to it that can be fun to watch.
SCORE - 7.2
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT - 8.0",8

                First Review of Anime!
I do Reviews of anime's I've watched, to share and hopefully get anime fans to get interested.
So to start off my first review, I'll start off with the first Anime I've watched. Sword Art Online. 
I'll organize my anime as categories:
-Main Idea Of Anime
-Characters-Finally, Overall Rating
Main Idea Of Anime
Sword Art Online is a mixture of, romance, action, and an adventure, kind of anime that'll make you want to watch more. It starts off in the future I assume with the technology, such as ""The NerveGear"" which is a very advance Japanese version of todays Oculus Rift. A fun game world that most MMOPRG's are like, starting off, creating a character, get the basics, meet friends, level up, and loop. (I'm not a MMORPG player, so sorry for the lack of info of MMORPG's are like.) All the fun and games change dramatically when the creator of the game makes an announcement of the removal of the ""LogOut"" button. He also announces the possible death of the real life player using the NerveGear (If you do watch the anime, or have, you understand.) To win the game, and escape, the players must go through all 100 Stages of bosses and monsters. The protagonist, Kirito, is the beta player that got to the highest level than the other beta players. Kirito is joined by another player, Asuna, and progresses with her throughout the show, in both seasons. He meets others and continues to go through stages with friends.
Characters
Kirito - The Main Protagonist - an interesting character that shows affection as a boyfriend, a bestfriend, an older protective brother, also a father figure.
Asuna - a ""kawaii"" character that is an important part of the story line. She is a nice, older sister, bestfriend, a girlfriend, and also a mother figure.
Kirigaya - Kirito's real life sister - a loving sister, that cares for her brother anyway possible. Even though she doesn't play a huge roll for a bit, she is some how mentioned through out the first episodes.
Silica - a kawaii girl that is also another player, that has a younger sister vibe.
Yui - a very kawaii ""player"" that has a daughter like vibe
Lisbeth - Also like Silica, she's a blacksmith that helps Kirito along the way.
Sachi - also like the others, Lisbeth/Silica, but has a different vibe. A sister vibe.
Klein - sort of a protagonist, that is also important to the story line. The bestfriend and brother vibe. 
(I didn't do the full cast, because they are either part of the 2nd Season, or aren't as much important to the storyline... Plus, I wouldn't remember everything about each character.)
Overall Rating
(Plot and Setting were mostly mentioned in the ""Main Idea Of Anime"")
This show, is what got me interested into anime. The plot and the story line was very good and impressive in the beginning, but as the show progressed... it was the opposite of wine, where wine get older and better.. but Sword Art Online was amazing at first, but as it got older (Progressed) it wasn't as amazing to watch.
I'd give it... a 3.5 out of 5 or a 5.5 out of 10
But despite the rating I gave it, I'd suggest the show to any new comer to anime
Please do not hate of my opinion of this anime. If you have anything to discuss with me, comment section is always available, and if I missed anything, please let me know! Also. Please if you'd like me to review an anime of your choice, let me know! I'd happily review it. Anyway. Have a great day/night!﻿",6

                Time for the next review...Whelp, here goes nothing.
Let's face it, we all want to going into a game and experience it firsthand. So the question arises, what happens when a guy takes that idea and makes an anime out of it?Sword Art Online (aka SAO) is an anime where virtual reality MMOs are a thing allowing people to actually play inside of a game. While this is a really good concept, SAO is not the best example for it. 
The thing that made SAO stand out was the fact that the game was literally a game of life and death where dying in game would
                  mean death in real life. This would be an amazing part of the entire anime, but unfortunately the life and death concept is not even expanded on in the second half of the anime.
The main character is another problem with the anime. Kirito, our protagonist, only goal in the anime is beating the game which in turns causes him to become overpowered for the sake of the game which is weird in a game that has a level system. If his levels showed his progression through the game it would not be a huge problem, but the anime has so many timeskips within it that the viewer is left to themselves to guess what he did to gain those levels.
Though the anime had it's problems, it did have some nice touches to it. The voice acting was nice and did not sound awkward while at the same time gave scenes that helped with the overall tone of the anime. The setting was very nice and well thought out, even if it was not expanded on as much as I would have liked.
Saying SAO was bad would be incorrect while at the same time it was not good either. This anime is more of an anime that you would only enjoy if you are the type of guy who asks yourself ""What if I was in this world?"". This anime is not for everyone, so I'll let you decide if it's the thing for you.",6
"
                Hm. Well as someone who is super new to anime and the such, SAO was definitely one of those shows I've heard about never actually seen. Until now. Well honestly I thought it was alright. Now if you have read any other reviews of this anime, you'd probably now by now that the things that made it terrible/bad were the story and characters, and I can definitely attest to that. Naturally, with any sort of narrative medium with a protagonist, there is some (or none in some cases,) plot armor to be had, but in SAO, once they had established that he was basically a
                  god, all fear of ""close situations"" went out the window. Asuna is a flawless partner to Kirito. When I saw the ending of the first arc, I was pretty disappointed, but honestly if it had just ended there (maybe one more episode to tie things up) it would have been a decent 7. Nah. We got another arc, except this time it's way more rushed and felt like a slapped-on, uninspired, sequel within the season itself. Towards the end, I felt like I was just watching it to get it over with, and that is definitely something you don't want to feel when watching an anime (well at least I would assume..). However, the art and soundtrack/VA is pretty good imo. 
TL;DR SAO is basically one of those hot girls/cheerleaders at your high school. Super hot, looks nice, sounds nice, but once you get to know her, it's nothing that you expected from your outside perception.",6
"
                I personally didn't like it, no one will make me change my mind, and I seriously don't care for fanboys/fangirls. Let me elaborate. It was sold to me by friends and many commercials as a Seinen, it turned out to be a Shounen which I could deal with, I love Shounen, but as it kept going on and on, it implemented more and more Shoujo components and in the end tried to pass a bit of ryona. All this was extremely confusing! 
Sword Art Online is to me, the anime most ""all over the place"" in history. At some point, it almost loses every component
                  that might interest a guy to watch it, and any guy would pick Accel World / .HACK series before it.
You go in for the MMORPG, the story and the fights, and this will work out great the first 6 or 7 episodes, some might argue that guys will stick around until episode 14, hell, I watched it until episode 15, you will be loving the show by then, and then you're stuck in an extremely poorly written story with a lots of forced components that no one with the slightest bit of intelligence can take seriously, an insane number of plot holes, and poorly explained crap, even for an anime. 
I seriously had to stop watching it at episode 15, it was a deal breaker for me, and the fact that they destroyed an anime that could potentially be very good, is more of a reason to dislike it, you don't turn your back to your fanbase like that midways through a season.
Also, prepare for the over-dramatic scenes, the unnecessary killing of important characters to give it depth, but not actually going ""there"". It's like they are trying to add the horror of Full Metal Alchemist and Ao no Exorcist, but if you're going to do it, then go full blown horror, because horror suited for all ages is just wrong. 
The ending of episode 15 was just an excuse to air another 10 episodes. The story lost all credibility more times than I could handle it, and most likely, not many people are going to watch Season 2.",6
"
                Personally I found this entire anime to be extremely clever.  In the midst of reading the light novel series I found the anime to be very close if not exact to the books.  The anime takes place over a span of years which helps the watcher/reader  get to know the characters.  The anime shows the emotional toll of the players stuck in the game which helps the viewers to relate to the characters.  The show also gives a look into the lives of the players outside of the game; however most of the anime is focused on the world of
                  SAO and the outcomes of being trapped in there for years.  Overall I was extremely happy to see this anime and I hope for a third season.",10
"
                Please don't watch this anime. Please don't. Because it is a major disappointment to the anime genre as a whole.
SAO demonstrates what damage bad writing could do to an anime. Despite its first class music(Rated a 10/10), and real good art, just a bad writing on the author's part can really just destroy the anime's quality. Perhaps this is a good example for ""Takes generations to build, but destroyed in a second.""
Except that there were many seconds which destroyed the anime. Let me start listing.
This is a hentai anime.  THAT'S RIGHT. HENTAI. So, don't watch it if you don't want the writer's fetishes (I
                  am not lying!)
This anime features a god. THAT'S RIGHT. GOD. So stop watching it those who believe in some god, because this one is gonna ruin your faith. And those who don't believe in god, don't watch it all the same, because you will never believe the plot armor this god wears.
This anime has incest. THAT'S RIGHT. INCEST. So stop watching it if you don't like incest. Or bad writing that makes even a sister as a love interest. Oedipus would be ashamed of you.
This anime has no morals. THAT'S RIGHT. NO MORALS. So stop watching it if you believe in a world with morals. Especially a one where a mass murderer is hailed as a good man by the hero.
THAT'S RIGHT. SAO is not as good as you thought it was. So don't watch it. You won't right? RIGHT????",1
"
                I was hesitant to watch this anime after seeing the plethora of mixed reviews.  It seems you either adore this anime or absolutely hate it.  After seeing it myself I felt I had to write what I felt about it, because while it was not perfect, I utterly fell in love with its world and characters.  Like that old beater of a car you had that billowed smoke and all your friends laughed at, but you completely adored nonetheless.
That's why I gave this anime such a high score.  To me the overall feel of anime and my enjoyment thereof far outweighs
                  the couple of scenes I didn't like (there were two scenes especially I absolutely hated, and one or two finer details that bothered me but not nearly enough to ruin the show)
Story (8/10)
The story was unique and very clever.  The first arc was the best of all and the only reason it did not get full marks was because they did a lot of time skips.  I honestly think the first arc could have taken up 2 whole seasons.  That being said, I felt the time skips were well done.  You see the growth in Kirito especially (I would have liked to see more in Asuna though) and important milestones are shown that when pieced together start to flesh out Kirito's personality.  The story has it all:  Explosive action scenes (the fights are really well done), an amazing world, a refreshingly unique romance that is different from most anime's out there, and a whole lot of feels.
Art (8/10)
The art was beautiful and consistent.  Action scenes were mind-blowing and the worlds of SAO and Alfheim were stunningly detailed.  Landscapes were breathtaking and the scope of it was huge!
Sound (9/10)
Even the haters of SAO have to admit that the score was nothing short of a masterpiece.  Sound affects were good too, especially the sword fights and in game sound effects which sounded incredible.   Even the opening and ending songs were good.  No complaints here.
Characters (8/10) 
I liked just about every character in SAO and really felt that I got to know them...except for ***SPOILER ALERT FOR A FEW PARAGRAPHS*** the dumbass hentai slugs which don't fit into the story at all and the villain at the end of the second arc
A lot of people also complain about the Harem aspect of it, but I honestly didn't see any of that (in the light novels or both seasons of the anime).   A lot of the girls do like Kirito and try to flirt with him but he only deflects their advances away, and when they all learned about Asuna they backed off rather quickly despite maybe still having a crush on him. 
I also really liked Kirito's character, despite people complaining that he was very much a Gary Stu.  At the start of the anime we see a lonely, withdrawn guy who is somewhat disconnected from reality.  He is awkward around others, and not very social.  Because of the fact that he prefers to spend his time playing games, he has unsurprisingly become really good at them.  This combined with his unique out of the box perspective when it comes to solving problems, his understanding of the game as a beta tester and sly mind make him very powerful in the SAO world.  Despite his incredible strength, he makes decisions he regrets and as well as many mistakes along the way.  Another thing I enjoyed about him was his love for playfully teasing others as seen throughout the series.  He is powerful, but far from a perfect gary stu and definitely not boring.
Asuna is another character I loved.  People seem to hate that she is a badass and has maxed out waifu skills.  I say why can't she have both?  Nothing wrong with being able to make a killer sandwich after a tough boss fight is there?  On many of the reviews that I saw, I noticed people hating that she became a damsel-in-distress in the second arc (like actually needing help from a male friend diminishes her worth as a person somehow).  It isn't like she had a choice in the matter.  I mean she nearly escaped from the Game Admins clutches on her own!  and without her quick thinking, Kirito would never have been able to save her.  I guess I will never understand the hate.
The other characters were diverse and fun.  I really liked Egil, Klein and Lisbeth.  Yui was just plain adorable.  i didn't think much of Leafa, but that may be because of the cringes I got for the whole loving her brother a little too much thing.  
***END OF SPOILERS***
Enjoyment (10/10)
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.  The feeling I got while watching it was nostalgic of the feeling I got from some of my first animes!  I couldn't wait to get home from work so I could continue watching.  It made me laugh, made me cry, and made me excited whenever something badass was going on.  Keep in mind this is a Shounen anime that has a nice mix of action, comedy, drama and romance with very little ecchi (the one or two scenes with ecchi feel so out of place and weird).  So judge it as such.  It is not an Oscar-winning story, or the paragon of the romance genre of anime.  But it is definitely very entertaining to watch.
Overall (10/10)
Was I left wanting more?  Would I buy the Blue Rays?  Would I re-watch it?  Did it make me go out and read the Light Novels?  Did it make me want to write a review about it?
Yes to all of the above!  One of my favorites for sure",10
"
                Sao is one of the well known and popular anime in nowadays. Though it has a huge hatebase. Well, there's also a lots of reason. In sao, Kirito, the main character, gets locked within a game. A game where you once lose, you die in the real world. Having such a great plot, I really had high expectations from this. But it all get ruined. As expected, Kirito becomes hopeless and very lonely in the game. Meanwhile, In his journey, he comes to meet a lots of people. Some stay temporary in his life, some forever. The romance in Sao maybe a bit realistic, but
                  disappoints me in many parts. The true reason of behind creating sao was never revealed either, coz the person forgotit. 
Whatever, as we see, in the end, the only character who got development was Kirito. The all minor character and main antagonist sucks. Even the main female character gets worse too. That's why I am giving this series to 4/10 rating.",4
"
                SAO was the best anime I've seen for a very long time.
[Possible Spoilers]
First I'll start with the story. The story was very intriguing. Set in the future, a normal boy has just started playing a newly released game. After a few minutes, he makes his first friend. He, however, received the game early during a beta test so already knew what to do. He taught his new friend everything. This boy was named Kirito. When Kirito's friend had to log off, they discovered the log out button was missing. This started a huge fight of survival to beat the game so that they could be
                  freed. When they eventually get out, Kirito's lover, Asuna, is still trapped inside. This launches another plot of finding Asuna and returning her to the real world from an entirely new game with a new villain. With the help of his friends and Leafa who turns out to be his sister, they find Asuna and rescue her. This plot was incredible. They effectivly tell a story of love and also a fight for survival.  Even though it's somehow the classic boy saves girl, it's still so much more and the end of every episode leaves you wanting more. The plot is effective in the sense that the writers have based this of a novel/manga and still made it so unique in so many ways.
The art was great! For the era the anime was produced the art is top notch although if you have a good eye you could spot some little flaws in some scenes. Each character and their actions are drawn with perfection and even though sometimes they move at very fast speeds, the quality doesn't suffer and maintains a careful balance of skill and detail in each drawing.
The sounds were outstanding. They had no cliché, overused sounds at all. All of it, for me, was crystal clear and original. Each character sounded different so even when you're only listening to them you know exactly who is talking. The intro and outro songs were super. I don't know if they were made specially for SAO but the lyrics really helped describe the character's feelings and their surroundings.
The characters were very good. Their personalities were all different yet somehow I found that they were familiar (like they were from a different anime I watched) which is why I ranked Character with an 8. Each character has their own emotions and a high level of originality which clearly shows and anyone who has seen SAO, I'm sure they would agree with me on that one. 
The enjoyment I got from watching SAO was outstanding. I only wish they had made more. They managed to fit in two plots in one series and still made it feel like it wasn't rushed to be completed. It was also a very clean anime too. They didn't use huge boobs and fan service in every episode to keep viewers. The enjoyment that someone gets from this is pure and really makes them want to keep watching to find out what happens next.
Overall I give SAO a 9. It was exhilarating every step of the way and I would give anything for a 1 or 2 more seasons. I would absolutely recommend this anime to all anime fans out there who haven't seen SAO and need something to watch.",9
"
                I originally was inspired by SAO the visual novel into playing Eve Online, where things were almost like a simulation of real life consequences. In terms of the anime, I felt it was a good companion to those that have read the VN. Those that didn't read the VN, had some interesting, though erroneous, interpretations of the story and characters. That is a direct effect of the anime adaptation.
There were definitely some issues with the ending and pacing, although from an adaptation viewpoint, it was adapted straight in from the VN, with the exception of the timeline. The short story episodes from 1-6 were after
                  the epic arc conclusion, not before. Even though timewise they happened before.
Each short story or episode was it were, had its own beginning, middle, and conclusion. Perhaps because people didn't see where Kirito ended up or some of the life problems of people in the game world, they didn't pay as much attention to the details as they should have. Since the first novel was only given 13 eps, there probably wasn't a lot of time to go through the interconnections. Things may have been easier to interpret if the first novel were 26 eps long.
I can definitely say though that the anime brought out the spirit of SAO, and was definitely enjoyable, irregardless of the flaws. It helps to know how the characters are developed before hand, however.
The reason why I say people weren't paying attention is because some see the two main characters as ideal portrayals. Even though by the end of the story, they had changed significantly enough to become what they were. From my viewpoint, there was a great amount of character changing and development, yet to many, there was not. I find that strange because while this split in interpretation would make perfect sense if the anime had left out some fundamental events, except the anime didn't leave out those fundamental events at all. In fact, one is given more of a backstory to see the main characters historical experiences, than what I read in the first novel.
An anti social lone wolf would never have been able to have a real relationship with others in a game he felt wasn't part of the real world. In fact, Kirito originally played the game because the real world, of emotions and consequences, were too much for him to handle. Yet he ended up with the hopes and dreams of so many people on his shoulders, some we saw in the beginning episodes, others are are only mentioned in passing.
Those who are charged with power and responsibility, must not avert their eyes to the consequences of reality nor to the necessity of getting blood on their hands in doing the work that needs to be done. While the anime didn't have the benefit of many of the internal monologues, I cannot help but think that this content and reality should have shone through nonetheless given how all the events and real life consequences were shown.
Two people who were loners and beholden to the limits of Japanese society, were able to break down their own walls to reach other in a partnership of mutual benefit, the very definition of marriage. If the anime was short, the novel was almost as short. The events should still have carried most of the meaning.
Of course, my perhaps sole benefit is that I already admired the characters because of what they had gone through before the anime. That one change in my point of view, is perhaps the leading difference. People will not pay attention to that which they think frivolous or unimportant. But in doing so, they are unable to see another character's point of view as well.
The main characters are perhaps hard to understand because most humans expect to see a reaction and when they don't, they cannot put themselves into the character's shoes. Because to hold the weight and value of the lives of others, while killing humans, is not something mmo players or normal civilians are most familiar with. The fantasy of a tv show can't do much to bridge that gap. Else everyone would have watched Legend of the Galactic Heroes already.",8

                In the instant I saw this anime I loved this anime I loved this anime and found myself waiting for he new episodes to appear every week.. I'm not a great reviewer so I can only get straight to my point. As a anime, I'll rate SAO by 6 out of 10. If it's not for the LN itself, I'll rate it 4 or even 2. The only good things in the anime is the song and graphic as I found it refreshing and beautiful, regardless what people said. But the main reason I write this review is that most of reviewer here said the
                  worst thing is the character development and insufficient character depth. I agreed with that because I read the LN. It's surprising that i read it from the first book until the tenth (currently waiting for the eleventh book) only in one week. In the LN itself the character depth may be multiplied by two. As you can see, anime itself focuses in its visual and audio side, so it lacks the literal explanation and many more character monologues that happened inside their mind I can't even begin to count of. In fact a mere 30 second of the anime may consume a whole chapter of the LN. As my review get further an further out of the main topic, I'd like to say he main point. If you wanted to fully enjoy the anime I suggest you to read he LN first and then watch the anime. As the LN lacks he imagination support, the anime will complete it, and as the anime lacks the literal explanation (usually it's about the background of certain thing currently discussed) the LN will fulfill it. Thank you for anyone'a attention. Sorry if there are some typo because I'm currently writing for my touchscreen gadget I'm not comfortable witch. And mainly I'm sorry if my review is not an appropriate review as I discussed the LN mainly, forgive me as this I the first time I write a review. And I'm sorry for my bad grammar too. Thank you",6
"
                Gamers get stuck in a video game and must beat all the levels to get out. Great premise, and it seems that it was the only thing that was great with this anime.
Everything else just sucks.
Characters? Male MC is a handsome, strong, smart, kindhearted, basically perfect that every girl he meets falls in love with him. Pathetic. Female MC is a beautiful, strong, smart, has high position in game society, wife material, basically perfect too. Which is terrible too. Main villain is guy whose motives weren't clear (basically just whatever, felt like it).
Romance? Most badly written romance in my life. They were trying to make
                  a romantic comedy but the romance was basically fulfilled already early in the show. How? It wasn't shown! One ep they hate each other, next ep they already love each other somehow, next few eps they are already adults with a kid already. Author doesn't know how to write romance, or characters, at all. And to mention that they are also trying to make a harem. But unfortunately the other girls only last one or two eps and basically don't give any significance to the plot or the characters' development at all. The romance was rushed, forced, tacked on, and overall cringeworthy.
Plot? The premise of being in a hard coded programmed game is basically tacked on, ignored, and pretty much disrespected. It's almost like a generic fighting fantasy anime. Which isn't bad but it defeats the purpose of the gaming premise. Seriously, being able to live through sheer willpower is acceptable in ""real life"" fantasy anime but in a game anime it's just plain disrespect to it. There will be a few MMO gaming references that some might enjoy. But mostly, the gaming premise is either nonexistent or disrespected.
Visuals and music weren't bad at least, but they hardly matter when the plot and characters are basically shit-tier terrible.
Find a better anime to watch than this. I watched until the half of Season 3 because my IRL friends watch this anime too, but honestly it even gets worse; yes, somehow that was even possible. I would strongly recommend against wasting your time watching this anime.",1
"
                When I first heard of this anime, everything was glossed over. My friends all told me it was the most amazing thing they've ever watched- and naturally, I believed them. So I began this anime, and I suppose it was pretty decent at first. As I went along, however, things certainly took a turn 
downhill.
** MILD SPOILERS BELOW **
Story: 5
The story, in all honesty, was a hit and miss. At least, the first season was. Either you enjoy watching harems or you don't enjoy watching harems. The first season cruises along somewhat smoothly, though there were a few plot holes here and there. The ending
                  of the first arc was almost predictable, however, which was rather disappointing.
And then comes the second arc.
The second arc involved a sudden switching of protagonists, which honestly ruined many things. Character personalities were totally dumped upside down, and Asuna, who was one of the strongest in the original SAO game, becomes the weak, timid damsel in distress. More random girls are added to the queue, and before you know it, a full on harem has broken out. Kirito doesn't even mind the obvious flirting despite having a girlfriend. In addition, the plot, by this point, has become extremely predictable. Despite this, however, I can see why some people may enjoy the story of this anime despite the cliches that it contains. As I said before, SAO is a hit or miss. Either you like this type of plot or you don't.
Art: 8
Okay, so the art was definitely very well done. It is, perhaps, the best aspect of this anime, in my opinion at the very least. The animations were smooth- and compared to many of the anime that came out during the same season, they were much better. The color scheme suited moods that came up, and the characters' expressions were beautifully drawn. Unfortunately, many other aspects of the anime ruined the artwork.
Sound: 7
The sound was also very well off overall. The background music was above average, and the voice actors clearly did a very good job on bringing their characters to life. Sound effects were certainly affective, and were placed in at reasonable volumes.
Character: 4
Character development was very very subtle- or there was none at all. The only characters that I saw undergo any growth was Kirito and a bit for Asuna. In Kirito's case, he learns to get over his fear of joining guilds and comes to understand teamwork- but in all honesty, this internal struggle was small and not very impacting on the anime. As for Asuna, she learns to not take everything very seriously and to enjoy herself even if she is living in a ""false"" reality- but after a couple of episodes, it's almost as if this struggle never even existed. 
In arc 2,Suguha also had her own internal struggle- and that was the only one that really seemed to actually drive a story. Yet by the end of the arc, she seems to disregard the things that she has learned, continuing her behavior around Kirito as usual.
Enjoyment: 4
I stated this before, and I will say it again: this anime is either hit or miss. In my case, it was a miss, as I am not particularly fond of harems. However, there were still aspects of this anime that were quite enjoyable- I refer mainly to the art and sound quality. While I didn't enjoy the story all that much, I admit that there was a time when I shipped Kirito and Asuna quite hard, which is why I quite liked the moments that they had- but I digress. If you enjoy watching harems just for fun, then go ahead and watch this anime. I'd recommend it to you.
Overall: 6
The anime was alright overall, I suppose. I feel like perhaps I would have enjoyed it better if so many friends hadn't told me about how perfect it was, because that only made me have heightened expectations for the anime. There were many inconsistencies and things that could have been improved, but if you are searching for pure entertainment, then go ahead and give it a shot.
Thank you for reading~",6

                People hate Sword Art Online for it promised something different than what it offered. Although originally the story appears to be straightforward--like many other shounen anime, Sword Art Online is very subtle in its explanations. The problems are caused mainly by the time skips, as people forget that they occurred about four episodes into the show. This caused many people to see characters as ""unrealistic"" or rushed.
Hate that Sword Art Online receives is often generated from what many people believed it offered. Initially, Sword Art Online appears to address the question of how a society functions outside of reality--inside a game; however, this is not
                  entirely true. While it cannot be seen in the first few arcs, Sword Art Online's overall theme is not about what happens to a group of people who are living inside a game, but rather it is about what happens to those people when they get thrust back into reality. Unfortunately, the anime stopped the story short, and this plot was never addressed.
Also, Sword Art Online is very subtle in its explanations. Don't watch this anime and expect it to give a reason explicitly like traditional shounen anime. Answers are there, but they are touched upon thereby forcing the viewer to fill in the gaps. These gaps, however, are not large. In fact, actively watching and closely paying attention will make these jumps very simple.
In conclusion, Sword Art Online is a very enjoyable anime; however, it is neither a turn off your brain and watch show nor a sit down and discuss the implications of the plot show (as of this point at least). Instead, it is a show that forces the viewer to focus and to think, despite its generic appearance.",9
"
                After completing sword art online, one thing popped into my mind. WOW. This was one of the most enjoyable shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. In fact, SAO was one of the first animes I have ever watched. All of the characters were unique and fun, the art was top notch, and all of the ops and ending themes are still stuck in my head. The animation was eye catching and was well suited for all of the massive fight scenes going on. The story had it all, action, adventure, romance and even some comedy. When I first decided to watch the
                  show, I hoped that it wasn't overrated, but it lived up to all my expectations. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of watching SAO, the you are in for a treat!",10

                god awful, traumatized me, never seen an anime this garbo. Fan service where it should not have been, way to into incest, bad writing overall w/ bad pacing, needless fights and above all else horrible characters. They butchered Asuna's character and the MC is boring as. Don't waste your time, go watch a better anime. I hated every second I watched it, please please do not waste your time. The fight scenes are mediocre at best, the op is overhyped, its a romance anime? Even the side characters make me wanna rip off my scalp. Just go watch a better anime

                       Sword Art Online is near and dear to me considering it was my first anime that I've ever sat down and binge-watched to it's completion. I watched it in 7th grade with my mother and i'll never forget that experience, however on second re-watch I can't help but find myself extremely disappointed. Also I used to be one of those kids that thought people disliked SAO because of it's popularity and just hated on it because everyone was hating on it, now I understand everyone's criticisms and I'm here to bring mine to light. I've seen Sword Art
                  Online, and Sword Art Online II to it's completion, however I'm only going to be discussing the Aincrad arc since it was the only part that I recently re-watched because the other arcs get even worse. Also spoilers ahead, let's get into it shall we?
     Where do I even begin? For this review I'm gonna talk about everything from best to worst. The music in this anime is truly something special. From the opening, to the ending, to the songs played during moments. Each track was great and I often found myself zoning out while listening to them. The art in this anime is also superb, the world itself feels alive it feels like things are happening, the sceneries and landscapes look really good and unique, it's just really nice to look at. Voice acting and sound design are pretty much what you'd expect, nothing to ride home about but definitely not bad. I fairly enjoyed the first half of the season, although there's glaring issues there as well, I can say that on re-watch I wasn't bored watching the first half. Kirito's first steps into this world as a solo player venturing with different groups and players was kind of interesting, at first at least. Sachi and Klein being my favorite characters got a decent amount of screen-time in the first half and I can't really explain why I like them, I just didn't dread them in the scenes they were in. And that concludes everything I like about Sword Art Online, I hate to rip my first anime into shreds, but it's inevitable when you put out this garbage. Let's dive in.
Logic and worldbuilding plotholes in anime can be overlooked, for me at least. If a show is entertaining enough, I can put that aside, to just sit down and enjoy an entertaining show. The problem is SAO's logic and worldbuilding flaws often destroys the entertainment. Hell, everything in this goddamn show often destroys the entertainment. Kirito and Asuna make HORROR MOVIE PROTAGONIST DUMB DECISIONS. And while making these stupid decisions, the show makes Kirito appear as a smartass always figuring out every single thing like he's an ace detective in this world. Asuna protects these kids in episode 12 from this knight guild and beats the shit out of one. Later on, the leader of that knight guild comes to Kirito and Asuna and asks for help saving her friend stuck in a dungeon. Any human being with an IQ level of 2 would think that this is a TERRIBLE IDEA. Especially given the fact that treacherous activity is known to be popular in this world. That's like someone's best friend coming up to you asking for help after you kicked the shit out of his/her best friend. But of course, Asuna and Kirito agree! This doesn't just ruin this sequence from a logical standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint as well. We spend the majority of the episode looking for her friend and fighting this high level monster in the dungeon and it just feels utterly pointless. Why are we here, why did we agree to help, why is this a better idea than spending quality time together or helping the clearing team. Who knows! Afterwards we get Yui backstory, and pretty much an entire episode dedicated to her creating a cycle of sighs while i was watching. She's not interesting in any way, they introduced her so poorly into the story and her backstory felt so misplaced, I just didn't care at all. Blue haired leader guy dying in episode 2 makes absolutely NO SENSE. He gives this pointless speech instead of drinking the potion Kirito is trying to give him. This scene looks even stupider when you look at the scene where Kirito is about to die and Asuna gives him a potion and he instantly drinks it like any person with half a brain cell would do. The final sequence/ending of the season is one of the worst endings I've ever seen. The duel itself was okay? This is a good time really quickly go over the animation and the fight scenes which is what you look for in a show like this that doesn't make logical sense. However they managed to make the fights look mediocre as well. Most of the time you'd see them reuse the same slash animation and camera misdirection, Kirito just swings his swords rapidly and then even faster, that's it. However I did enjoy the duel against Heathcliff at the arena. Back to the final sequence, Asuna SOMEHOW MAGICALLY recovers from her paralysis when the game creator himself didn't code a way for that to be possible. It just happened, no explanation at all. She then takes a shot for Kirito and dies. We later see that she's alive. How is this possible?? Everyone that died prior in the same fucking room is said to be dead yet somehow Asuna is the one that survives, once again no explanation. Kirito also gets killed, and somehow comes back to life and kills Heathcliff?? HOW. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? The game creator himself didn't understand how that was possible, did the game have a glitch? Oddly convenient am i right. It would've made perfect sense if Klein threw the ressurection potion Kirito gave him and said something like ""I told you not to die asshole"" and revived him and he then proceeded to kill Heathcliff. Asuna and Kirito ask Kayaba why he did what he did. Basically the villain's motives which is the most important feature about a villain that makes them good and unique. He doesn't answer why he did it at all, he just rambles about shit that has nothing to do with the question. It doesn't stop there. The worst part of it all is that he didn't even ask how Kirito managed to COME BACK TO LIFE AND KILL HIM. Maybe he didn't care? Even then this point needs to be explained to the audience how that was possible. I believe the reason we didn't get an explanation is because THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION. The explanation never existed, it just happened and we're supposed to move on.
I haven't discussed Kirito or Asuna themselves as characters because there's no point in doing so. They have pretty basic personalities and what defines their characters as bad falls under the lines of bad story-telling. Their relationship makes no sense at all. We don't really see their relationship build, they go from putting up with each other, to being friendly, to being deeply in love. Which I can kind of excuse because there was an absurd amount of time-skips so I guess we're supposed to believe is when they ""fell in love."" But we the audience didn't see even a glimpse of that development. In the second half of the season they spend every single moment together which logically makes sense if you're deeply in love with someone and you don't know how long you and your partner have left in this life or death world. But we didn't see ANY of that, to us the audience, or at least to me, I still have the mindset as they're just warming up to each other becoming friends. So seeing an entire mini-arc of them going on a vacation together and finding a way to make every scene romantic and spending every single scene together was just utter cringe! Back on the topic of time-skips, there was WAY TOO MANY in this season. I'm not sure if this was done specifically for the anime to cut out manga content but it was a terrible idea. This arc should be at least 25 episodes and as I said in the beginning I'm covering from best to worst so we're heading into absolute shit territory. Time-skips happen almost every episode it feels like, and they also happen at the most random times. After Kirito's guild-mates get killed by the treasure chest trap, BOOM TIME-SKIP. We don't even see Kirito's emotional reaction, nor do we see how he gets out of there alive. As Kirito goes to retrieve the ressurection potion from the monster, it just skips to after he's already killed it, we don't even see the fight. This affects the main plot even more. I really liked the concept of the plot, but the plot isn't even important in this season. Yes you read that correctly, the main plot is irrelevant in this season. 90% of the time I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT FLOOR THE CLEARING TEAM IS ON. We get references in conversations about the clearing team but they don't even mention what floor we've made it to. We see the Floor 1 boss fight, then the next boss fight we see is in the sixties?? WHY ARE WE SKIPPING THROUGH THE MAIN CONCEPT OF THE STORY? After that we get the Floor 75 boss and then fuck the other floors, we fight the Floor 100 boss on that floor. 
Kirito being overpowered makes no sense. I'm sure a lot of you were waiting for this one and I've saved it for last. Him being overpowered with no context doesn't just hurt the show from a logical standpoint, but an entertainment standpoint as well, and I'll explain why. Kirito's level during the time-skips increases, obviously since there's time-skips. Also take a shot everytime I've said time-skip. Not ONCE do we see any sort of training from Kirito for the entire season. We just see his level increase by 20 everytime we see his hp bar with no context. Part of a character's development and growth is training not even in just action animes. Without the training sequences in Demon Slayer's beginning episodes we wouldn't have a feel for Tanjiro's power level and see him grow as a Demon Slayer. We don't see Kirito grow at all, majority of the time we don't even know his power level, we just know he's overpowered as fuck. Even just a training montage would've been SOMETHING but we couldn't even get that, a montage sequence for Kirito and Asuna's relationship growth also would've been nice, but we didn't get that either. We're just supposed to believe Kirito is this fucking good at this game because why? Because he is. This hurts the viewing experience because we don't even understand our main protagonist, every scene is focused around him and we don't even know how he obtained this power level. This affects the tension of the entire season. Not once, and I mean not once, did I fear that Kirito would die or lose a fight during the entire season. The only time he ""lost"" was when the game creator was cheating. Having fights with no tension, is like having sex with no feeling. I'M EMOTIONLESS DURING THE FIGHTS. I can't root for a character that I know is going to win every fight, a character can't grow without facing defeat. Kirito doesn't know defeat, technically you could make the argument his defeat was watching his guild friends die in the chest room which ultimately makes him more determined but my point still stands. There is no tension in fights, which is something you can't have in an anime focused around fights. This could be excusable if the animation and the fights looked really cool and stylish. BUT THEY DONT, they're mediocre at best.
I've done enough bullying for one day. I really wish I could take back my decision of re-watching it because it sorta tarnished my childhood memory of it. But I still can say I kinda enjoyed my time probably because of the friend I was watching it with. Which even she recognized the faults on first watch. It's not the worst anime I've ever seen, but it's definitely not ""good"". This is probably the most I've had to say talking about an anime ever because it really saddens me to see my childhood show be so disappointing. It still holds a special place in my heart and my childhood nostalgia won't allow me to give it anything lower than a 4. Maybe it was deserving of a 3 but I do have to keep in mind that I wasn't necessarily bored during the first half, and that concludes my thoughts. Like this review or you're a beater. :p",4
"
                This anime is quite interesting due to its unique setting...
Some people harshly judge it because the main character is a shut in whose got  every girl in the anime to fall in love with him. Which can never happen to shut in's because they are  who doesn't have much experience in dealing with people so they can't be as cool as the main character was portrayed.
STORY:
Very good idea and very attractive setting so 10/10
ART: 
Good but not the best I've seen so i'll give it an 8/10
CHARACTERS:
Most of the characters are not very original except maybe the main character is smart, strong,loner and
                  a little bad ass which makes it interesting. I hate animes with weak-willed main characters;you know ; the type who are weak, naive, stupid but they get stronger and then they want to save everybody and not hurt anyone....it's too unrealistic.. And that is exactly why i found the main character attractive for mostly he was the exact opposite of most anime protagonist.
ENJOYMENT:
Although the story was very good but towards the end somehow i started loosing my patience but still i enjoyed it more than many dozens of anime.. so it gets a 9/10.
OVERALL: 9/10",9

                0Emo guy gets trapped in a vrmmorpg (virtual reality massive multi-player online role playing game) and has to beat the boss to get out or die.
Story: 5/10 
I wish I could say it was more than what's above but honestly, it's not. The idea of being stuck in a video do or die is unoriginal and the story does little to compensate for that. It had a lot of potential and could have deserved all the attention it got but unfortunately imo it didn't. The first two episodes got me hooked, it started out GREAT. Kirito starts playing SAO, meeting a new friend and then
                  bam he finds out that he can't log out and it was all a scheme from the game maker. Everyone has to beat the game or die. But all of a sudden he decides to go solo (in a mmo ? -.-)because everyone thinks hes a cheater for being a beta tester. Instead of explaining that he didn't know about the first boss because it changed, he walks out. That's where things start to go downhill because the pacing suddenly gets rushed and uneeded characters are put in to traumatize Kirito and make the story seem meaningful or something. In reality it doesn't really change him because hes already all depressed to start with. Some episodes seemed like fillers to me where they could have done something to contribute to the story but it just ends up as another episode where a girl falls in love with Kirito then pretty much gets thrown in the trash can because they're just extras. A one time kind of thing. I honestly thought the second half was very unnecessary. Instead of suddenly skipping from floor 1 to floor 50 then (You know) they could have used the 25 episodes to fill in some plot holes and make the series seem not so rushed. Since they didn't it probably would have been better to end it at episode 14. That's how unnecessary i thought the second half was.
Characters 5/10:
You got your average unconfident 15 year old (or was he 14?) guy who likes to play video games. I know, how special, well that special guy is our MC. Magnificent.  He's gloomy most of the time, pretty kind and at desperate moments can be really cheesy. Unfortunately he pretty much stays like that throughout the whole series. Then you got our typical Tsundere Asuna who falls in love with him just like 70% of the cast does. She's doing all the things Tsundere's do. Act mean, then nice. Cool. After that comes a girl named Silicia who falls in love with him for doing a good deed and we don't see her till like 15 eps later. Great. The rest of the supports are pretty much like that. Awesome. Except for that red haired guy. Yeah i dont remember his name because he appeared in like 2 episodes and came back 15 episodes later for 30 secs. Fascinating. Oh yeah you can't forget about Suguha. Kirito's cousin who has a crush on him (not creepy at all), has double g boobs (oh la la la this is not a complaint) and likes to create uneeded drama(but this is -.-). Magnificent. Lastly our villain in the second half. Im not even going to start because you all know what villains like to do. Capture the MC's loved ones then wait to be defeated by the MC. Amazing. Maybe im being a bit harsh on the characters because despite not developing much they were pretty enjoyable especially Asuna and Kirito's romance but overall just not great. For being entertaining i give them a 7, for being characters i give them a 5.
Art: The art is actually very good well it was made in 2012. So no duh but still. The landscapes were like dum bee do bee dum. All medieval fairytale like which is good because that's the whole point. No weird hair (game characters dont count those are cool CX), 5 meter long legs and cool video game outfits. What more could you ask for? 9/10
Soundtrack 8/10: I really liked the soundtrack. I usually skip the openings and endings but for SAO i listened to it twice (well its better than nothing). What i liked most was the whimsical music that made it seem like a fairytale. It was awesome. Some of the battle music could have been more epic but its battle music who cares as long as it builds suspense.
Enjoyment 7/10: Despite all my critism i actually liked SAO i mean when im watching anime im not in critic node im in my weird kaelynn self mode (basically childish mode) :P The characters are really entertaining and watching Asuna's + Kirito's romance is also enjoyable (Even though i dont really like romance) . Best thing is when scenes go over the top with being dramatic and end up being cheesy, you get a good laugh. If you just want some entertainment watch SAO or if you don't care about plotholes n all that reviewing stuff. If you're just a strict wuss then shoo! lol jk.. this is long. phew.",7

                Sword Art Online ( aka SAO )  is a Action, Romance, Fantasy, Game and Adventure anime. This is one of the anime that you ether like or dislike.The main character in SAO his name is Kirito. I personally thought that Sword Art Online wasn't bad, but it could of been better. Sword Art Online season 1 plot was alright. The plot was a good idea, but I felt that they could of made it better. Sword Art Online season 2 plot was great. I thought it was well thought and how much it has changed from the first season. The music was great. It
                  was catchy and it fitted the anime really well. The ship of SAO was alright, it was cliche, but I personally like cliche ships. They could of made the ship have more feels to it. Overall I gave this a anime 7/10.",8

                This review is pretty long, but I just had to.
I've always wanted to write a review for this anime because it gave me so many feels when I finished it. I started this anime with so many high expectations from all the good reviews and by the time I finished it (the next day), I felt empty in a way. 
It was either that I had really really enjoyed it and didn't want it to end... or I wasn't satisfied with the ending. 
I don't know how to explain this; I mean I wasn't particularly disappointed in the anime. It was great actually! The first
                  arc was awesome but then something's just not right. 
That's why I've decided to write a review to this anime. It has spoilers... so if you don't want to get spoiled, stop reading. :)
Story - 7
Okay so the story isn't very unique. Technically it's about people being trapped inside a world where they have to fight to get out. Even though it's not special, I really like this concept and therefore I really enjoyed the first arc.
However I would have liked it more if the SAO arc didn't end so bluntly. One minute they were fighting a boss the next minute the leader of the strongest guild was the bad guy all along. This is proof that this anime is way too fast. People need time to process important information such as this  and SAO isn't the best at doing this. 
Well they did gave off SOME hints that he was the bad guy but it wasn't as clear. It is a good thing to have a sudden twist in the story and surprise the audience, but SAO should give the audience a chance to figure out who the bad guy is. Maybe Kirito could just say to Asuna, or just simply think to himself that Kayaba Akihiko might be among the players so that it could build up a bit of suspense so that later we, the audience, won't feel so empty. In other words, they skipped the built-up stage and rushed straight to the climax. IN A STORY, DO NOT EVER DO THIS!
Okay so that's the first arc. Second arc: horrible really. :)
It's not mainly because of the story, it's because of the character (yes, i'm pointing my finger at Suguha). The fact that they're using fighting fairies is really awesome! Now they can fly and they belong to different realms (is that what they called it?). They can also use spells and magic! It had so much potential...
The timing was better. The story of rescuing Asuna is good as well. Kirito meeting Leafa is also good. 
I was disappointed when Kirito lost his title: The Black Swordman. He became nothing in ALO, which is sad.
The ending was too far stressed in my opinion. The part where the guy raped Asuna with Kirito watching, it seemed like a really good love story. With the guy feeling pain at nothing he can do for the girl he loves when she is raped right in front of him. It really tugs your heart. But SAO isn't like that. They had sex before, but it was out of love. This guy is raping her out of enjoyment. It has no point he doesn't love her! He's just doing it so Kirito can feel the pain. There are many ways they (he) could have expressed that. Kissing her is enough. Touching her hair is enough. Touching her face is enough. Tying her up is enough. Locking her in a cage is enough. For Pete's sake he is ENGAGE to her! Raping is too far fetched. 
And that's all I have to say.
Art - 9
It's beautiful. Especially SAO! I think on the first episode, most of the settings are based on real locations. The character is very nice as well! But I personally thought that Asuna's face is kind of too round... She's still pretty though.
Sound - 8
I don't remember much (watched it last year), but I think I enjoyed the opening songs. Couldn't remember the endings though... But there's this theme called Gracefully. If you loved SAO (or hated...) check it out because it's beautiful! It will trigger memories!

Character - 6
This is where things go horribly wrong. I will be assessing main characters and the ones I liked. 
Kirito
SAO - He's too perfect. He is this well-known swordsman who is super powerful with the name ""The Black Swordman"". He's handsome, nice, knows how to enjoy things, knows what to do, unbeatable at fighting, solves the mystery, and gets the girl. He's just perfect. Nobody is ever perfect, so Kirito is a very unrealistic character. 
But for me, that's okay. I mean he's in a game. He's stuck in a fake world, a world where he prefers being in than the real world. So when I read the reviews about him being too perfect, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. The world is unreal; his personality doesn't need to be real. 
My point is expressed by episode 6, where that guy killed his wife because she was too different (can't remember names, sorry...). The person she was in real life is different than the person she was in the game; it showed a different side of her that the husband never knew. This is the same for Kirito, and this is also where his character goes down. We barely know what Kirito is like in the real world. 
He is a gamer, so because of this we can safely say that he doesn't have much friends. From SAO, he is too straightforward and other people see this as rude - people like Lisbeth. It shows that his communication and social skills are very bad. Since he's a gamer, we can also deduce that he is somewhat a genius. In SAO, he was able to crack the system and save Yui from being deleted. 
And that's all we know about Kirigaya Kazuto-san. The traits I said he had was only assumptions, we're unclear if he had any friends in real life. How his grades were doing. What his relationship with his family was. Nothing. And that is Kirito's character's flaws. 
ALO - So he became from this awesome swordsman to a looked-down-on fairy. And he was able to proof to Leafa and others that he was worth something. I liked his personality in ALO better since he went from Hero, to Zero, to Hero again. 
How he is so determined to rescue Asuna is very strong as well. It shows a character development from where he was 'the lone ranger' and only cared for himself to a person who would risk getting killed to protect someone he cares about. As a result, Asuna is THE most important character for Kirito's character development. Not only does he change from that, but also his social skills. He befriended Leafa quite easily compared to when he was with Asuna, Sachi, Klein and Lisbeth (he saved Silica's life... so let's ignore her for now). 
In ALO, we were also able to take a look at Kazuto's life. The relationship between him and his sister and that he used to do Kendo. 
In the end, between SAO and ALO he had a massive character development.
Asuna
SAO - Likewise to Kirito, her character is also perfect. But she wasn't perfect from the start. From the start she was just a lonely girl who didn't know much about the game, the next time we saw her on screen she was the sub-leader of the best guild in SAO. We didn't see it, but we know that she had to work extremely hard to get into such a high position (how she mastered her cooking was the same, she worked hard). 
She is also very determined and knows exactly what to do since she is a leader.
Unlike Kirito, Asuna is not perfect from the beginning. She was rather clumsy and confused. From where she was standing up until now, she had a great character development. 
She's also a Tsundere and had a soft spot for Kirito and she makes people do the things she wants through force. She is also very hard working, too hard-working sometimes and forget to enjoy her life. So even though she was perfect, she wasn't that perfect. 
Though a character like her is very unrealistic, she is very inspirational. She is strong and doesn't need Kirito to save her she actually saved him. Twice (ignore ALO for now). 
But thinking about it we don't know anything about Asuna in the real world either, however this is not necessary. We watch SAO in the perspective of Kirito, so we only know the stuff that Kirito knows and the stuff when he is around. They showed Asuna's personality very clear and we do have an idea what kind of person she is.
In general, I thought Asuna was a great character in SAO. In SAO...
ALO - In ALO, we know a bit about her. She is the daughter of a rich cooperation and she's getting engaged. I think there was some other information about her but I forgot... :P
Anyway in ALO, she was locked up in a cage. Disappointing because I wanted to see her fight side by side with Kirito like in SAO. Not only that but she suddenly changed: from the hero to the princess. And this change, in my opinion, is really stupid.
We got to know her in SAO as an independent being and can take care of herself fine. But here in ALO she couldn't do anything. From SAO, I know that she can take the Oberon guy (the guy that raped her) head on. He's a weakling; we saw how frightened he was when Kirito got the upper hand of things. The fact is that Asuna is even stronger than Kirito (mentally, not physically), why didn't they get her to beat the lights out of him? That would be so much better.
I read in a review that the author to SAO wrote this when he was 15, so it's understandable that sometimes he wants guys to be the powerful ones and girls to be the weaker ones. He should either have just shown that Asuna was weak or that the cage was impossible to get out of for her not to fight back. So yes, I am not happy with ALO's Asuna.
Suguha/Leafa
She's my least favorite character. She doesn't do anything when she's with Kirito really. He does most of the work and she heals him. 
I don't like her at all. Not because I support Asuna & Kirito, but because she doesn't seem likeable.  She is nothing like Asuna. They're both kind of arrogant, but at least Asuna shows us what she can do. Leafa stood on the side and cheered the whole time. 
Oh, and did I mention that she is incest? Well there you have it. She's incest. And after falling in love with her brother (cousin) again in the game and realized he was her brother, she cried in her room blaming him. 
He never did anything wrong. All he did was being nice! He didn't know she was in love with him in real life or that she was his sister in the game. 
She's just so messed up that I almost feel sorry for her. Almost.
She also uses the person who likes her... God I can't stand her.
So that's the main character. I've noticed that this review is getting too long so I'm going to sum up the rest of the characters. For me I like Yui and Klein. They were the best characters (better than Asuna and Kirito). 
Lisbeth and Silica was nice as well. Though because the pace was too fast they couldn't explore more into Lisbeth, Silica and Sachi. I would have liked Kirito to spend a longer time than just one episode for each character and then the rest is based on Asuna.
Enjoyment - 9
Finished it the next day. I don't do that very often. 
Overall - 7
It was good. Maybe an 8? nah...
Well back to my point earlier, I felt empty after finishing the anime. I think not because I wanted more, but I wanted it to make more sense. And I think the ending to the whole series wasn't very powerful. The bad guy in ALO is actually quite weak, and it took that long to defeat him is really stupid. I guess the main point of ALO is to introduce Leafa and show us the bond between Kirito and his sister. But it was still very weak, even at the reunion of Asuna and Kirito. 
So yeah... I guess I was disappointed. :|",7
"
                Alright, SAO is every boy/man's and poissibly girl/woman's dream. To be trapped inside a virtual world, where you must fight to survive. The protagonist, Kirito, along with 10.000 other players are trapped in a virtual world. If they die in-game, their real-world brain is fried, so they go kaput in real life too.The reason they are trapped in this death game is not explained  (remember that) and they have no communications with the outside world whatsoever. The protagonist, being a beta tester and a very good MMO player does practically solo the game at first (and sometimes later on) while meeting other players etc
                  etc. 
Now there are three things that are important: One, the manga writer AND the animators have clearly played MMOs before and that offers for quite realistic terms, situations etc etc. 2) The anime belongs mainly on the romance gender, the protagonist falls in complete love with the typical dynamic maiden-in-distress, Asuna, and ends up ""sigh"" marrying her in-game. Before point 3 it should be noted that he clearly shows preferrence to her. 3)Despite being a romance anime the anime does try to follow the harem route, progressively adding more girls that get at most 1-2 episodes screentime with the protagonist and falling for him (notable harem positions missing: The trap, the maid and the loli. Arguably Silica could be called a loli but since she's actually only 13 years old I wouldn't put her in that category.) 
One of the biggest blows for me, before the first half of the anime ended (and before everyone got greed from Sword Art Online), the protagonist has a talk with the creator of SAO, Kayaba Akihiko. Remember what I told you to keep in mind? That it was never explained why he did it? Well when the protagonist asks that question to him the answer we are getting is: ""It's been so long, I don't remember myself anymore"" and the protagonist moves on to ask the next question. HOLD ON A MINUTE. This isn't some minor character we're talking about here! This is literally the main villain, the big bad. You can't just get away with a ""Oh g, I wonder why?""!
The second half of the anime, ALO (alfheim online) focuses on a second mmo, created from the engine of the first. This time however, with the exception of the protagonist's primary girlfriend, Asuna, noone is trapped. When the protagonist hears that the typical corporate soulless bastard will marry the unconcious body of his ""true love"" before they unhook the life-support plug, he rushes to ALO, where there is a chance that Asuna might still be trapped. Now comes the second major flow of the anime, which did also exist in the first half, but there at least it could be explained by the fact that their lives depended on it. Even random people who are free to go in-and-out of ALO whenever they like take the game WAYYYYYY TOO SERIOUSLY.And I do mean TOO seriously. They hold offline meetings to discuss how they should proceed online, make it sound like a character dying would be something serious whereas that character will simply respawn 1 minute later and so on. 
In this arc some spotlight is given to Kirito's sister who also has a thing for him (someone! tick the incest point off the harem list) trying to go for the dual female lead (that if I'm not mistaken baka to test began as a major trend first), but that fails as Kirito still only cares for our main female lead, Asuna. As to why it fails... Well 1) Asuna is the maiden-in-distress seeing as how she needs to be rescued whereas the sister can jut log off whenever she likes. 2) Asuna is prettier in appearance beyond comparison.
Oh yeah, soundtrack and animation are awesome.",7

                After hearing much about the highly-acclaimed SAO, I decided to watch it. The main reason I watched it was because of the relationship between the main protagonists. However, the concept of the virtual gaming world was ruined by romance. The first few episodes were very promising: action, fights, duel, and personally my favorite, a strong heroine. However, as the series progresses, all of that is lost. It became a fan-service series, which was really disappointing because the concept of being trapped in a virtual world could be expanded better.

                Sword Art Online is one of my favorite animes of all time! It isn't as long or complicated as some other animes I've seen, but Asuna and Kazuto are the greatest anime couple there is. 
Sword Art Online is filled with great action and Science Fiction, but I like to view it as a love story. The reason Asuna and Kazuto make such a great couple is they're both fighting to beat the game so they can be together in real life; I just think that's such an original idea for character motivation and this whole anime is based around these characters love for each
                  other. Furthermore, you really get to see their love develop; they aren't star crossed lovers who spend all their screen time talking about how great it is to be in love, they actually cry, fight, pick themselves up, and because of this you really understand Kazuto better when he's fighting to protect Asuna. 
Also, Kazuto is without a doubt the hero of this story, but he understands he isn't immortal. In some stories heroes are glorified to the point where they seem invincible, but after Kazuto loses a battle he really feels his own limitations and when he's at his lowest he actually questions whether or not he'll be able to help anyone. 
This leads me into my next point which is how this anime understands the seriousness of death. ""If I die in the game, I die in real life"" is the slogan of this anime and that carries a lot of weight for the characters because for many characters in this anime the mere thought of dying causes them to lose their minds. The players trapped in this world aren't warriors IRL, they're regular people who now realize they have fight for their lives if they ever want to see the real word again, wouldn't you lose your mind if you were them?
Overall, Sword Art Online has a perfect balance of action and romance and I just love it!",10

                So, here is my opinion, at first: This is my first review, it's not going into all
parts like character writing, art etc.
So if you want a well researched and fair review, please move on, thank you.
At first:
I really liked this series! The idea of the story is so good, it overwhelmed me, the characters
are really good, you can really feel with them and understand them.
The technically idea about how this works is really good explained and well elaborated in my eyes.
You will be directly into the anime and you'll love the first 14 eps.
To understand the problems with the anime at some part, you should've
                  seen the summary / cover on the top here.
The bad:
This is a really good plot and in the first 14 episodes you'll love this anime for it, but after them
the scenery changes and takes place in another virtual world, where it's not a problem for the main
protagonist to die (respawn). This changes the whole feeling, if not changing the world is already self
explaining.
The story rushes from the beginning, I felt like that from the second episode, but I had no problem
with it, till this one hard cut in the middle came.
The story doesn't cut here, it's one big story still, but you'll feel like you where kicked out of a
dream.
It could even have ended with this 14th episode, it would've been a clean, even though not completely
explained ending.
The good:
I loved the love story, the fights, the friendships, the story about the problems in modern society
and the whole story so much, that I can oversee for myself this big kick in the face in the middle of the story.
The art is really well drawn, the sound quality is also good. ( Read: In my stream I didn't experienced
bad ones. )
Conclusion:
Not everyone will get into this, some will feel it too rushed so the death of a person isn't really interesting,
but if you love this idea and the world it can be really good.
My big warning is in the end the hard cut, and the nearly rape at the end.
The enjoyment was high enough in the end, and I think the ""watch at least 2 ep's"" rule also works here.
And I still think this is one of the shows that can be seen equally good as Clannad, ( I know some people will hate me for that. )",9
"
                I liked the first two episodes but then it just..Nope
Sword Art Online is the pinnacle of how shallow an anime can be.
 ""Super cool"" really powerful MC? Check. Overly annoying and unrealistic female love interest? Check. All of the female characters ride the MC's D? another check. Add an incest love drama in there as well and you have a show that makes every 12 year old or fat ""gamer"" believe he can get a super hot girlfriend like our dashing and charming MC Kirito has. 
However, If you told me you liked SAO solely for the music I wouldn't blame you.
it consistently has some
                  of the best music of any popular anime out there.",6
"
                STORY
A kid gets trapped in a video game where death is possible. Seems pretty unique so far right? But then suddenly, they made the main character broken compared to every other character aside from Heathcliffe. He then meets a girl named Asuna and they fall in love and decide to marry after a couple of episodes. Add in a couple of plot twists and you have its story.
ART
The artwork is beautiful. Fluid animation and amazing background art. Nothing much to say here.
SOUND
Wonderful opening and ending with an amazing OST soundtrack. Also semirealistic sound effects.
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
Main character already broken and in real life he is supposedly
                  anti-social, but suddenly in game he seems to have no trouble communicating with others. All the girls he meets magically fall in love with him. Not much to say here other than they didn't take the time to add in a realistic development.
ENJOYMENT
When you ignore the character development and story, it turns out to be pretty enjoyable. The fight scenes are intense and keep you on the edge of your seat.
OVERALL
Pretty well done, but needed to do better on the story and character development.",8

                Novel is written by Reki Kawaraha
Illustrated by: Abec
Directed by: Tomohiko Ito
Music by: Yuki Kajiura ( M fave~ )
The story is set on a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) named Sword Art Online. In this game the palyers are trapped and they can't get out unless they clear all the 100 floors. Now, this is new, for a gamer like me, this is really something I want to get involve to but.. there's a big BUT, in SAO, when you die you also die in real life...WOW.. and so Kirito's horror is just starting.
The story is by far great until Kirito cleared the
                  game and a new game replaced SAO and it's called ALO. I was frustrated at the second part.. It was a drag, I mean why is Kirito and Asuna separated,, It's awesome to see them together and just when you think they are going to meet when Yui ( their in-game 'daughter ) sensed that Asuna is trapped in the World Tree and Kirito flew to reach Asuna but never did. 
Not to mention this also Harem... which is okay for me since the protagonist chose one person not a polygamy unlike coughallcoughharemcoughanime.
The art.. well it's not great as the art in light novel or maybe Abec-san is just amazing.
The sound of course, it's Yuki Kajiura-san who made the music theme, I have nothing to say. The people who also sang the openings and endings of SAO did a great job as the song fits perfectly to the atmosphere of the anime.
Overall I enjoyed it!",9
"
                I, personally, enjoyed this show a lot. I loved the idea, which I had never heard of before. I heard about Log Horizon AFTER watching this, so I give the story a 10. Creative idea for the story. The art style is pretty average, not really worth mentioning. But I do like anime art styles in general, so I gave it a 7. The sound is okay, too. Nothing special. I feel that the character is where this show suffers the most, aside from one other thing i'll get to. Kirito is nearly flawless. This is, while very original, not good. A hero should have
                  a few bad things, but I applaud them for trying to be different. Character design is quite difficult. The only reason I gave it as high as a 3 is because everyone else is average, but his cousin (I forget her name) has a crush no him. That's original, at least from my experience. I enjoyed this show quite a bit, through all it's flaws. But I realize most would not. Overall, this gets a 6. I have an additional reason for this, that which does not fit into any other categories. The execution of the whole show was pitiful. They could have done EVERYTHING so much better. I can't describe it. All in all, I wish this show lived up to all the incredible potential it had. Too bad SAO II didn't build on that potential.",6
"
                I feel compelled to write a review for this hot steamer. Perhaps this is because of the hype train this thing SOMEHOW managed to conjure up. This is really just so I can get this off my chest, but I will be breaking this thing down by each category.  For your sake, stop now. What lies ahead is not a pretty sight. 
All you need to know is this: 
Overall: (2/10)
Are you still here? You're a brave soul... I hope you're ready for this.
Let's get the ""good"" stuff out of the way first.Art: (6/10)
The artwork is at its best during the battle scenes. It's not bad. It's not fantastic. You look at it and you think ""Oh! those are pretty colors,"" then you forget about it. It doesn't do anything to enhance the atmosphere. It's there simply for you to gawk at.
Sound: (6/10)
Just like with the animation, the sound direction is fairly average. It's not bad. It's not fantastic. It's just there when it needs to be. There isn't anything particularly memorable about it. There was never a moment where I thought ""Wow this music is really powerful!"" It serves its purpose.
Okay, well that just about sums up the ""positives."" Now we can move on to the fun stuff.
Story: (2/10)
The first two episodes of this show are actually good. It does a good job of setting up the whole ""you're stuck in a video game"" idea, and the boss fight is exciting. It's after this point where the entire show falls apart. Basically, the writers told us we were getting cake, but little did we know the filling was made from regurgitated feces. You take that first bite and you think ""Oooh that's some yummy frosting!"" But by the time you get into the meat of it, it's too late. The plot from here on can be summed up as a harem anime. You thought you were getting a cool action show. Instead you get incoherent time skips, filler episodes, forced cheesy romance, fan-service, and a tentacle monster.
Characters: (1/10)
You thought the plot sounds bad? The characters are detestably cliche. The main protagonist, Kirito, is unstoppable. He's the best at everything. He never loses. He has zero depth, and due to all the time skipping the viewer is not allowed to grow with the character at all. One episode ends in one place, and in the next you have no idea what is going on. You feel like you've missed dozens of episodes worth of character development. It's infuriating.
Asuna isn't any better really. She exists solely for the purpose of serving Kirito and contributes nothing beyond that. All of the side characters and villains aren't even worth remembering because they are completely insignificant.
Enjoyment: (2/10)
At this point, I don't really need to explain how much I ""enjoyed"" this do I? Maybe if you haven't had any time to develop your taste, you may like this show for the setting and animation. But that's a huge stretch. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The most surprising thing to me is how popular this show is. It's immense... I just don't get it. My friends love it... and I feel like a jerk when I tell them how awful it is. Am I a bad person for thinking it deserves only contempt? For me, the absolute worst part about it is how the anime community makes me feel like I am in the wrong, when I know just how loathsome it is. It just makes me feel totally crazy.",2
"
                Great anime! I started watching SAO half a year ago but then stopped, because it felt kinda incoherent and rushed. Then some days ago I gave SAO a second chance (watched it within 3 days lol) and that was reallly worth it! Btw I didn't read the light novel.
I thought I wourld get an action anime with a little bit of romance as sidekick, but the romance part is a really important part of the story. I personally liked that a lot.
The art and soundtrack were outstanding (esp the opening and ending) and it does a good job at giving you an impression how it
                  could feel to live in such a game.
The pacing of the story was also not to fast (after the first few episodes), but also not too slow.
So all in all I enjoyed Sword Art Only really much and I can wholeheartedly recommend it.",10

                First things first...
I really don't like this anime... Well, I don't hate this, but I don't like it.
I just don't know. Maybe the factor that it became overrated or mainstream in any other anime/social sites.

                **THIS REVIEW IS 100% BIASED** (and there are spoilers so be warned)
Well, now that i've gotten that out of the way, here is MY PERSONAL review of the anime Sword Art Online. It probably is unfitting of what most people say (I've heard every negative thing said about SAO). However, there is a reason why Sword Art Online is my favorite anime to this day. I'll start with my **personal** reasons on why I gave it a score of 10. 
To put it simply: The rating of 10 comes from personal enjoyment. Was this anime perfect? No. Was this anime flawed in a lot of
                  ways? Yes. Do I care? NOPE! At the time I decided to watch SAO, I had previously been unexposed to the action genre. Being a young *ish* (16 yr old at the time) female I typically enjoyed romance and shoujo anime. So SAO was something quite new and exciting for me to pick up. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, so of course at first I did not notice the flaws in storyline and progression that everyone seems to point out (at first anyway). To me, I simply adored the mix of action and romance, considering I still loved watching romance in anime. I will go into more details about this when I discuss characters, but my point is that the combination of action (something new) mixed with romance (something I loved) in a cool stuck-in-a-game setting was REALLY EXCITING to me. I soon fell in love with *almost* all the characters (talking about you, Silica...) and became a huge fan of the series from then on. I have re-watched the whole anime (both seasons) 4 times, so as that shows, I definitely know my way around the series. 
Now with that aside, I will rate some aspects of the anime like music, characters, story (with some bias obviously, as I stated above)!
~Animation~
This one is a 10/10 stars for me. SAO had (and has) a pretty large production budget. When you compare it to anime like Log Horizon, you can tell the difference (not to bash on Log Horizon). Many talented animators were brought in to work on this anime, and it is especially apparent with its brilliant action scenes, lively colors, and beautiful landscapes and scenery. I could go on and on, but I believe I have made my point. 
~Soundtrack~
Again, a 10/10 for me. The main battle theme Swordland is very memorable, and to this day gives me chills. It is no surprise that SAO has excellent music, as very talented Yuki Kajiura provided works for OST. Most people probably know she's done music for other well received anime such as Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero and so on. Every theme is fitting and I still listen to the OST to this day. All the openings and endings are catchy and I personally enjoy them. Overall, a stunning soundtrack for a stunning anime!
~Characters~
Oooh boy, one of the places where SAO gets bashed a ton. ""Here we have the main protagonist: completely lifeless, pointlessly overpowered, boring personality. Then we have the badass female lead who turns into a cookie-cutter tsundre"". I'm here to explain why I believe that those characters are more than what people negatively say about them. Personally, the characters section gets a solid 7/10. While there are some good characters, there are definitely places where this anime fails to deliver in its characters. To explain, let's start with the good: none other than Kirito (let me remind anyone reading again that this is my personal opinion)~
Kirito is my favorite character in the series. At the start, his personality comes across as a cold, introvert. He has trouble making everyday small talk, and this is portrayed very well. As he is a loner, he enjoys playing solo and does not like forming parties (he has trouble finding a partner for the first boss raid). However, we can see that as the course of the anime goes on, certain things happen to him to shape his personality. He goes through heartbreak, does things he regrets, and finds it within himself to beat the death game for a very compelling and heartwarming reason. In my opinion, Kirito is the most interesting character in the whole series. I do not find him boring, and despite all things, I actually find him *somewhat* relatable. People criticize saying it is hard to empathize with someone who is too perfect, but I disagree. During all his hardships, I truly felt his pain, I could feel real emotion from him as he fought battles and escaped near-death situations. 
So maybe he is a tad overpowered for his own good (hacking the game console, really?) However, is that REALLY bad? I don't find it to be. Sure, it might have been cool to see some progression from when he started off as being a ""noob"", but hey, he was a former beta tester after all, and seems to have a decent knowledge of games in general. That alone can explain why Kirito is a much better player than the majority of the 10,000 who are trapped. There are (unfortunately) some major time skips that happen which fail to show any progression from his character (more on this in the story section), and after a two year time skip, he is leaps and bounds better. Unfortunately, we do not get to see this development. It just happens. However, I don't feel like this limits his character. You can still see his character develop in other ways as he finds his romantic interest, and begins to see a future that involves her. His personality is shaped by the interactions he has with the people around him, and the experiences he goes through. From his guilt of killing the moonlit black cats, to facing Akihiko Kayaba at the end, to nearly dying by a laughing coffin member, and so on. You will start to see how his mindset goes initially from it being all about himself and how he was going to survive... to turning the focus on saving Asuna. A shift from selfish to selfless. This continues to show through in the second half of the first season all the way to the second. He is always determined to keep his party members alive. I loved his determination, how he never gave up. His sheer passion for what he was doing was incredible to watch. I could really see how much he loved Asuna, and how much he was willing to do to clear the game.
Another negative aspect that people say about Kirito is that he gets a special skill: Dual Blades. How could this be? Why is he the only one? Well, Kayaba (the creator of SAO) stated very clearly that this skill was awarded to the player with the fastest reflexes, or someone that he thought would be the one to beat the game. That may not reflect how games are played in real life, and to that I say SAO is NOT a typical game! This is a fantasy game, in a fantasy world, and of course, it does not need to reflect how things are done in our real world, period. 
Before this gets too long, I want to state that I do see where his character has flaws, but to me, the good outweighs the bad. It didn't stop me from absolutely loving him as a character. I know not many will agree with me on this, but this is what I truly believe. 
Asuna is another great character (my second favorite). We can see some fantastic character development in the first season as she goes from seriousness, to learning how to love the dire situation she was in. Although she was trapped in the world of SAO, she didn't hide herself in the town of beginnings, but rather ventured out to clear the game. Even though she had never played a game in her life, she decided that living in fear wasn't going to be an option. In my opinion, that takes courage. In the Mothers Rosario arc, we also see lots more much needed back story of her home life, and we can see how the effects of Sword Art Online make things troubling at home. 
Overall, I can see how people say that Asuna is a ""cookie cutter character"", however, I think she has more complexity than that. For critics, she is too ""tsundre"", but again, is that a bad thing? (Toradora's Taiga... hello?) It may be typical and not unique however, I think Asuna goes beyond her ""lackluster tsundre trope"". For one, she is essential to the story, not only as Kirito's love, but for the sole fact that Kirito and Asuna are a great team. We can see how her experiences in the death game evolve her personality into becoming someone who would risk her own life to save the one she loves. I personally enjoyed her spunk and and feminine, yet badass personality.
I loved seeing such a strong female lead in this anime. At times, she may be slightly shadowed by her counterpart Kirito, but that does not make her any less of a character (more so in the second part of the first season). She and Kirito make a fantastic couple. I was delighted while watching the romance between them ensue. They might have been young, but it was pleasant, and heart-warming to see.
Finally, I have a very quick note on Yui. Personally, I found her as an addition to the family to be extremely cute, which further bonded Kirito and Asuna's relationship. Yui could be seen as a cheat device, but I think the complexity of Yui being an artificial intelligence, yet seemingly having real life emotions adds to the futuristic setting we are in (2024). Yui was created to assist players with mental health problems, but she was attracted attracted to Kirito and Asuna because they were among the few players who still managed to laugh and be happy despite dire situation they were in. She managed to defy the game master and help Kirito and Asuna, something that goes beyond what a normal AI should be able to do. I found that connection between them to be adorable especially the fact that she was their adoptive daughter! 
Now, to try to wrap things up, I'm going to quickly say a few things about the rest of the characters in general. Unfortunately, I believe that some characters were useless in SAO. Silica and Liz are the two that stand out in this category. To me, they did not add much to the story of value, and seemed to be more filler than anything. Other characters like Klien and Agil were great, however, I wish they had more screen time. 
Sinon and Yuuki were well fleshed out characters as well, however, this review will become way too long if I start talking about that. Suguha, or Leafa is another character that had complexity, however, I personally was not a fan of her incest love for her brother. Some of the villains are too stereotypically villain-y (at least that is what most people tend to say), but it did the job (and made me hate them). Overall, there were some issues with characters, but for the sole reason that the two main characters were great, I still can find enjoyment with the rest. 
~Story~
This one gets a 10/10 for me. It has a fantastic plot. I mean, come on, trapped in a VIRTUAL REALITY video game? That with the added ""if you die in the game, you die in real life"" factor makes this incredibly fascinating to watch. It was a concept that I had never thought of before. That is one of the reasons why I loved it so much the first time I watched it. 
Moving on to the second half, the whole story of saving Asuna is loathed by many, but I found that half to be very moving and driven, as you can see Kirito's determination very apparently in this arc as well (especially when he makes attempts to get to the top of the world tree). I did not mind that Asuna was a ""damsel in distress"" in this case. I loved seeing Kirito's love for Asuna continue to shine through his actions. The downside? It took the compelling death game aspect away, which lowered the stakes in a way. It wasn't a huge problem for me though.
The Gun Gale Online arc attempted to bring back the death game aspect with death gun (who looks and sounds way too much like darth vader by the way) It was enjoyable, but there was a lack of Asuna which wasn't my favorite, especially since Sinon was a LITTLE too comfortable with Kirito in that cave....
The 3 episode arc in between GGO and Mother's Rosario is nothing special. Basically a side quest for a sword. That's it.
The Mother's Rosario arc featured Asuna and some new characters. Easily the second most emotional arc there is in SAO. I really loved the focus on Asuna, and how much emotion and character development there was. (Sorry about the shallow reviews and summaries here, but I've been at this for two hours and I'm starting to feel like this review is too long!!) 
~Plot Execution~
The worst part of SAO in my opinion (however, this does NOT influence how I feel overall about it). I give it a 6/10. Like I mentioned earlier, there are too many time skips, too many pointless, filler episodes, and I sometimes wish that the anime could be redone but using the progressive novels instead of the original light novels. I also wish there was more focus on the Aincrad arc. Stopping mid season felt so unfinished (although, it was an interesting plot twist. I definitely was not expecting that), as even critics agree that the Aincrad arc was easily the best part of SAO. So with those critical flaws, the ideas and story were great, just poorly executed in my opinion if I will be honest. However, this does not change how I feel about SAO as a whole. As I stated above, my 10 score is based on my enjoyment I have had for the anime, so the negative aspects don't bother me! 
I'm going to go ahead and end the review here. I could easily continue writing this and polish my thoughts even more. However, that is for another time. Kudos to you if you read this far. I bet you're a hardcore SAO fan like me, haha (or heck you might be a hater trying to comprehend how I could even think the way I do). Anyhow, I hope this shows you why I personally loved Sword Art Online so much. Even though I know lots hate it, there are also those like me who love it. Here's hoping this essay explained that thoroughly. Until next time!",10
"
                It's really is pathetic. We've seen it all before, in anime like .hack//SIGN. It's like every anime where there is gamers involved, they never come up with any original material, it's all the same type of plot line, 'gamer logs into game, can't log out, if gamer dies in game, gamer dies in real life'. Please.... >:( That's why I didn't like it, I didn't feel like I was getting anything new with this. To me, it felt like the storyline has been taken straight out of .hack//SIGN, but a bunch of different characters thrown in. Absolutely LAME. If you haven't seen this, or the
                  other anime I mentioned, then it might be somewhat interesting to you. If you have seen both, then you probably get where I'm coming from here, and can see the similarities between both anime.",2
"
                SAO will always split the anime community. A good portion thinks the show is the best thing since sliced bread and another (equally large portion) that think it is the worst thing ever. Neither IMHO is right. There are worse shows but there are definitely better ones too. I admit that I enjoyed the first half of the first season quite a lot. It was one of the first shows that used the concept of a player ending up in a gaming world and due to the fact that there were actual stakes since people really died for real when they died in the world,
                  made it even more dramatic. I loved Asuna for being a BAMF who was an equal and even more than an equal to Kirito but then the second half fo season one and the Alfheim storyline happened and everything became a mess. As a complete insult, Asuna was turned into the damsel of distress that she never was during the first half of the season and the story itself was a tired re-hash of the original SAO storyline only with less dramatic fighting but cute little fairies and flying. And then season two happened and the less is said about that particular mess the better. SAO became a full-fledged harem show that threw out any coherent storyline and instead of swords, there were now guns. SAO should have ended after its 12th episode and everybody would have remembered it as the amazing show it used to be.  Watch SAO but stick to the first story arc and forget about everything else. The first storyline would get a solid 8 or 9 from me but due to the rest of the first season and the second season, the show isn't worth more than a 4.",4

                *^* MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD *^*
I loved the first episode of SAO. The premise was great, a gorgeous virtual world introduced and then turned into a prison. I thought Kayaba Akihiko's introduction was brilliant, revealing the hidden dark layer of the game visually. You won't see blood, the enemy doesn't even 'really exist', it looks like a video game but the consequences are real. Although I found the MC kinda cold and maybe too accepting of his fate, I was excited to see more.
Then came the 2nd episode and although it felt somewhat rushed I enjoyed everything from the boss fight to the introduction of parties,
                  floor bosses and Asuna. Kirito was confusing, as he sometimes looked smart and mature but he was also annoying with his edgy lonewolf attitude.
And now I was expecting them to work towards floor 2. Nope says Episode 3, have a timeskip. And by the way here is another rushed story. This time of some saint friends forming a guild, bonding with Kirito and dying in rapid succession. Bad storytelling, and now Kirito is even more of an edgy lonewolf so that's character development I guess. 
Unfortunately those 3 episodes are the best of this series by far. What follows is lots of 'filler' episodes that barely contribute to the main story while the main story advances somewhere out of sight. Each episode has lots of timeskips and when we return to the main story Mr. plot armor destroys stuff until we can go back to more fillers and more Mr. Awesomepants! The show loses its dark nature completely during the fillers and becomes a light-hearted adventure that worships Kirito. All the side characters are bland and have no depth. Except Asuna, who is developed from a fierce tsundere fighter to an obedient housewife. To make things better almost all the side characters are cute girls that fall in love with Kirito in 20 minutes!
I don't even wanna spend time talking about the 2nd part of the show. Kirito-kun saves the princess by being OP and a few more girls fall in love with him. Also fanservice. Okay. To sum up, I think story-wise and character-wise, SAO was a letdown. 
SAO did have good production value though. The action scenes were okay in the first half and great in the second. I really enjoyed some of the duels in the 2nd half. The audiovisuals were quite good overall, the world looked stunning and the soundtrack accompanied each scene well.
But overall I can't recommend this to anyone. Its greatest feats are its production value and battles, and there are shows that do both of those much better than SAO. Just watch something else.",3

                WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
This review may contain spoilers! I don't review much and its mostly me just ranting if I do. If you are ok with the things i just said then please continue reading my review.
So I just got done watching SAO for a second time (marathon mode) and it was just as good as the first time if not better. For the life of me I honestly can't see all the hate for this show. I sat there and tried to pick out things that made no sense/were just plain stupid and it was REALLY hard! The only, I repeat ONLY
                  thing that didn't make sense was how both Kirito and Asuna died but still survived. Then again Kayaba could have just overridden the death thing because ""they"" beat him.
Now, onto my rant!
People have many different opinions about this show. Its love or hate. People  say it sucked all the way through, after episode 3, or after SAO. I can see why people say it sucks after episode 3 because of the pacing but honestly, I had no issue with it. I would not be able to stand watching dungeon for dungeon, boss for boss (this is 75 levels we're talking about here). 
Pacing aside, lets talk about Asuna and Kirito (""the story""). Oh no, now I've gone and done it! I ask anyone who reads this exactly how they are a forced and plot driven couple? EVERY COUPLE IN ANY SERIES IS PLOT DRIVEN AND FORCED! Sorry, had to do that. Anyway, my point is this, they knew each other for 2 years before they hooked up. Before that they pretty much hated/couldn't get along/never saw eye to eye. In the game the thing that matters the most is staying alive, after that its all about power. Kirito and Asuna trusted each other with their lives and would fight side by side. They both respected each other for how strong they were and by default associated with one another because they were on the assault team. Asuna was a tight wad, Kirito is a slacker in every sense (opposites attract) and by simply telling Asuna to chill out and enjoy life in the game for what it was Kirito did her a favor. That is what starts it and from there they continue spending more time together. Seriously, SAO is a life or death game, the fact that he actually stuck around watch over while she slept IS a big thing imo (people can kill you in your sleep). People under extreme conditions do crazy things that don't make sense to average everyday people (like fall in love with someone because they protected you). As for the rest of them, I'll cover that once I get to ALO.
The art is another thing I've heard people talk about but I have serious difficulty trying to figure that out. As of late a lot of series/movie have tried to blend 3D CGI and 2D animation together and have been failing horribly. Its sickening to see how badly 3D sticks out on a 2D backdrop. SAO managed to pull it off and have it blend very well. Sure, with the dragon and that skeleton thing it stuck out a bit but not to the point that it rustled my jimmies. As for colors, shadows, characters, and just general design I don't have one complaint. Kirito's jacket is bad ass and I want one, that is all to be said.
Now for the really fun part, ALO! Oh no, I'm doing it again! Time to rustle some jimmies for sure! Let me put it straight to you, I enjoyed it, a lot at that! Sure, it was quick, very quick, but it was a blast! Who doesn't want wings!? How can you not want to fly? That alone made it super cool! Ok, that and because Kirito came in like a boss and saved Leefa with some super speed with ultra uber stats that rocked the bad guys socks off. The magic was pretty cool and well thought out (you can't just spam fire spells and healing all day). As for Leefa and Kirito, I know, its a touchy topic. I'll say this much, if you can just look over the fact that its incest kinda sorta but not really since it never really happens then its all good! I will admit that most if not all of the sexual thing in this arc are for for fan service (I loved it) but hey, you gotta reward the fans some how. Also, about Asuna locked up in a cage wait for Kirito was kinda cool. It really changed the dynamic of the show since Leefa is pretty much useless in any fight (again, she IS there for fan service). In a way this arc kinda helps to teach Kirito that stats and skills don't mean everything and that you really do need friends/a guild to fight really strong opponents. Soloing just doesn't work in ALO so its kinda cool! One last thing, Yui comes back and is kawii as ever, nuf said.
I guess I have to add in something about the music as well. I loved both of opening and endings. I also liked all the battle music plus the sitting around and talking music since it reminds me of visual novel music which I really enjoy as well. I don't really know how to talk about the music so lets just say its somewhere between liked it a lot and loved it.
I don't think this really counts a ""true review"" since its mostly me ranting and not dissecting the show but I think I've hit on the main subjects. All in all this show has just moved up on my list from a 9/10 to a 10/10. I really enjoyed it a second time around.
Plus, who doesn't wanna dance on the clouds?",10

                Before I begin my review, I'm one of those people who really like this anime. If you're one of those haters, then don't read my review. I'm gonna be very positive in this review.
Here I go.......
First of all, let's talk about the songs. The songs are pretty catchy. I have downloaded their songs in my phone to listen. The story is very unique and awesome. It is very well told and very understandable. The action is badass, well one of the best sword fights in anime, IMO. The characters are well developed and given enough screentime. The romance is quite not good more like awkward.
The
                  first part was legendary while second part is OK for me. It has the best intro of the anime. Then the second part is pretty good too. Season 2, first part has brought another legendary opening. Then the second part left me a little disappointed. But the movie Ordinal Scale, saved this anime.
I have seen Season 2 and Ordinal Scale. In terms of my favorite arc, Ordinal Scale is the best. It gave me goosebumps at the end. Season 3 I can't wait.",9
"
                **Note that review will contain minor spoilers, including the ending of the first major arc and how it sets up the second major arc of the series.**
Why did it happen? It shouldn't have happened? But it did happen.
First, I'm going to come out with it: I HATE SAO. Whew, I'm glad I got that off my chest. Ok, so even though I obviously have some strong feelings about my stance, I'm going to do my best about being as fair and critically accurate in my review as possible. 
Now, this show has an amazing premise. New video game technology that lets users explore a new
                  world as if it were real life. So right away, we have video games. That should be enough to bring a big fan base for the show. Next, the players are trapped in the game and are forced to beat the game's 100 floors in order to return to the real world. And death in the game means death in real life. The setting is both simple and brilliant, and it allows a viewer to become encapsulated right from the get go. So with such a start, the show couldn't possibly go wrong, right? Unfortunately, the show does go wrong. There are mistakes made periodically that turn the show for the worse. And the first mistake is *drum roll* the main character, Kirito!
Kirito is perhaps the biggest problem with SAO. I don't want to call him a wish fulfillment character...but that's kind of what he is. Kirito beats the bad guys because he's Kirito. Kirito solves the hard problems because he's Kirito. Kirito gets all the ladies because he's Kirito. And by getting all the ladies, I mean that he's a complete womanizer. There are at least three female characters that show up for one episode, simply to fall in love with Kirito and then be dumped...or die. You would think that Kirito being a loser in real life would translate to being a loser in SAO life, but it's quite the opposite. There are (many) other problems with characters in the show, but I can get back to that later.
The pacing of the show is terrible, and the direction the show went in was atrocious. Remember the whole deal about the conflict being that they were trapped in the video game and needed to beat it to escape to the real world? Well, that changes half way through the series. I won't get too in depth, but basically, Kirito uses his Kirito powers to beat the game without making it to floor 100. And the way he does it is...well, just remember that Kirito is a wish fulfillment character, and he can do anything. Also, the episodes of the show that lead up to that climax are paced terribly, even as much as being months apart (in terms of the timeline in the show). And a lot of those episodes have tons of filler. Our characters would sometimes rather fish and cook and pick flowers instead of fighting for their lives.
Now stop right there!
If the show followed the linear path of Kirito and the gang fighting to floor 100 and beating the final boss, thus saving the thousands of people stuck in the game, that would be perfectly fine with me. Seriously. And I'd rather that whole plot consists of almost twice the episode count of the series as a whole. But instead of getting a well-developed plot, we get two under developed plots. The first plot being SAO, and the second being...Alfheim!!!   
Yeah, a new video game called Alfheim is the setting for the latter half of the show. You would think that after the SAO incident, people wouldn't be stupid and stop buying those real world video games. And (almost) nobody is trapped in Alfheim. I lost all engagement in the show almost as soon as I finished the first arc. Note that I still enjoyed the first arc because of my initial liking of the show's premise. What was at stake in the first arc was thousands of lives. What was at stake in the second arc was Kirito's girlfriend, Asuna.
Asuna is the girl our pimped out main character eventually settles on. As a character, she is certainly flawed. She starts off being very mysterious, while also being a total boss in combat. As the plot began to progress some, she became more of a Cinderella in a sense. Still, I had quite a liking for her. For all intents and purposes, Kirito wakes up from his video game sleep while Asuna does not. Somehow, this insanely creepy new antagonist manages to keep her locked up in Alfheim with the intent to brainwash her so that she loves him in real life. And also to enslave humanity with the same technology...somehow. It seemed like Kirito only cared about Asuna anyway. Asuna becomes the proverbial Princess Peach, and all she does is either wait for Kirito to save her, fail at trying to save herself, or get virtually molested by our new bad guy.
Part of what was so engaging about the first arc was how the players adapted to their new life in SAO. It was said early on how at first every day spent in SAO was a day lost in real life. But then, SAO kind of became life. It was the new world where the players lived. Also, when people had to fight monsters and beat dungeons, their lives were on the line, as well as thousands of others. So naturally, if that were the case, why wouldn't the characters act so serious? Well, when the only thing at stake was Kirito's girlfriend, he should have been the only one to take the game Alfheim so super seriously. If all of the players hadn't grown wings and pointy ears, you would still have thought they were all in SAO, fighting for their lives. You would think the people playing Alfheim would treat it like a video game, because, well, it is a video game. But no, they treat it like their lives are actually on the line (or girlfriends in this case). Without the intense life or death conflict of the first half of the show, it's hard to be engaged in the second half.   
My final score is a 3/10 instead of a 1/10 for two reasons.
1. Although I finished of the show bored and disappointed, I really found a way to be engaged by the first arc, despite its flaws. Sometimes you can find it in your heart to really enjoy something, even though you know it's not that wonderful.
2. If there is one saving grace to SAO, it is the animation, action sequences, and to a lesser extent the sound. Many bright colors and creative textures help liven up scenes of fast paced and intense fighting. Still, Kirito being as overpowered as he is ruined many of these sequences for me.",3
"
                Although the anime is still being produced (Episode 17 just came out on Oct. 27th) this anime so far has been thrilling, amazing, heart wrenching and a very good action, romance anime. 
The story in a nutshell is put together really well and is unique but similar to .//Hack where the main character is trapped in a game. The differences that make this anime stand out though is the art! The scenes are beautiful and fantasy based. The characters are drawn really well and ultimately it is appealing to the eyes.
Sound, the music picked for all the scenes are well placed. Battle/action noises are perfect
                  and there is not a over abundence of grunts, screams, etc. that tend to get annoying really fast. 
Characters, the character I could go over for DAYS, Drawn well, like I said, I am very picky when it comes to animes being appealing and this one is just that! SAO puts so much character building into the romance parts along with several of the friendships and it is very welcomed overall. The plot is not rushed in the slightest which I love and although there are time skips it is not problematic to follow the characters WHAT SO EVER. 
Just overall I have loved this anime enough to write and review about it even though it is only half way over. It is a step above the rest and includes many good genres. If I could hug the people who made SAO I would, and tell them to never let it end.",10
"
                So... For me personally this is the first Anime series I've ever watched. I used to be against anything anime and took the high road when it came to watching it. That was until I stumbled across SAO. I binge watched through the Aincrad and Farie arc's in 2 days and I can quite happily say. I loved it. With this being my first anime I know my opinion won't sway much but for what it's worth, why not?
Art: 8 (Super beautiful scenery)
Sound: 9 (Didn't have much to compare it too on my behalf but from an aspiring sound designers PoV the sounds where solid
                  and consistent throughout)
Characters: 8 (Really liked all of the characters. I'm not soft to emotional punches in movies etc, but the relationship between Kirito and Asuna really plucked at those mighty heart strings in parts, truly goals :D )
Enjoyment: 9 (Like I said it's my first anime but I loved the first 2 arc's and I've just started SAO II so I can't wait for that)
Overall: 9 (For my first anime, I don't think in my mind I could've started anywhere else. Perfect for a newbie anime watcher!)",9
"
                This anime...I just...I can't even. I got to the beginning of episode 11 I think and just stopped. I was trying it out for a friend who really seemed to like it but no matter how much I tried, I couldn't get into the anime. The plot line was so unoriginal, the time skips frustrated me to no end, there were one-sided romances where girls would fall for Kirito yet we already knew they weren't gonna work out and it was pretty much useless to the story line, and well...there was just something about it that didn't attract me. I liked the action in it
                  and I was a little curious to see if the players would ever manage to get out of the game, but the cons outweighed my pros and I just left the series. I liked Kirito's character to an extent. He showed plenty of leadership skills and he was a pretty bad-butt player. I can list several other series with similar plots to this one: ""The Matrix"", ""No Game No Life"", ""Log Horizon"", and ""Btooom!""",4
"
                Sword Art Online was kind of all over the place, sometimes I was like WOW and didn't exactly get bored, but wasn't really having fun either... it was hard to summarize how I felt exactly. 
Mostly, it wasn't that fun though. 
SAO is basically the story of Kirito and a few friends that get trapped in an online MMO game. Now, at this point I vaguely recalled the likes of .hack and other MMO anime which, as far as I know, people really liked and were quite entertained. 
However, SAO is not intended to be that kind of happy experience, instead Asuna was like I
                  said kind of cool but then she doesn't really have a major impact, it's pretty much all Kirito, who can be pretty boring in some ways. 
I guess at the same time though it was kind of fun at times, for whatever reason the main friend of Kirito Klein throughout the whole thing was pretty amusing, he kept getting all upset and annoyed at Kirito and Asuna for being so reckless and crazy and I was like yeah no kidding!! He was really not a main character though which was one of the issues, I guess it just seemed like Asuna and Kirito were both just so into each other and then there's Klein like HEY GUYS THIS IS CRAZY. I guess he was like the voice of reason basically. 
But that was just a tiny bit in what was really just a VN of maybe a not so good video game. Call me picky (or the gamer in me or whatever) but SAO seems like one really boring MMO, really you level up and pick that many skills from a list, you fight boars outside a main quest town? Tolkien called, he once his thing back. 
Ultimately I think a 6 is pretty good which is like somewhere in the middle, because really this was just not fun at times, but kind of fun at other times.",6
"
                Sword Art Online holds a special place in my heart because this is the anime that brought me to watch more animations so my review may be biased. 
The anime started strong which caught my attention with the characters being stuck in a game world where death is permanent, both in the game and in reality and being unable to logout. As I continued watching, I grew fond with the relationship between the main characters and how the players adapted to the lifestyle of Aincrad. 
As a big fan of MMORPGs myself, I also find it very interesting to watch how it would be to
                  live a life or start a family inside an MMORPG.
For me, Sword Art Online is truly a really awesome anime with a very interesting plot which slowed down after the first arc but still caught enough attention for me to keep watching. I would recommend this anime to everyone but again, my opinion is biased. ^^",10
"
                Before I begin, I'd like to say that there has also been a lot of unnecessary hatred towards this anime and it's fan-base probably because of it's overwhelming popularity during 2012. Many haters consider this anime as a complete failure, but I believe this is a decent anime. 
Sword Art Online (SAO) was a rather enjoyable experience from start to finish, and the anime adaptation was, in many aspects, better than the manga. SAO does a great job of addressing concepts that cannot be addressed in other anime such as love in virtual reality (is it truly genuine?) and morality in virtual reality (should people
                  do immoral things because it's not the real world?)
The series at first seems like a shounen, big fights and overpowered characters; but after a few episodes, SAO quickly shifts to a romance anime. At times, SAO can be excessively dramatic, which kills the moment. However, the story itself is good for the most part, but the first season ends awkwardly and the second season pales in comparison to the first. A lot of people complain that the love between Kazuto and Asuna ruin the series, but I think it was touching to see how far one would go to save the one they loved.
Character development in SAO is very limited and the only characters that are really of importance are Kazuto (Kirito) Kirigaya and Asuna Yuuki. Other characters make short appearances and are usually only there as filler characters. In the second season, Suguha Kirigaya (Kazuto's sister/cousin), becomes another important character.
The sound was fair; the background music went well for most of the peaceful moments but when it came down to the fights, the BGM lacks. Since I think sound includes voice-acting, I'll also say that the voice actors did an impressive job. The opening and ending themes were enjoyable and I really enjoyed the opening by LiSA ""crossing fields"".
Sword Art Online's art is very well done. The world of Aincard (the virtual world in Sword Art Online) is well detailed and very colorful. The world of Alfheim in the second season lacks the impressive overworld detail that Aincard had in the first season. 
Overall, I give Sword Art Online an 8/10. I enjoyed watching it and it is the first anime from this decade (2010-Present) to truly catch my attention. Many will say that Sword Art Online is a bust, but I believe this anime breaks away from the current trend of anime with excessive etchi/fanservice  and violence. I won't consider SAO a masterpiece, but I will consider it as one in my long line of favorites.",8
"
                This anime has gotten a lot of strong opinions from a lot of different people and despite having aired over five years ago it’s still one of the most talked about anime. Some say the widespread hate for it is just because of all the negative reviews of it on the internet and others say it’s so bad that having it in your favourites is proof that you have bad taste, but although it’s one of the most common gateway anime that doesn’t mean liking it makes you unknowledgeable about anime automatically.
The story is definitely not generic in any way, but it also wasn’t the
                  first of its time like some people think. Tron was the first type of any media to have the concept of getting stuck in a videogame and .hack was the first anime to do this. This can be credited as being the anime that made the genre popular or even the one that turned it into a genre at all, so that is something it can be credited with. Although it terms of concept the story was good the execution leaves much to be desired. The main character is already at the top of his game, which many know to be the boring part of their game. Just like how most romances are about two characters falling in love rather than just showing their daily lives being in love the same is for any story. The story you would expect in a fantasy anime where the protagonist gets better over time doesn’t happen since he’s already so much better than anyone else that he doesn’t need to get better and is basically just showing off for most of the anime. The story of clearing the floors to get to the top one to beat the game seems like a good enough idea, but clearly showing all of the unique rooms and the characters who beat each one would be boring and tedious, but it felt a bit forced the way they dealt with making this process faster.
The Princess Asuna arc was a lot worse than the Aincrad arc. I guess this is a bit of a spoiler to mention even the existence of this arc, but I would guess you’ve probably already seen the show anyway. Asuna was a well developed character in the first arc and unlike most of the female characters showed some actual character development that wasn’t cringy, but in this arc she became a princess who needed rescuing, which is really a waste of a good character. It’s only 11 episodes which is shorter than the first arc, but I feel like the show would be better as a whole if the second arc didn’t exist. The average quality was dragged down a lot by this.
The art in this anime is fairly decent. The character designs are fairly generic and we have a regular spiky black haired protagonist, but the rest of the art is done well. The layout of the world is done well and the backgrounds are well drawn. It’s a fairly small world they live on, but they do show a lot of good things around it even though they often don’t give enough context to show exactly where everything is in relation to each other, especially since a lot of their world is vertical which makes accurate maps hard to draw. The weapons and outfits look cool, just as they’re supposed to, but the whole concept of an MMORPG that has warrior as the only class is kind of flawed and there could be a lot more cool weapons and outfits if it was set up like a proper RPG. The fight scenes were animated well and the icons and screens in the game were made well. They did a lot to show us that they really were in a videogame as opposed to some anime where they go to the world but when they get there it isn’t a videogame anymore.
The theme songs were good and the background music was great. Swordland has a real feeling of epicness and even though I don’t consider the anime as a whole to be all that great that song still gives me nostalgia. I watched the series in dub so I can’t comment on the original voice acting, but the dub was done fairly well. The sound effects are pretty good, but they do mess up sometimes and they don’t always enhance the scene but occasionally make it worse.
The characters, just like in any anime, are probably the most important part to talk about. Kirito, the main character, has far too much power, as I’ve already mentioned. He doesn’t have much of a personality other than being overpowered and being arrogant about it, despite originally trying to cover it up. He’s able to escape a situation where the game would have expected any normal person to have died where the nervegear doesn’t manage to kill him, but according to my calculations the nervegear would take around two hours to kill an adult by frying the brain like an extremely low current microwave so his recovery just means he has a stronger will to live than the others. To be honest, it’s less odd that he survived that and more odd that no one else did. Even if it uses electric shock to make the victim unconscious to give the microwaves enough time to kill them you’d think other people would have been immune rather than the protagonist being the only person to overcome it while thousands of others died from it and not a single one of them did what he did.
Aside from Asuna pretty much all of the girls have very little personality. We basically just have them introduced as “harem girl #X” and have a few pieces of basic information to remember them by. Silica’s only personality trait is her affinity to animals, which isn’t much. I liked Lisbeth when I watched the show because of her short pink hair and how her blacksmithing gave off a tomboy aura, but in terms of personality she really doesn’t have much going for her. It’s interesting that she would go into that career path and even the fact that there are career paths in the game considering the fact that everyone is a warrior class character so things like magic aren’t something you could use to your advantage, but we never really get an explanation for it and she seems to just fall in love with Kirito at first sight despite the fact that their first encounter isn’t all that positive. Asuna is the only character in the series who really has a decent personality. She does play hard to get at first, like a regular tsundere, but quickly it turns into actual love which is something we rarely see in anime.
My enjoyment of this anime was somewhat skewed since I watched it after being recommended it by my cousin who really liked it and so I was convinced this was something I was supposed to like, but even then there were still some things I didn’t really like about it. Overall I did enjoy it, but partly just because I felt like it was the right thing to do. There wasn’t really much of any reasons I had to argue for the reasons I liked it at the time so soon after I disregarded by enjoyment of it as being fake so I’m not really sure what to think about it. If I were to watch it again now I’ve already had my opinion poisoned by everyone saying bad things about it so it’s hard to say if I would enjoy it genuinely or if it would just be laughing at it for all of the problems that have been brought to my view. The cafe scenes didn’t bother me when I watched it, but now they seem like such a blatant flaw like the author had no way of explaining things naturally and just relied on exposition scenes which he thought would best take place in cafes.
Overall it’s a fairly average anime. It does a lot of things right, but it does so many things wrong that it cancels out. The concept is interesting and the music is amazing, but the poor characterization and bad execution of the story turns everything back to average. Would I recommend this anime? It’s an anime that’s considered an important one to watch despite the fact that the quality isn’t that high, but it’s also not one I personally think you need to feel obliged to watch if it doesn’t seem like the kind of thing you would enjoy.",5

                Sword Art Online is one of the most controversial anime released in 2012. Since then, anyone how has watched this is on one of two parties. One side say that they love this anime, despite its flaws. And the other side basically can't  see anything good about this anime and only the flaws that this anime has. 
Now I watched this anime quite recently, as I never heard of this anime until last year. Everyone told me that this was a ""must watch"" or something in that nature. Now, I'm going to be honest, I tried to like this anime. I did. But it
                  just pissed me off on how bad I thought the anime was.
The story is about a new virtual reality game that just got out on the market called Sword Art Online. It follows a guy named Kirito as he tries to make it through the game safely, as none of the players can log out and if you lose it will cost your life. On this journey, he meets and falls in love with the female lead, Asuna.
From a glance on the outside, it seemed like a really good plot. As a fan of MMO's I was interested in this and considering how much it was recommended to me, I decided to it a shot. But I didn't know what was to come as the story falls into a downward spiral or nothingness. The story was WAY to rushed and put time skips in when it wasn't needed at all. I would have been fine without them, I would have watched the first arc even it was just a season or two alone. There is too much time wasted and condensed to 15 episodes, which by the way was mostly filler. I liked the first two episodes, as were on track. After that, I didn't like where they show went in terms of story. It focuses more on filler than the story itself and that's what gave it a major turn off. As for the second half, it wasn't the same. It was more of a horrible story line and there was focus in the wrong places. The second half wasn't as rushed, but still had similarities to the first half. Also, the story focuses on mediocre plot lines. Kirito and Asuna's romance? I felt like someone was shoving their religion down my throat. And all the others involve nothing to do with the main story itself, like fishing. This honestly feels like a really bad fanfiction, to be honest. I hated that useless plot points became the main plot point. I was expecting a more psychological and philosophical approach to it. Honestly, that would have been a way more jarring story than how it was presented.   
Now the characters weren't really that good. First, we have Kirito, our main protagonist of the anime. He is more of a loner and anti-social type who likes to spend time playing video games, more than interacting with people in real life. He is hardly interesting as I continued to watch this show. He was too OP and he had plot armor that you anyone could smell a mile away. In the game SAO, it's shown he can perform moves that humans can't normally do. Then, you have Asuna. She appears in the second episode, who is a new player but could play fairly well. At first, I thought she was going become a bad ass female lead, which I liked. Considering her first appearance, I can probably say most people who didn't like this show can agree. But as time goes on, she can't do anything without her fucking boyfriend and has to rely on a man to save her all the time. I didn't want no remake of Twilight for fuck sakes. And all the supporting cast as well. When they get there chance in the spotlight, all of them somehow end up falling for our anti-social hero, including his cousin.And I'm dead serious on that part. All of the females are weak and useless and literally can't do anything without their FUCKING BOYFRIEND, aka Kirito. Seriously. 
The animation was really well done for this anime. And it's one of the only things I really enjoyed. The action shots put into this was splendid and overall great. The boss fights, which is one of my favorite scenes, were great. But other than that, there is nothing else to say about it. 
The sound to the anime, however is also a disappointment. The first opening to this anime was good. Other than that, the music wasn't outstanding and none never stuck out to me, which made it worse for my experience. Now for the dub, it was really bad in my opinion. Bryce Papenbrook was bad at portraying Kirito, not that it matters, because I hated his character anyway. The other characters either didn't make a huge impact or they I learned to except them. Since I listened to the dub, I would suggest the sub because frankly I couldn't care less about the dub at this point. 
Overall, this anime wasn't very good. The plot takes it's turn and focuses on a twelve year old sight on a romance. The music was invisible and the VA work was horrific. But, there is one thing I forgot to mention. Even though, this show was a complete disaster for me, I still wanted to get to watch this show. Maybe it's because I wanted to see how this terrible show wanted to end, who knows. The point is, this anime isn't for everyone. It's more for the shounen fans out there. There is so much better animes out there! Please don't waste your time on this.",6

                Arguably the breakout hit of 2012, this is a weird, messy work. It’s full of risible elements (little sisters, invincible main protagonist, waifus, the entire second half) that make it inexplicably annoying and bad… and yet. At least for the first half of this series, even with the random diversions and stuff that’s awkward, I still managed to buy into its love story. Or, rather, I bought the idea of it, as something that was necessary for both of those characters. The real time element of it (how they actually stay 2 years in the game) is what eventually sold me on it – if
                  they have to stay this long inside the game, why not make something beautiful of it? Of course, this turns out to be complete wish-fulfillment idealized domesticity nonsense that wouldn’t fly in a more serious work; but, here, it mostly works.

                Okay this is my revised/rewritten review for SAO and just in case you already read, I encourage to you reread it and give it a second chance. I decided this would be my first review simply, because it is one of the most controversial subjects in anime lately. I'm gonna include a link at the end of the post that discusses all the controversy that has been going on about SAO, so I don't clutter up what I actually want to say.
I'm gonna start off by saying that SAO is not an anime that you can watch impulse by impulse. It's something that must be
                  viewed as a whole. It's  story meant to show character progression and development over time. Try looking at the big picture here.
Story(7): I'm gonna start off by saying no, the story isn't bad at all. It is really enjoyable and keeps you interested and guessing all the way through. The first couple of episodes are what get you sucked into this fantasy world and what comes next is what makes you stay. It's story is not as bad as people make it out to be. It has a little bit of everything to appeal to a lot of viewers and still ends up staying true to it's core. When it switched from the first arc to the second is where viewers tend to get a bit confused. The really fast pacing at the beginning messes with our expectations. We expect to see the characters slowly adapting to life in their new world. For better or for worse, the fact that the show basically fast forwards through that whole segment threw a lot of viewers for a loop. It's not to say that some aspects weren't predictable, because certainly the second arc does have a tried and true plot device. However saying the entire show is predictable is ignoring everywhere it blew our minds.
Art(10): I thought the art in SAO was exceptional. It caught my eyes from the moment I saw it and it makes you want to see more. The backgrounds are really beautiful and the art is overall really pleasing to look at.
Sound(10): The sound was also another strongpoint in the series. The intro and outro songs were really good. And the music was where it needed to be, when it needed to be. It made the action scenes really awesome and enjoyable.
Character(7): Alot of people say this is the worst part about SAO. The thing is that, it never did anything wrong and people tend to jump to conclusions when they don't know what they are talking about. The show displays the characters change very well over time, in and out of the VRMMOs. Kirito becomes more mature and man-like out of SAO as expected out of anyone in his shoes. Also, the supporting characters are exactly as they sound. They're there to add to the story and develop the main character even more. And are brought back to remind people that they are still alive. What ends up confusing people is their mixed feelings about the main protagonist. They tried to make him please everyone, while also confusing the viewers with all these aspects about him. It was a love or hate sort of thing.
Enjoyment(8): I really enjoyed SAO. As it was a really good and enjoyable show. Most people tend to confuse what did happen with what could've happened and that's very bad. You have to enjoy the show for what it is, not for what it could have been. Nothing is perfect and there will always be flaws, but in the end what really matters is how much fun you had along the way.

                Ok while overall this was a very enjoyable experience even tho this anime certainly had its flaws. In fact this review will most likely have many flaws itself considering its my first time writing one.
 SPOILERs may follow
 The
 artwork
the art is very solid, tho nothing to write home about. Where it really shines is during the action sequences. Especially when there was a boss fight. The final boss was especially great. I mean to get away with such a large open battle field and so many characters being involved and not lose quality was really something. Overall normal non-action sequences were a little lack
                  luster but are forgiven when considered how action oriented I considered this to be.
Sound
english voice actors
i don't know much about music but i found the intro to be quite enjoyable and match the show. Now I did not watch the original Japanese version but when compared to other dubbs/subbed works all I can say is.....meh it was alright. Kirito seemed to match his character pretty well and stand out above the crowd when compared to the others excluding Asuna who I thought did a brilliant job and was some great casting work on there part. the rest of the cast seemed a little plain to put it nicely. And Yuri i might add was a little annoying yet fitting for her age. 
Story
( semi-short summary of first season)
main protagonist: Kirito 
   OK now story has its originality. Gamer finds game. Gamer does beta. Starts actual game. Then he's stuck.Oh and if you die in the game you die in real life. Nice start I was hooked he then joins a guild beats first boss only to find out how pissed people were at people who were in beta because they had a major advantage in this life and death game. The show had a basic action vibe and I loved it. The Dynamic art style during fights certainly  helped.
    Overall the first few episodes go like this he goes through the game being slightly over powered. Loses friends because of that fact. Kirito had the bright idea of joining a weaker guild. It doesn't flat out say the trap they set off was over powered because of this but I have my suspicions.
   It was then we got a taste of what was to come. Enter Asuna a head strong character who would put the show on a 360 in terms of plot. Don't get me wrong she had a great character design its just we came for a action anime not some freakin' love story. BUT i'm getting ahead of myself she doesn’t flat out ruin it until the second(half of the first) season..... Ok ruin is a strong word more like change he feel of it. Kirito and Asuna then solve a murder mystery. Gets a little lacking in fights but had a good air of drama.
   Then Asuna's guild leader demands he join there guild because he was stealing alot of her time away. So Kirito challenges him to a duel he win she can leave without any worries. Kirito loses he joins the guild. (MAJOR SPOILER) He loses, not without trying I mind you. It was a amazing fight.  was when I fell in love with it all over again and it keeps up the pattern in fights through out. It is when they take out fights all together that I get annoyed. He then under circumstances I wont get into gets her anyway. 
   Enter the lovey dovey faze they the (SPOILERS) they get in game married and then the show hints that the bowchikawowowed with the what I like to call Asuna's pink hand of rape  technique. Don't get me wrong I love romantic animes but the problem is its just like wolverine (movie). odd comparison I know, but I think it still holds true. We all came hoping this would be action/gaming anime but the second they get into the cabin it turned into a love story. For like 3/4 episodes I mind you and no fighting this whole time.In both wolverine and this we came for the action and it turned into a chick flick for awhile at least.
   We then get a kid who is slightly cute and annoying who we don't see until elfhiem (probably spelled wrong) which I don't plan on reviewing unless this does well. All the big players in the game then take on the latest floor of the dungeon . This finally gets the show on track and leads to a awesome boss fight reminiscent of what the show seemed to promise. all just to have that become slightly empty when the (Spoiler)  game master finally
shows himself as being one of the players in a kinda unconventional way, which to me seem to take meaning form what they had done in the past. he then challenges him to a winner take all match where they were freed and the creator of the game dies.
   This then spills over into elfhiem when some of the players (including asuna) are left behind despite the fact sao was stopped.
   To quote myself and summarize ""In both Wolverine and this we came for the action and it turned into a chick flick for awhile at least"". It did everything right up until the romance. Romance would have been fine if they didn't over do it, it had kind of became to much of a break from the action. I understand they needed a solid base behind Kirito's practically obsessive actions in elfheim yet they didn't need to do it all in one chunk. Overall 7/10 is a good number watch able yet not perfect.",7

                Sword Art Online is the perfect example of an entry-level anime. The disappointing part is that not all areas of the series is mediocre. The art was often very impressive, lots of great futuristic features and animations that made the series interesting to watch. With that, the series had a lot of potential with the storyline. However, the storyline ended up being EXTREMELY inconsistent and all over the place. There were some implied time skips that were confusing, characters coming from nowhere, along with other inconsistencies. Reading the synopsis and actually the first couple episodes got me really excited about the series, it's such a
                  great concept but the places they went with it didn't make sense. They also through in some romantic crap that wasn't believable. They could have condensed the random side stories into one enticing main plot. And it really shouldn't have continued past episode 15, but it did anyway. Although, again I have to give props to the animation, the character design, and sound. The series is watchable, but didn't go in the direction I think it should have.",5
"
                EDIT 6/30/2020: I've changed up my ratings a bit since I made this when I first started watching actual anime. I gave a lot of bad ratings to other anime back then as well. I'm a lot more chill about all anime now because I can always find enjoyment in something no matter what it is (pot helps). But I still stand by this being a great starter anime. It's what brought me into this crazy world of anime and I have now watched literal months worth of it (check list). SAO has a lot of flaws, but if you're a fan of MMOs I
                  think you'll like this a lot more than others. I still think everyone can enjoy it though. It really sparked the whole genre of isekai (normal person transported into another world). The thing is Kirito isn't necessarily normal, he's just a pro gamer (which does make them better than everyone don't @ me) and a great guy. The story feels very rushed and I wish they would've did a lot more through the entire tower, but it's still good. Though I am disappointed that this made me read the light novel years ago hoping they skipped stuff in the anime when they didn't, it just wasn't there. Every anime is edgy and has a few annoying characters. You can't get past that in Japanese things at all. I would 100% recommend this to anyone wanting to get into anime who enjoys video games and I might recommend it to someone getting into anime in general depending on their tastes. A lot of people give this show hate for being average, but as a seasoned watcher, I say AT LEAST above average and enjoyable for sure. I'm still following the show today and I plan to continue. I still think it's very enjoyable and Kirito is still one of my favorite characters. Updated ratings to match this edit.
THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPOILERS. Also, this is my first anime review on this website. First off, this is the first real anime I have ever watched(not counting DBZ, Pokemon, etc.) and it really did impact me a lot. I only started watching anime maybe in April of 2015(not too far from when I was typing this. It is one of those anime that once you finish, you will want to find more and more anime. At least that's what it did for me. I decided to watch it because all of my friends liked it and I liked MMORPG's a lot. Ever since this I decided to watch another anime, then another, then another, until I just couldn't help myself from watching them all the time. I mostly watch ecchi anime now, but this is where I started. I have read most of the light novels as well. This is and will always be one of my favorite anime no matter how many times people say it's ""too mainstream"".
STORY:
I'm not going to explain the story because if you are reading my review then you probably read the description and have an idea. It is a very good story that will get you pumped up, excited, and sad at certain times, which is what a great story needs in my opinion. The main problem with the story is at one point Kirito(the main character if you didn't know) will be average level and then it will skip through a lot of the story and he will be strong again and you wouldn’t even know it. There are also a few ""fillers"" in there like most anime, but they are actually things that happen in the book as well so I guess they just tried to put them in there. Overall, I absolutely love the story although it has its flaws, like any other anime.
ART:
It's pretty good, they also change their clothing into regular clothes a bit in this because a lot of people get angry for characters wearing the same exact clothes all of the time I guess. That doesn’t bother me at all, but it really doesn’t make sense that they change a lot since it is an MMORPG.
SOUND:
I don't know what to look for much on sound, but all I know is that I absolutely love the opening song of the first ark, ""Crossing Fields"". The rest are pretty good, but this one is what everyone talks about. Gives me good memories.
CHARACTER:
The main character's name is Kazuto Kirigaya, also known as Kirito. He develops a lot while the anime goes on and he is actually a very good person as well as player. You meet many people too, and they are all great. They all get serious, funny, and bad ass at times which is awesome.
ENJOYMENT:
By this point you already know I enjoyed this anime way too much. I've watched it about three times and I loved it every time. I wish I could unwatch this anime and watch it all over again because I loved it so much and recommend it to everyone.",7
"
                When I first heard about the anime, as a huge fan of MMORPG, I was excited as hell.
Some other viewers might have succeded to do an overall commentary, but it is in my opinion impossible. It is hard not to spoil but I'll do my best to explain what I felt without spoiling.
There are two main parts in the anime, that you can't unsee.
The first one was awesome. The plot was kind of simple, but efficient and enjoyable. The anime and what happend was consistent, and all the MMORPG elements were here, so a fan couldn't feel lost, what is great. At this moment, I
                  felt stressed, scared, and the suspense was important. SAO was at this moment kind of a dark fantasy anime, and not a bad one.
The sad fact is that there is a second part. As I'm not going to spoil anything, it might seem imprecise, but I can summarize. This second part is ways too different from the first one. First by the atmosphere, in my opinion too ""childish"". Then, the total lack of consistence, of logic. I didn't feel stressed, I wasn't afraid for the characters, and the universe wasn't attractive at ALL. It was globally predictible and uninteresting.
As an overall commentary (finally), I'd say SAO started well, but it didn't become what it could have become. In my opinion, it should have stopped at the end of the first part. Second part is a huge joke that ruined the entire anime.
I'd still recommend you to watch it, as this first part worthes the time ; this was for me a great experience. But prepare to be deceived by the end.",6
"
                Hello everyone, tihis review will be based on the first time I ever watched this. I would like to make it clear this is based on the first half of SAO. 
Basically we have a young male teen who calls himself Kirito, his actual name is Kazuto Kirigaya, Kirito like most teens his age loves playing video games. Kirito specifically loves playing Sword Art Online, a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) but one day something unexpected happens. Kirito, like many playing in the same game he is, finds himself unable to log out of the game, leaving him trapped. Akihiko Kayaba, the
                  creator of the game reveals his intentions, he wants the players to clear all 100s floors within the world of Aincrad. Kayaba also states that death in the game will result in them dying in real life as well and any attempt to remove the Nervegear (a device used to allow players to play in virtual reality) will have the same result. Now Kirito has to not only find a way to complete the game without dying but also try and survive the result that such a traumatic experience will have on the other gamers. After all,  many would go to great lengths to ensure they survive. 
Story - First watching this, I found the first couple of episodes very thrilling and as the series went on and we see the effects the game has on different people as they try to adapt to an entire new world, we get to see that not all people are helpful or nice. Eventually we even hear about how people begin to give up on clearing all the floors and begin to live thier lives in virtual reality. I like the pacing of the first couple episodes
Art and Sound - Nicely animated and a decent soundtrack, nothing too special though. 
Character - Asuna - The main heroine. During his travels at the beginning of the anime, Kirito meets Asuna who originally was hesistant to speak to him although agreed to partner up during a boss level fight that many had took part in. After the fight the 2 go seperates ways and by the time they next meet Asuna has shown be just as strong as Kirito is by becoming a high ranking member of Knight of the blood Oath guild, one of the strongest guilds in the game. The two spend more time with each other later in the first half of the season. 
Kirito befriends people many during his time in SAO. One of them is Klein, the very first friend Kirito meets in SAO. Seeing Kirito running through the town, Klein chases after him and asks for help in learning the basics of the game. The two spend some time training and are about to part when Klein realises he can't log out. Kirito also has the same problem, they go back into the town, where Kayaba tells everyone that they are trapped within the game. Kirito, being a beta-tester for the game and thus knowing the best levelling up spots, immediately goes off. He had asked Klein to come with him but Klein decides to remain behind to help his less experienced friends. The two part ways but end up meeting several time during thier adventure in Aincrad. 
I feel that the anime shows the diversity of the people within the game very well, some are nice, friendly but others are evil. an example of this is that some guilds will take advantage of some game aspects to lure out innocent players and take belongings, other groups act like mercenaries and will even kill players knowing that dying in game means death in real life. I like that as it makes the fear that many players have more believable. 
Enjoyment - The first episode does well to give you a rush but after that the pacing does slow down a bit and then the slow drags on which does become a bit annoying. Overall I enjoyed the 1st half of SAO, it was by no means award winning but it was still good, I would ask people to give the first 3-5 episodes a go but I can understand why it wouldn't be everyones cup of tea.  
This review doesn't focus on the 2nd part of SAO because to be honest, it just isn't good, I wouldn't say I hated it but its one of those things that you watch once then avoid for a year or 2 or maybe even 4. Anyway thanks for reading.",6
"
                So... This is my first review. And I'm glad its Sword art online. Let start off saying its one of my favorites so far, And most likely keep being that way. I really don't have that much to say in terms of it needing work. The story has been a little used before, but puts a twist on it. The animation of the anime is fantastic. Absolutely no problems there.The soundtrack for the anime is heavenly. I get goosebumps during some of the moments and the epic music is playing. Pure heaven. Character, there are so many in SAO but their all pretty established well.
                  The only reason I gave it a nine was I didn't want to give it strait 10's across the board. I really don't need to explain enjoyment much. Overall I gave it a good 9.39 or something like that. I guess the only reason its not a solid 10 is because I heard it didn't follow the light novels, and It really irked some people off that it did it. If this inspired you to watch it, (And somehow you haven't heard about it yet) I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",9
"
                My friend introduced me to this anime, and I was surprised - I had never encountered such an anime before involving virtual reality.  The story is very good in that there is much suspense.  There is a good mix of action, mystery, and romance as well.  
However, I feel that the plot is moving a little bit too fast.  The pace is not that bad, but I feel that this anime could have gained more success if it had went a bit slower, like if Kirito had went through the virtual reality game from level to level.  
              ",8
"
                Sword art online was one of those anime that I had a huge personal interest in, only to be disappointed with the story. I won't say I didn't like the story, I was just told it was really good. The main protagonist, Kirito, is probably my least favorite character, because he tried to be a badass, but really, any average joe could be him if they actually tried hard enough. The female characters are also, uninteresting, only because they only got one episode each, exept for asuna, and they didn;t really develop much. The animation I thought was excellent, and got better about half way
                  through the series, and the sound was also great. Although I wasn't very fond of the story, it was strangely, fun to watch. That is until about halfway through, then it becomes enjoyable again after the ""Lovey-Dovey"" section. In total, it isn't a bad anime, I just don't think it deserves all the praise it gets, but it does deserve some prase.",7
"
                6/10
I don't understand the author, you wasted a good story!
I read a preview and I like the story right away, and the beginning was great, but it went down hill faster than I can imagine.
You ruined it by those harem things and chip jokes and boring fights and most of all those *lovey-dovey* moments, FGS they look like twelve or thirteen top.
Anyway, I see a lot of people watching it and loving it but I got to say it's lame, not my type at all, and a waste of a good start!
Beside from that, the art and sound are good, and it's short so I
                  watched all of it  but not into it, I can't.
Overall, anyone thinks of watching it, don't expect too much like I did, you might gonna be very disapointed, but since some people really into it so maybe it just me.",6

                May contain spoilers
When i first started watching Sao i thought it would be some weird anime where  
people play and fight in a virtual game and i didnt really have high expectations 
for it.But my opinion changed quickly when I saw asuna and kirito together.As i kept watching those two's everyday life in the game to reach the 100th floor I started to really enjoy and envious about their realtionship.Their realationship was really special and they made me laugh,happy and sad.The first few episodes were the best and they were going slow but i didnt enjoy when they started to play ALO.I think it
                  they should have stayed and train more and fight all the way to the 100th floor instead of going to some fairy world which was pretty shit.To me those last episodes were a disaster. I thought it got a bit beter when they go to GGO where kirito meets a new girl called sinon.i knida liked and disliked her but mostly dislike.I wishede that kirito and asuna got fight together and spend more time together.When they solved the GGO case they then went back to ALO and kirito and asuna spent more time together in their house with yui.I think the show is getting better and better.I look forward to what happens next :D",10

                Story: 7 (Good!)
The year is 2022, and gamers have lined up on launch day for Sword Art Online, a hotly-anticipated MMORPG that lets players connect to an immersive virtual reality world with special helmets called Nerve Gear. Kirito is one such gamer who's eager to jump back into action, having spent a great deal of time as a beta tester, and quickly becomes friends with newbie warrior Klein. But soon, Sword Art Online's 10,000's of players dicover they are trapped into the virtual game, and the only way out is to beat 100 floors, containing enimes, boss levels, and friends/foes in the game. This animated
                  series has one of the best original story lines, but like all anime, has distinct plot holes. While this is based off a visual light novel, it does skip quite a few key points. Such as Marriage system, the green, yellow, and red, kill system. The pacing of the anime is very awkward, as it starts upbeat and fast first ten or so episodes, but is snowballs as you get further in the series (gets worse the longer it goes). While it does hold confusing aspects, such as going from floor 10 to 55 (wtf?), it does things very well. Genre crossing here is extremely good to, adding the romance of Kirirto and Asuna. Overall the plot holes just seem way too distinct and very confusing, so I give it a well deserved 7.
Art: 10 (Outstanding!)
The art was detailed, and the characters were well animated. The background scenery was impeccable, with many small details that change the entire atmosphere. The animation was definitely one of the strong points in the anime. Kirito was designed well, and looked his age. And Asuna isn't the big-breasted, sexy hot babe anime girl, she is the badass, pretty anime chick. The created them as though they're real, not anything extremely attractive, just nice to look at. This gets a well deserved 10/10
Sound: 9 (Great!)
The opening of SAO is upbeat, and catchy. It has a great tune, and is the perfect song for this Shonen anime. The voice acting for Kitirto and Ashua was amazing, reflecting the personalities of both characters. Ashua's voice just seemed a tad bit to high for her, but overall it was fluent, and the subbed was well done. I recommend you watch this in the subbed version, as it sound cleaner and the voice matched better than the dubbed. 9/10.
Character: 9 (Great!)
The main characters (Kirito and Ashua) are badass, refreshing, and a great couple. They fight well, and both have there indivual flaws. Kirito can be too much of a hero, even if the situation can obviously tell you to back off. Ahsua, can be laid back. These are great, as this avoids the characters of becoming Mary-Sues (characters who are perfect). The one thing that annoyed me the most was the side characters. Seeing as death plays a huge part in this animation, it becomes way to predictable. Think of the worst possible situation (besides Kiririto dying), and it's bound to happen. So, you can bet your ballsack that everytime he is with someone they will die. How am I supposed to care for a character when I just met them? It becomes predictable, and cheesy how Kirito goes on his rampage how ""It's all my fault!"" . While this is besides the point, this is one thing that bothers me in the anime, and I probably should have gave this an 8, but Ashua and Kirito are way to awesome. 
Enjoyment: 8 (Very Good!)
I enjoyed this anime for the first 10 episodes, that is. As I explained earlier the pace is all wrong and snowballs. One thing is did appreciate though, is that the anime didn't end with characters hooking up. This seems how all animatores are ending everything (besides the animes that focus on romance) when they need a 5 minute scenario. I enjoyed it, but somes times I feeled as though I skipped 2 episodes because I was missing some key information. 
Overall: 9 (Great!) 
After averaging the five categories and adding the scores, it got an 8.6. I rounded it to 9 and I feel as though it deserves this score with all the plot holes. This is an amazing anime that I recommend to anyone who is new, or is a long time viewer. Like every anime there are flaws, and this one just contains the handful in with the story. The characters are amazing, art great, and the voice actors did an amazing job. Please view my profile for any other reviews, and comment if there is something I can improve on. I hope you enjoy your anime! Enjoy!",9

                A bunch of players got stuck in a virtual reality, and they had to fight for their lives, that's interesting, but after that, the story is not really special anymore. Plus, the story has many plot holes, the pace is just too fast, so many floors are skipped, however, I can understand, there is no time to freaking mention each and every single floor, not to mention the fact that we don't know if the original light novel has much more story or not, because even if it's writing, it can be pretty tough to come up with some events and bosses for each floor.
                  But they could have at least made some sort of connections so viewers won't have this ""What the hell happened"" feeling.
The art is certainly very good, the characters look attractive, the background is nice, the shadow, the light, the animation, everything's good.
The musics are good too
This anime is fun to watch and it's really excited at some specific moments. You will have good time with this anime :)",8

                First of all, im a newbie for writing review and my english not that good, sorry if there any grammar wrong or anything about english.
I used to hate Sword Art Online very much. ""Why the game already end?"" ""Why there's a new game but the name is Sword Art Online?"" But, after I rewatch it with my cool head... ""Oh, this is a good romance anime with a little harem""
1) Story 9/10
9 Point? Really? Yes! This is the reason: If you used to watch the trailer you can see the action when Kirito fought the boss with great Animation. And on Episode 01 you can
                  see the Kirito Slash that monster with great Animation too... So you must expect this is an Action Anime... But its wrong, this is a Romance Drama Anime, not an Action. When I Rewatch this anime i had a same feeling when I watch other great Romance Anime. If you hate Romance Anime or Harem Anime this anime not for you.
2) Art 9/10
No need to explain, maybe you all already know the Action Scene with great Art
3) Sound 8/10
The Sound is amazing, with great music, and cool sound when log in or show the menu.
4) Character 7/10
This is the worst on this anime... I like Kirito I Like Asuna but I hate the Kirito Sister... its only my opinion.
5) Enjoyment 10/10
I really enjoy it! You will get the feeling to want more from this anime.
6)Overall 9/10
Overall it's 9 Poin, it would be great if it's only on Sword Art Online and no that Alfheim blabla... And I hate that Kirito Sister.
That's all, Sword Art Online is disappointing anime but a good anime, its not that bad like other say. Everyone didn't like Sword Art Online for nothing , you know!",9

                This review has been re-edited.
""Levels are just numbers. In this world, strength is just an illusion. There are more important things.""
Sword Art Online, one of the most watched animes of 2012. Let it be said that Sword Art Online is a personal favorite of mine. However, looking at all the reviews tells me one thing: there are haters and lovers of the show. The things that haters are saying often involve the sentence, ""It's so overrated"", while the lovers of the show say, ""This is one of my favorite animes of all time, it's so good!"". I can agree with both, yes, Sword Art Online
                  is overrated, and it is very good. But overall, the show deserves a lot of credit overall. People that hate the show are going a little overboard if you ask me. This show was worth watching, and I was happy I did.
It's been a while since I've seen anything involving being inside a videogame. Last time I've heard of a storyline similar to that was when I was watching .hack// and that episode of Yu-Gi-Oh where they get trapped in the online Duel Monsters game. In other words, the story has been done before with similar concepts, only in a way, different. The entire story is based off of the main characters trying to escape an MMO without dying. For me, that sounds like a heck of a lot better then the life I'm living right now, some may agree with me, but in all reality, that would be horrifying, knowing you may die from playing a simple game. They do a good job presenting the life of the players over the 2 years they're trapped, but there are multiple time leaps. First it's summer, then it's Christmas, then it's a few months later. It isn't until around episode 5 or 6 where they start a steady timeline. Overall, the story is what intrigued me to start off.
The people who designed the anime did a spectacular job making this. The artwork was absolutely breathtaking. It really looked like a videogame world, they had the main menu, the inventory, the skills, the worlds, the monsters, literally everything most MMOs have. Not only that, but the scenery was amazing, tons of changes to make it look cooler every floor they go up.
There will soon be an english dub for S.O.A., and like most of the fans, I'm really praying they don't screw this up. The japanese dub was awesome, tons of emotion in the characters, but when it comes to dub, that's when they lack in the emotions and realism. We can only hope that when the release date comes, it doesn't turn into Judgement Day. As for the SFX, really good. Again, the designers made it seem like a videogame, so it sounds exactly like one.
So many characters that I liked, only a few that I hated. In all animes, there's always that ONE PERSON that you can't stand, whether it's Shinji from the Eva series or Itou from School Days. Always. That one person that I hate fortunately doesn't come in until over half way through the series, but if he wasn't in it at all, they'd be cutting the series short since he's the vital character that makes up the plot of the second half. Anyways, main characters; we got Kirito, the male lead, the master of MMOs, the ultimately overpowered person in the game. Despite that, I still found him to be a good role. Asuna, the female lead, gorgeous, deadly, a master chef. Literally, she's in like ""The Top 5 Girlfriends"" list, she's practically perfect. There are other characters that come in throughout the series like Klein and Suguha that play fairly big roles, then others that have maybe an episode of screen time, 2 at max. Good character list overall.
I thuroughly enjoyed this series, there wasn't one moment that left me bored, it was full of action, romance, and drama. They all fit well together in the way that this anime goes, and it had a satisfying ending, but now fans of S.O.A. eagerly await the announcement for Gun Gale Online, supposedly Season 3 to the series, but it may not end up happening unfortunately. I will restate what I sad before, this show is indeed overrated, but at the same time it's truly an amazing anime to watch.",9

                (UPDATED AS OF 1/8/17)
This is my very 1st review, don't criticize about it please. The first anime I'm going to review is Sword Art Online. Now, don't get me wrong, because some people don't like this anime, it's seem a popular anime for fans. So whether it's good or not, let's review it.
-(CAUTION: CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!)-
Story (3/10) -
First off, let's started something great about SAO. In the first 2 episodes, the main characters are introduced and faced the main major conflict. 10,000 players are trapped inside SAO and must work their way to escape by accomplishing 100 floors without dying. It seem very scary and challenging,
                  but I'm expecting to see anything cool that can impress me, that 2 episodes's story is very good. However, the story gets awful as you watch episode 3 and more, you wanna know? THE FREAKING TIMESKIP! It ruins the anime and I'm more likely don't like it. Instead, the story needs to gradually progress, not too fast like if you were in the time machine, you went whatever months it is to the future. This story needs slow progress to make the plots balanced. When it comes ALO, it's can be monotonous to any people, but to me I guess it's alright, it seems quite entertaining to watch. However, I think time skips also occurs here (I'm going to check it) and yet I have to give this a 3. I mean, try to take it easy. You're too fast.
Art (8/10) -
The art is pretty amazing, the background seems well done, and the characters arts is great but not the bestest. I have nothing to say about this, but overall the art is impressive.
Sound (8/10)
The sounds used in this anime are mostly great, some of them may seem meh... it's mediocre, but the songs and the soundtracks are remarkable.
Characters (6/10)
It's hard to explain this part, but I'll try my best. You started off with the main protagonist, Kirito, who also a SAO player and the most badass character in SAO series. Cool thing about Kirito is he never gives up and keeps fighting with dramatic moment. I like when he used dual wield skill to defeat The Gleam Eyes and he almost died with few health left, dang man. He's savage.
Secondly is Asuna, also a SAO player and Kirito's partner, this character seems cool and it's known to be favored by many SAO fans. Apparently, Asuna is pretty strong and I think I don't see any flaws of Kirito and Asuna. 
Third is Yui, now I know what you're thinking. I've seen people hated this character. But to me, she seems to be a decent character. I didn't expect Yui equipped a big ass sword weapon and makes me think, ""Wh-what? H-how the heck does she do that?"". Overall, this character is alright, the thing I don't like is Yui sometime can be annoying. Beside, Yui looks cute especially in ALO.
Now let's talk about antagonists, or just villians. 1st antagonist is Kayaba Akihiko, a game master of SAO and designer of NerveGear, Cardinal System, and The Seed. Seem cool huh? In my opinion, he looks quite interesting character and I can't believe how tough this guy is in SAO. Overall, I like this guy by the way.
For 2nd antagonist, here comes Sugou Nobuyuki. A guy who trapped Asuna, remember when SAO ended prematurely when Kayaba was defeated by Kirito? Kirito was free but not Asuna. Apparently, Sugou is considered as pervert, just looking at how much he did something nasty to that poor Asuna. Eventually, it's so satisfying to watch Sugou slowly dies off by getting their limbs and his torso cut off by Kirito, so I obviously enjoyed that part. I can tell many fans hated Sugou, you know. Anyway, this character may seem disgusting but it's pretty entertaining.
And other characters, well. Most of them are great, they're funny and hilarious. But other characters, well, kind of boring.
Enjoyment (8/10)
I almost enjoyed this anime a lot. But there's some flaws while I'm watching through 25 episodes. The fight scenes are greatly action-packed and pretty amazing and it stuns me how great the fighting scenes is because it gives me sensational moment when it comes to Kirito fighting with dramatic scene. The funny moments are pretty amusing for me and others and it seems enjoyable for me. Sometimes I find some episodes boring and that's not a good thing. But overall, I still enjoyed this anime.
Overall (6/10)
In conclusion, I like this anime. Although it's a popular anime for anime fans to watch, not many people liked it, it's just because of poorly written story, and I almost agree with it. But I'm not telling this is not the worst anime I ever watched, I like the characters, the fight scenes, and the songs and soundtracks as well. But the story is just goes WAY too fast and gives lack of details about this story, also there's sometime too many plot holes. So I'll give this 6 out of 10.",5
"
                Sword Art Online seems like such a touchy subject to me in the anime community. It seems like people either love it or hate it. I will break it down a little bit on each factor. 
In my opinion, the story was fantastic. I was new, tense, interesting, and deep. The world was really well developed, and created the perfect example of a gamer's dream or nightmare. Of course, being a big gamer myself, I really loved the concept of being trapped in a game, so there may be a little bit of personal bias on that bit.
The art was solid. I wouldn't say anything
                  about it was particularly impressive, but it was definitely good art. However, I will say that the animation itself was very fluid an pleasing, so there is that.
The music and other sounds were just like the art, not much else to say. Very fitting and solid, but nothing spectacular.
The characters were really great. Kirito was an interesting, bad ass, and entertaining lead, so he was very well balanced as a character. Other lead characters, such as Asuna, were also very interesting to me, and none of them ever felt annoying or ruined episodes.
Finally, The anime was very enjoyable. There was enough action to keep me interested through the whole thing, and even though there is that sudden switch to romance, that was all well written and enjoyable. I really had fun watching this one.
S overall the anime isn't really anything special, in my opinion, but it is absolutely worth your time, if you somehow still haven't seen it. I gave the show an eight because it was, in fact, really good. Just because is wasn't the greatest show ever doesn't mean it wasn't excellent.",8
"
                SAO (Sword Art Online) is definitely one of the popular recent animes out there, and I can see why it is popular. I really enjoyed the series :)
Story: This is one of the strong points of the series. It starts of with a very interesting theme, and it gradually dulls at midpoint and put a sharp twist-turn right at the end. However, as the story gradually progresses, another theme emerges and made the whole thematic aura of the anime change. Personally, I don't like the emerging theme that progresses in the story because I have the impression that the  series will be an absolute
                  shounen anime in which romance theme would be less emphasized. Nevertheless, I rode on with the story and accepted everything that happens, that is why I truly enjoyed it. Aside from the story itself, I also liked how the setting is portrayed. It is unique and one-of-a-kind. The concept of the story is very fresh and new, I can say for a fact that I can relate to the variables, mechanics, and terms introduced in the concept, since I am someone who loves to play games. This is also a factor that truly motivates me to enjoy the series.
Art: The animation is definitely a plus factor since it is in high definition and very clear-cut. It tries to visualize everything in a detailed manner, and it is quite helpful. Everything from places to characters is very well thought of and   sharply defined. 
Sound:  I love the first opening song of the anime, it is quite catchy and upbeat. I think the voice actors of the characters did a great job, they are able to deliver a voice that is well-suited to the characters. 
Character: I definitely liked the characters in the series, especially the main characters. I see the minor characters as an integral point in the series, they are brought upon in order to make the main characters shine. They are the type of elements that gives a better bigger picture of the entire landscape. Metaphorically, if this were a painting, the main object of the painting are the main characters and the minor characters are the very details that emphasizes the focus of the painting. 
I can see a character development in the series. I think the whole point of the story is actually to engage the main character into situations that will change his personality and view different perspectives of life. The fact that the main character bring about a certain change in his personality  throughout the course of the story is the core point of the series. 
Enjoyment: Honestly, when the romance part progresses, I nearly lost interest in this anime. Nevertheless, I tried and succeeded to forgot my failed impression of this anime, and just watch as to how it unfolds. I threw away my biases and expectations while watching this anime, as maybe it is due to this that in the end, I really enjoyed watching it. I don't know if I was satisfied with the ending, but I guess it was just okay. I didn't give it much thought because again, I am not expecting something from this anime, and it suited just fine. 
In conclusion, it is an anime that leaves excitement at first, gradually dies down and shapes up simultaneously in the middle and finalizes everything in the end. It is enjoyable to watch because it is action-paced, and though I am not an advocate in the romance part, it just turns good and well. I enjoyed the series and is definitely a watch!",8

                This is going to be a really difficult anime to write a review on. Not only because of all the different criticisms and hate it gets, but also because the topic of ""being stuck in a game"" hasn't really been a recurrent element despite animes like Log Horizon and No Game No Life. Sword Art Online had been one of the first animes for me that I felt was more enjoyable than quality material. Again as many people have heard about this series, (And I know I'm going to get a lot of both hate and support from saying this but) Sword Art Online is
                  faaaar from being a masterpiece. 
I'll try my best to outline both the pros/cons of this anime based on the order of importance and also clear up all the controversy/bad attention Sword Art Online has been getting. I'd also like to give you a little bit of my feedback and perspective on this anime as well. It's going to be really difficult to explain without spoiling anything and it might get REALLY LONG so I hope you can take this time right now to sit back, relax, and read this anime with a calm state of mind. Forgive me if it gets a little complicated, I'm trying to explain as much as I can without spoiling anything: 
Story - The story envelopes around a character named Kirito who gets stucked in an VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively-Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) because the creator of the game he is stuck in, Sword Art Online, for apparently no reason. With this synopsis itself, I already had two things in my mind during the first episode: 1. Whoever trapped them in the game, must be the main antagonist in the series. 2. This anime is most likely going to have a lot of characters (10,000 people trapped in SAO). However, after watching SAO, I just want to say that this anime is not very straightforward and tends to not pay attention to expectations. 
One thing that people did not like about this anime is that 90% of the characters Kirito meet serve almost no purpose in the story. The reason for all the hate is because viewers like me tend to dislike getting attached to unimportant characters. It's a waste of time and it's ridiculing. I'm not going to lie, I really hated how the first character Kirito meets when he is first trapped will not be seen until 5 episodes later. Also, the way Kirito meets some of these characters can be a little confusing and random as well (SMALL SPOILER: Kirito meets Yui in a forest and there is no real explanation why she was there, but it just kind of happened to a point no one cared anymore). 
Another thing and probably the most important element that people HATED was the fact that the anime shifted themes from survival/action into romantic/slice-of-life. This could just be because viewers are not used to sticking to more than multiple themes, but what I, personally, thought was the problem with this transition was how it made the anime feel really unpredictable and as if there is nothing developing at all. Kirito is introduced with an antagonist and a situation that he cannot handle. Yet, instead of showing Kirito training or plotting a way to get himself out of the game, the anime had viewers spend at least 4 episodes revolving around romantic themes. Although the famdoms have a point in that action animes with romantic themes are not wrong, you have to admit that most viewers may take this shift as an insult for wasting the viewer's time on what they expected to see. 
The last thing people did not like about this anime is how the ""Sword Art Online"" piece of the 24-episode timeline takes up only 12-13 episodes. The rest of the episodes focuses on another game called Alfheim. The reason why people hated this new theme is because viewers were so used to how Sword Art Online's theme was that when it shifted to something totally different, it was frustrating to try and re-adapt again. 
Now that I cleared up a big portion of controversy of this anime, I'll now talk about the pros about this anime in terms of story. 
Sword Art Online does a good job at creating an antagonist. And what I mean by that is that this anime creates a character that you want Kirito to completely destroy in the most satisfying way possible. Not only was the first main antagonist, Kayaba Akihiko, ruthless, merciless, and intelligent, he was also mysterious. Especially when the story is mixed with a lot of tragedies and characters, it makes the viewers think Kabaya Akihiko is the only antagonist that deserve a ruthless death, or is he really the only one? who knows.
Another thing that I liked was how Kirito was a lonewolf. Unlike most survival-themed animes such as Shingeki no Kyojin, Deadman Wonderland, and Gantz, characters are usually banded together and fight towards a common goal, whereas Kirito fights for a goal of the masses. It's unconventional for main characters to deny the partnership (even Azuna at times) of other side characters, especially when it feels they can achieve a lot of things together. This not only shows how bad ass Kirito is, but also makes his goal much more personal. 
Sword Art Online also made the gaming-theme very relatable to today. The whole mmorpg feel and nostalgic themes we still play today makes certain routes and opportunities this anime takes a lot more interesting. I won't say gamers would love this anime because it's about a game since it defeats the whole purpose of the story being important, but I will say that this anime not only takes into account gameplay, but also incorporates the programming, graphic design, and game-like themes into the story itself. 
In all, Sword Art Online's story is treacherous, yet entertaining. The anime will make you believe things you want to believe, but the outcome will always be something different. However, the way Sword Art Online potrays the unexpected is done in an entertaining manner. Sure, the romance was super random and stupidly transitioned, yet it did play an important role in the story and made you love the characters more. And yes, you will wish that one character did not die, but you will not regret how the characters move forward from it either. 
I gave the story a 7. Unexpected, sometimes ridiculing, yet very interestingly set-up. Expect the unexpected and try to bear with it.
Characters - The characters in Sword Art Online is where a lot more confusion comes in. There have been a lot of random characters that have done almost nothing yet still live on to Sword Art Online II, and there have also been a lot of characters that could've done much more to the story but just haven't. However, what is good about Sword Art Online is how they put most of the pressure on the main character, Kirito. Kirito is the character that is truly driving this anime. There are no side stories or filler episodes of random people, the focus is only Kirito. 
Again, because of this, there is a lot of confusion. Because Kirito's actions drive most of this anime, whether it's choosing to meet another character or fighting bosses, etc., you don't expect anything much from the other characters to truly take a stand and push the story a different direction. Because there are just too many side characters to list, I will simply say that the side characters are going to be nothing but side characters. They will be shipped, loved, and remembered by viewers and famdoms alike, but they will never truly ""take the wheel"" and turn the focus to them. 
One topic of controversy everyone has with the female characters is that they all seem to find an interest in Kirito (and I mean ALL of them). There has not been a female character that Kirito has not flattered or presented a likable appeal to. Many people consider this anime to be a harem in some way and I can only say that that claim is justified. It won't bother you too much, but because I, personally, find it unrealistic, it wasn't preferable. 
Delving more into Kirito's character, Kirito takes on the persona of a bad ass, a fragile little child, and a victim. He is a character that you cannot truly idolize yet hate. He is simply a boy trying to survive the game with his past experiences with the game and avoid death at all costs. Even though this anime portrays Kirito in all emotional states and forms, you cannot truly say you can relate to him. Unlike animes like Naruto, Death Note, and Code Geass that explain to viewers what's going on in the main character's head, this anime does not make that similar approach for viewers to understand how Kirito's mind works because this anime is created in 3rd person. Viewers do not know what Kirito is thinking or what he is going to do next. Our reliance on this anime on what Kirito may do is if he says ""I'm going to the hospital"" or ""I'm going to kill him!"", etc.
In short, I can only say that this anime made me feel very distant to what's going on. Most of the things that were occurring before me were not personally shared with the audience or at least not from Kirito at most. The side characters are very interesting but not all of them play important roles in the story. Because Kirito is driving this anime, the side characters are nothing but supporters or simply characters that have some correspondence with him (yes, I even consider Azuna a side character, especially in Sword Art Online II). I still gave the characters an 8/10 only because each character is unique and do not represent themselves in bad light or cliches. Though they lack the importance of ""taking the wheel"", they are all well-designed characters and differentiate in unique ways that make them all so lovable and unforgettable even though it feels they should be.
Art - The art is really impressive. The characters are designed in such unique ways (especially the armor and weapons) that you can immediately tell which character is which by looking at them (for example, Silica and her pet dragon). What I find very interesting is how the artists/illustrators don't lose track of the differences between virtual reality and reality itself. Whenever Kirito is in the game, you can tell based on the fantasy-like themes and the bright vibrant colors only a game would exploit, contrasting to the boring reality Kirito is in when he takes off his NerveGear and flashes back to the real world. 
One flaw to this art is the 3 dimensional CGI, it's not as impressive as the 2 dimensional approach, but it won't bother you as much. 
Sound - I really liked the music in Sword Art Online. It's nostalgic, feelzy, bad ass, and well-paced. The music always matches the situation and I have little or no complaints with it at all. The style of most of the sword art online music, especially the OPs, move towards a beautiful, graceful, and melodic approach rather than something fast or action-y as reflected in its genre. Even though there is so much tragedy and death going on in the anime, the music always suggests beauty and happiness rather than regret and despair. I guess one can say it's relief to what goes on in the anime.
Overall Enjoyment - Like I mentioned before, Sword Art Online prioritizes entertainment over anything else. The action scenes were epic, the romance was sentimental and b'awww, the enemies were bad ass and crazy, and the side characters were lovely. There is nothing in this anime that was executed horribly. Every scene was well-done to its full and maximum potential. Although the foundation of the anime and the direction it was moving itself was horrid and confusing, the way they went about with it made up for it every time. I don't understand why this anime got so much hate, it was still an enjoyable anime. I zoomed by these 25 episodes so fast that I immediately went straight to Sword Art Online II and already caught up with that one as well. Every episode was interesting in its own way (yet not as satisfying - there's always some annoying cliff hanger or unnecessary scenes) and made me want to know what was happening next every time. No matter how annoying it was, it was indeed very bearable. I sincerely recommend watching this anime if you are not as critical or taking it way too seriously. This anime is meant to be something to enjoy - a definite sit-back-and-relax type of anime you would watch when you're bored on a saturday night doing nothing but typing anime reviews all day and rotting away the weekend. (ha...) 
I hope this review not only helps you understand what Sword Art Online is like, but also clear up all the hate/controversy about this anime for you.",8
"
                At first, I have a really serious reason why I rated this anime how I did. Believe me, I do not waste 10 ratings for ordinary things.
Almost every anime (especially shounen) gives us the impossible actions, but there was something special- the love. I absolutely didn't expected it in this series. This anime'd seemed very usual to me, but then it crashed. Their love made me believe absolutely. Believe in the power of love again. I don't know how they made me cry about their story so much (I'm not a kind of guy who cries over stories very much). This is opinion very subjective...
                  I can say it change my life a bit. The combination of details of story, of characters of Kirito and Asuna, that all suits me very well. 
This story has a gigantic force on me and that's why I took so much from it. If you want to be stronger, if you want to believe that the will (with power of love) can break every rule, every system, this is for you.
I hope I'm not the only one, who feels this.",10

                So in this review so i'm going to tell you some of the problems that i had with this anime and give my opinion on how they could have improved

there are way too many pointless characters in this show, like i feel like they tried making this show a harem anime but halfway through decided ""screw it KirtoxAsuna is the hot trendy thing for the show so give the viewers what they want"", which didn't seem to work out that much because half of the first part of S.A.O was almost over and Kirto and Asnua had little to no development and instead of
                  being ""almost real people"" they were just ""the couple you knew were going to get together because you wanted them to""
Also maybe this was just me but I never really understood what the motives of any of the main characters in the show were. Like in the beginning it was all about getting through the floor and beating the final boss and making it back home, but after Yui gets introduced our mains just want to settle down and decide to call and quits and live out the rest of there days inside a virtual prison.
[How They Could Have Improved]
Take out every single person that's not going to be very useful to the plot 
so no more harem (sorry Kirto) and now use all of that time that you would have used on pointless characters, on wait for it, the main people in your show that are not very like able in the slightest.
[Story]
One of the worse things that S.A.O did was that it was just too damn long, like it had a really good place to end and it didn't take it and it suffers because of it.
So not should it have ended halfway through. it screws with the characters again by taking Asuna out and replacing her with Kirto's sister, like GREAT more people that will fall madly in love with Kirto for no reason.
Taking out Asuna in the way that they did was that she wasn't even an important character anymore she just turned into princess peach and was not who she was in the first half.
[How They Could Have Improved]
basically follow the show how its been going from the start introduce the the boring people that shouldn't be there in the first place blah,blah,blah get up to the floor where they battle the commander and kill of both Asuna and Kirto and the commander and that sets everyone else free (you can have the bit where they are saying goodbye to each other at the end as that would work) they body kiss one last time and they disapear into pixels and then the entire series ends. No elfhiem, no gungale it just ends and hardcore fans might have cried for the next year.
but that was if you did it right....and for me.you didn't.....at all",1

                Virtual reality - one of the wonders that the future can possibly hold. Virtual reality gaming has started giving way to new possibilities in entertainment. Here, death is nothing but a minor inconvenience, for you can just come back and try it again. But what if the convenience of respawning was taken away? This is one of the reasons why Sword Art Online begins so effectively.
NOTE: Summary at the end. (Conclusion)
It begins very simply. Explaining the rules of the game Sword Art Online with zero thrill with a general feel of safety and the goal of being inside the world is clear: It's all just
                  to have fun. These are average everyday people. However, things go awry and the logout button is missing. The creator of the game, Kayaba Akihiko appears and reveals that the only way to escape is to complete the game and if they die, they die permanantly.
The beginning of the Aincrad arc is a masterful piece of work, showing how everyday people suddenly need to cope with a life or death situation. Some people can't take the pressure and go insane. Others have a strong resolve to complete the game. Soon enough, they get to together and form up. This results in a society not unlike a post-apocalyptic one. There are those who go to extreme ends and kill other players in order to survive.
All this is shown throughout the first 7 episodes and gives Sword Art Online a lot of potential. The focus of the series is on Kirito and Asuna. Both of whom are fighting upfront clearing out levels upon levels of bosses. Their time with each other is fun to watch and it has a certain charm to it and shows just what lengths they'll go through to protect each other. The filler episodes that come up next help you give an understanding of the society that people live in, showing the promise of a wider scale.
Unfortunately, that promise is never fulfilled. Rather than opening up to the promise of meeting various people in the world and seeing how they adapt, the series skips two years ahead, and thus, skips through the potential journey to be had and the meaningful character development. What's more, it gives us a smaller understanding of the people who are forced into the  virtual world. There's not much action to be had, either. The boss battles are mostly skipped and left unshown.
However, one can just say that wasn't what Sword Art Online was intended to be, but rather, it was intended to be the relationship between Kirito and Asuna. And in that light, Sword Art Online excels. There is a lot of development for Kirito and Asuna and they have a charm to them. Over time they grow. And just like everyone else in the world, they're scared.
Now without running into spoilers, the ending of Aincrad feels rushed. Without much combat shown and a cheesy way to victory. Not to mention the characters other than Kirito and Asuna were underutilized and had minimal screen time. But despite that, I loved the Aincrad arc. It's artwork was amazing and the story was dramatic. Despite the flaws, missed potential and missed personal preferences - it all doesn't matter as long as I've enjoyed it a lot.
ARC 1 RATING: 9/10
=================
Now how did the rating go all the way down to 7? Well, the answer lies in the next arc - The Fairy Dance Arc.
Unfortunately, the next arc feels very forced down the throat. It features an overlong damsel in distress story that lacks thrill. The threat of death is gone now and there seems to be little reason to prolong the series. But instead, they do. In the end, it manages to be entertaining *enough* to pull me all the way through. I can't describe the Fairy Dance Arc further without spoiling Aincrad. So, the review ends here.
ARC 2 RATING: 6/10
=================
CONCLUSION (TL;DR)
All in all, Sword Art Online is decent anime to watch, but be prepared for a huge drop in quality along the way.
Averaging my ratings for Arc 1 and 2...
OVERALL AVERAGE RATING: 7/10",7

                I see a lot of hate for this anime, and to be honest I see why. The story is rushed and the characters aren't developed that well. But, overall, I still give this anime a high score. Why? I'm not entirely sure myself, but I think it's because the first time I watched it, I couldn't stop.
Like half the characters in the anime itself, I fell in love with Kirito almost immediately and I always wanted to see what kind of epic move he'd pull next - from taking down super powerful enemies by himself to solving completely unnecessary mysteries. Kirito was the kind of
                  guy I want to be. He was powerful, smart, and easygoing. Yes, I understand that the actual content was rubbish, but I think that most of the actual episodes and characters were fine but just needed a bit more to them, or a bit more in between. 
I didn't like Asuna as a person much, but her relationship with Kirito made my heart soften. They would do anything for each other by the end, but how they got to that point definitely could have been developed more. Also, Yui was absolutely adorable and I loved her to bits but her character had obvious holes that, again, could have been developed better.
The plot itself started well, but the unnecessary time skips made it hard for me to watch the second time around. In fact, although I could barely put my laptop down the first time I watched SAO, I only got to episode 8 the second time before I had to quit and reevaluate my life. What was in the anime was good, almost great, even - there just wasn't enough to justify half of what happened later on.
The animation was amazing, I will admit. As SAO was one of the first anime series I ever watched (like, two or three years ago) I think it was the animation and art style that got me completely hooked on anime. The soundtrack I loved as well, because it simply added to the dramatic nature of the series that I already adored.
Possibly the only reason I have such fond memories of this anime is because it was one of the first ones I watched. When I started, I wasn't looking for brilliant character development or fantastic plot lines, just something I could quickly watch, fall in love with, and take from it a reason to continue watching anime. I give this anime a score of 7 overall because of this; my little heart skipped a beat every time I got a chance to watch another episode when I first watched it, and I'm glad for that because without it, I wouldn't have had to inspiration and motivation to watch all the wonderful anime I've seen in the fast couple of years.
So yes, I do agree, there are many major flaws in this anime. It isn't something that an anime veteran will enjoy. It is, on the other hand, great for beginners. Because of that, I will always hold a special place in my heart for this series even though I have recently come to realise it isn't quite as awesome as I once thought.",7

                This anime is one of the most painful examples of a good idea gone wrong yet people often recommend it as a good anime to watch if you are just getting into anime. Do not watch this anime but instead look for a similar alternative such as Log Horizon.
Story: 3/10
The anime is set up with a good concept and a nice world setting that could have been used really well to build a great anime. Unfortunately the writers of this show managed to create the worst paced and badly compressed story I have ever seen. One episode to the next jumps past huge amounts of
                  time and places sometimes even entire years. The original set up of the SAO story is quickly abandoned and replaced with an even worse story line that shows little except how op and boring the main character is.
This anime would be drastically improved if the main character was replaced and the entire two seasons of SAO were placed in the very first world setting instead of the utter disaster they decided to make.
Art & Sound: 5/10 & 7/10
The character art is at sometimes lazy but the backgrounds and fights are beautifully animated. The sound to go with this is very good with some catchy music and decent voicing. Its a shame this art and sound is let down by literally every other aspect of the anime.
Character: 1/10
The main character is surely the most bland and uninteresting human being to have ever existed. His love interest is hardly any better. Watching this anime feels like im watching the writers tick boxes for the most stereotypical anime character ever. The side characters are a mite more interesting but ultimately the character design is utter shit.
Enjoyment: 3/10
All I can say in its favor is that some of the fights can be cool to watch. In truth the only reason I watched all of this is because I was still new to anime and didn't know what to expect.
Overall: 2/10
I only rated this a 2 so I can now go rate its second season a 1",2

                * THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPOILERS* 
Okay so I am literally in tears as I am writing this review so, please bear with me. 
STORY:
This story takes place from the perspective of 15-year-old self-insert character Kirigaya Kazuto. And if you are a gamer, you are sure to love the premise of being trapped inside a video game. 
ART: After being stuck in the dark ages with shows like JoJo it's nice to finally see something refreshing in the art department as presented by this artwork of an anime. Seriously, this anime immerses you into the game of sword art online quite elegantly. 
SOUND: 
Unfortunately, most of the lines don't hit as hard unless you are watching this dubbed. Lines such as, ""If I die in the game, I die in real life!"" only brings the CHILLS by watching the English dub.
CHARACTERS: 
Kirigaya Kazuto, more often than not referred to as Kirito, is quite possibly the best-written anime protagonist in any series ever. His ability to get his gang out of trouble in any situation without failure is stellar. And of course, the best-written character of all time deserves all the females. And boy does he get them...
He is also the best swordsman ever to be created, far better than Guts from the way too gory manga called Berserk. Kirito is the real black swordsman that Guts could only dream of becoming.
ENJOYMENT: 
Asuna is extremely cute! I love her and I love everything about her! Her hair, her laugh her voice, they're all to die for!
Kirito is literally the coolest MC ever created; he makes Guts look like a little baby.
Every single season of SAO was amazing, they all have their own unique stories and cute girls!
So, what else can I say other than ""10/10!"" 
OVERALL:
Calling this Anime ""Outstanding"" is an insult. Even daring to refer to this as an ""Anime"" is a gross oversimplification. This is not just high art; it is quite possibly the highest of arts that will ever be created by man.",10
"
                As most of you know there are light novels for this series, all of which I have read. And this has been perhaps the best read I've had in ages.
The storyline, characters, vastness of the world and romance between Asuna and Kirito are perfect, and the twists will leave you dying for more. If you're here for an anime with a great storyline, have played any RPGS or enjoy a little romance mixed with action and suspense, then this is the anime for you. Although there has only been 4 episodes (at the time of this review), the anime has covered a substantial part of
                  volume 2 in the sword art series, so from here on out the main and incredible storyline will be followed. The animation is beautiful to say the least, and will no doubt accurately represent the amazing setting from the light novels as well as the character models. The voice acting for the main characters Asuna and Kirito have been spot on (of course), and the sound quality is overall, like the animation, perfect.
As I hinted at above, the story will have you hooked from the beginning , I'm sure many of you have played RPGS, and if you died in those RPGS, you'd respawn and try again of course. But in this anime, the RPG becomes real life, if you health bar drops you're killed almost instantly in real life. With that kind of premise, this anime will be very suspenseful and engaging. I'll focus on the main characters for now because most of the others haven't been fairly introduced yet. Off the bat you can tell Kirito isn't the average anime protagonist, he chooses to go solo for the sake of his own survival rather than stay with his ""noob"" friend and protecting him in the VRMMORPG. This might seem like a shortcoming, but in the novels he quickly changes upon meeting Asuna (his main love interest+party member), and becomes a character you'll love. Asuna is very strong willed and at first seems to contrast with the anti-social and awkward Kirito, but we later find out how similar they are, and their relationship is perhaps the best I've seen in any other anime or Manga.",8
"
                Sword Art Online is a two pronged story divided into a very good arc and an okay arc. The first arc is the very good arc that is centered around 10000 players trying to escape a game where if they die then they die in real life. The second arc is about one of the players from the first arc trying to rescue his love. With that being said lets go into the review
Story: 6
I give the story a 6 and that is due to how different both parts are. The first part is very superior to the second part and builds up a better
                  story and drives the plot more efficiently since every character introduces is trapped in the game, thus strives to return to reality. In the second part only one character is trapped in the game thus taking out a conflict which everyone can get behind. If I could I would give the first part a 9 and the second part a 3, but since I cannot I will stick with a 6.
Art-8
Art was pretty good. The landscapes and battle scenes were expected and typical but still had the ability to impress. So I'll give it an 8
Sound-10
Sound was where this series really took flight. The soundtrack was really only instrumental based but still set every scene perfectly. If you can you must buy this soundtrack. It deserves a 10
Character-4
The character's were below average, due to the series only really focusing on 3 character's while they had the possibility to expand on two entire worlds, and just chose three characters. Out of these three two felt rushed and only the main hero was fully developed. A 4 is being gracious.
Enjoyment-8 and Overall-6
I liked this series even with it's downfall's. It is not a hard series to sit through and something you can use to get your friends into anime. Overall I give it a 6. This to me says, you should try out 5 episodes and if you don't like it then drop it.",6
"
                We all know that SAO sucks. While not the worst anime in existence, I bet there are worse. Its still crap. From being boring, cliché, retarded writing, pointless arcs, and finally just making a terrible game to go with it. I can safely say this is the worst anime I have seen to date. just go watch the abridged version on YouTube. The only good thing to come out of this is two things. One, it is on of the first anime I've ever seen and thus lead me to other better anime. Two, it had a great concept that could have been used amazingly
                  if given to the right people. Also every villain in this series is just not thought out. I dropped the second season realizing it was just vomiting up the first season.",2
"
                Sword Art Online (popularly known as SAO) is a survival game in which players in the game must finish all 100 levels to be free from living in the game forever. The story revolves around the player, Kirito, who is desperately fighting his way to the top level to survive.
Story - 9: The story was unique. One aspect I loved in this story is the video game resembles a lot of other MMORPGs today. A bit off topic but throughout the whole anime, I just kept making connections with SAO and Maplestory. I felt like this element to the story made it so enjoyable. The
                  story, despite being a survival story, has a fun and relaxing feel to it. There is a lot of romance as you get into the novel and connections with the friends Kirito makes along the way. The story definitely deserves a solid 9. The only reason why I felt like it didn't deserve a 10 was the fact that there were some skips between episodes that felt a bit awkward. Some characters just appear out of nowhere honestly and I understand they're minor characters, but try to elaborate their part in the story. Also so characters whom which are also minor,  really play a role for one episode or two and then sorta just drift away from the main storyline. I want to call them filler episodes, but I don't think that's the right term. Interesting characters, but not always necessary introductions. One final part that I found a bit cliche was the second half of the story. I don't want to give away spoilers, but I felt like the second part of this anime was really cliche. It wasn't really unique as the first part. I enjoyed it but I was a bit disappointed. (NOTE: I'm not talking about a second season or a OVA)
Art - 8: The art and animations were great. Some of the sword fights felt a bit slow only because the attacks were essentially single blow fights. But otherwise I loved the art. It was clean and crisp. Solid 8 for sure.
Sound - 7: The sound was good. I can't really think of any special sound that was really good. The music to the anime sounded really familiar. A lot of the BGM felt like it was following similar notes to other songs that I cannot name. They were enjoyable none the less and were fitting.
Character - 8: The character development was good. The reason why I wouldn't put it as high is the reason I didn't give the story a 10, Gaps. I felt like in a lot of the characters (including Kirito) there were gaps in the story that didn't explain enough. Of course they're not large enough to deter from a good understanding of who these characters are but still gaps. All the characters really make you feel. Either happy, sad, or mad when you see them. They are somewhat cliche characters, but I guess you don't need to fix something that isn't broken...right?
Enjoyment - 9: Loved it. I enjoyed all the episodes up until the second part. That's the biggest reason why I can't give a 10. The second part was fun to watch, but it wasn't as grasping as I thought it would be.
Overall - 8: Solid 8, I thoroughly enjoyed the anime and would suggest to anyone looking for an adventure type of anime. It's definitely worth watching.",8

                Sword Art Online is absolute (got deleted for cussing last time) (oops), and everyone knows its (oops). In fact, one of the only reasons its so popular is because its famous for being (oops). The characters are poorly written, the exposition scenes are boring as (oops), and the story, while seeming interesting at first, is taken in the worst possible direction imaginable. Sword Art Online is objectively one of the worst mainstream animes ever made, so why do I keep watching it?
Part of me watches it and cringes within every scene. Asuna is seemed to be strong and independent in the beginning but is made
                  into a pathetic little (oops) throughout the story. Kirito is supposed to be a loner and struggle with social interaction but is actually really (oops) good at dealing with people, and the rest of the characters are just part of Kiritos embarrassing desperate little harem and don't really contribute to much. Everyone is so stupidly generic it makes me giggle a little.
I'll be honest, I have no problem with OP characters. In fact, I love OP characters, but obviously, only the well-written ones. Kirito is probably the worst OP character I've ever seen. He's way too smart, way too strong, and everything goes way too well for him. He has essentially zero actual development and the whole purpose of his existence is to impress more stupid (oops) so he can add to his harem. He's absolutely terrible, but I still love the (oops) boy.
So what did you learn from this review? Nothing, you learned nothing. Nothing new at least. But I will tell you that once you get over your anime superiority complex about how your taste is better than everyone else's, you will be able to enjoy wonderfully (oops) animes like sword art online. It really is addictive, and I will never be ashamed for my absolutely terrible taste. Peace out (oops).",10

                This anime has been given a really low overall rating but i loved the anime personally;
Story:
I really enjoyed the story line about people getting trapped into a futuristic game online, although at the beginning i was a bit confused because it didn't  make any sense for them to be trapped, anyways i liked how the story continues because it is fast pasted and at times sad and then happy.
i also thought that the second part should really have been a separate season as they didn't really connect at all.
but overall the story line was great (Y).
Art:
The art was modern and slick, especially the
                  fight scenes; they were amazing!! I also like the design of the clothes within the game, i really liked Kirito's coat.
sound:
i enjoyed the openings and endings to the anime, i think they worked really well with the genre.
i also liked the music that they used in certain times in the anime because it really set the atmosphere and at times made me want to cry!!
characters:
i liked the characters, they were well explained and there characteristics suited the characters (such as kirito's was kind and warm hearted whereas Asuna's character was stern and a bit grumpy at the start of the anime).
i really enjoyed this anime because of the characters, plot and drama! 
even though this is a ""shouen"" it is very feminine and romantic . (Kirito cries a lot, and i mean A LOT). 
overall i give it an 8 because i enjoyed the anime and the reason i didn't give it a 10 is because at times the anime left me confused and wondered why they added certain scenes to the anime,
hope this helps!!.",8

                First MAL Review, please lie and say you like it. Anyway.
Sword art online story is one of the greatest premises I have seen so far with a very high potential to be something great, but it does have its flaws.
The story is overall great and i really did enjoy watching it but i can't bring myself to say its the best thing i've ever watched because the lack of character development and jumps in the story. The jumps in story were somewhat inevitable because you can't fit the whole series into a short or even moderatly sized anime and even if you could, it would
                  become really repetitive and the creativity and feel would run out but, in doing so the characters emotions change at the blink of an eye so we can't have a complete story on them or understand there changes in personality or even fully understand that personality for that matter.
The art could of been better, it had a moe feel with wasn't my style personally, but it did fit, maybe a different style would of worked better. I'm not sure, that's personally up to you.
The characters, primarily kirito, were very bland and generic but with the few insights in their personality and how they acted, i somehow found myself filling in the lack of development with my own life or people i knew who fit it.
Overall its a great series and it kept me entertained, but it is a long way from being a masterpiece.",6
"
                Score is just my personal opinion. Nothing to be agreed upon.
But yeah, show's great. Not everyone will like it. Some will find it boring as hell. Some might even consider it offensive, who knows. But that's normal. You don't like a show, you give it a low score on MAL and go on with your life.
Mind you, I said ""normal"", and that's not you. You're here to shit on SAO because someone on wannabe youtuber told you to. You probably haven't even watched the show. Like, is this really how you wanna live your life. Pull yourself together, man! You're better than this.
              ",10
"
                Let me just say this up front: If you don't like Kirito as the main protagonist, you're not likely to enjoy Sword Art Online.
A lot of people go into the plot of the show at this point, but I'll pass considering that the summary above will do a much better job that I could muster. Besides, you are here for the review and the recommendation, not for the plot since, hopefully, the plot of interest thereof has brought you here in the first place. Oh, and there are bound to be some out-of-context spoilers...I apologize.
So, why did I like Sword Art Online? To put it
                  simply, I enjoyed watching Kirito and Asuna's story unfold. Interestingly, I came into watching this series late and with very low expectations. A friend of mine recommended it to me, but with these words: ""The first two episodes are great, but 3-7 are kinda meh. But it gets really great again in episode 8!"" Not the highest of praise, is it? But I think it helped me to appreciate the entertaining story-telling that was taking place. 
The premise itself was intriguing, ""10,000 people trapped in a video game where death was real."" and once Kirito and Asuna found their romance, I was hooked. I loved their relationship and what I loved even more was that Asuna never took a backseat to Kirito. Maybe people may argue otherwise, but the way I saw it, she was always right beside him, and in many ways, she provided him strength, both emotionally, and as a reliable warrior who, in Kirito's own words he ""...could never match in speed or accuracy"". I love their relationship in that they visually showed that they LIKED each other, something a lot of Japanese couples in anime tend to shy away from. They even get married! How cool is that? As a married woman myself, it was nice to see something so rare as a married woman protagonist. Asuna was strong, beautiful and protected Kirito as much as he protected her. At least...till the second half...
Now, I can deal with Asuna being a damsel in distress. I wasn't pleased by it, but I could deal with it. Heck, in a way, Asuna ""saved"" Kirito in the first season by being someone who he could love as an equal  and who ""wouldn't die"", so it was fine that he had to do the saving this time...it was even neat to see his single driven passion to rescue her. No...if there was a problem with the second half, thy name would be Suguha. Nicknamed ""moe-boob"" by me and my husband, Suguha was the thorn in what could be one of those epic romantic rescue love-story type of things. And really? Did she HAVE to be all incest-y? I honestly believed that I would like her character better if she had just fallen in love with Kirito in the game only, and not actually liked her brother-cousin irl. It would've been a much more sympathetic reveal. It also would've been nicer if, as his sister, she would've been his support in rescuing Asuna instead of being her eventual love rival. *sigh* It was a stupid plot line that the show could've done without. And it could've certainly done without the ridiculous, and excessive to the point of ludicrous, Sugu fanservice. The show went from mild to -BAM- boobs in your face! If you made that a drinking game, your liver wouldn't last till the final episode. (And really, why the dancing??? Gah!) 
Rant aside, I like Kirito and Asuna enough to watch their adventure to the conclusion. Yes, everything female tends to fall over backwards for Kirito, but he's far more attractive and likable than the average harem protagonist, so I don't really understand the hate. Either way, it provided me with entertainment in both cheering and ripping on the show depending on the situation. So, who would I recommend this show to? Someone who's more of a casual watcher and doesn't hold anime up to the level where every show must be a masterpiece of great art. This show is by no means a masterpiece, but I don't think it was ever supposed to be. It was a fun ride, and I enjoyed the adventure.",7
"
                If you like romance and video games you need to watch this anime, it starts with Kirigaya, Kazuto which his online game name is Kirito the main protagonist of the series, in SAO he is a Solo player
who hasn't join any guild and usually works alone because of the death of his previous guildmates.
In Episode 2 he befriends a girl and party with a girl by the name of Yuuki Asuna who later becomes his lover.
I think what it really comes and was just the fact I enjoyed watching it and the end of watching this anime will keep entertain me and keeping me interested
                  because I also like playing video games especially evolves MMORPG.",10
"
                This anime was really well executed, Especially for those like me, who are fans of video game/survival-themed anime.
Story: The Story consists of 2 arcs. While the first arc was REALLY good the second wasn't as bad as some might make it out to be. Both arcs didn't mess around and the story is always progressing and keeps you at the edge of your seat.
Art: The art-style and character design was nicely pulled off. I personally liked that in SAO the people used their real looks but the elven twist in ALO was good as well. Looking forward to seeing GGO animated if ever it's happening.
Sound:
                  The Soundtrack was AMAZING. It captures the epicness of the moments when it needed to and sets the sad atmosphere when things were going badly. The OPs and EDs were very good as well.
Character: Kirito wasn't too original in terms of main character design but he was well pulled off. But what really amazed me in the character design was his romantic relationships. It wasn't like your typical anime where everything is a harem. It had legit love story even if he spent time with multiple women. It seemed a lot like western-style writing rather than anime.
To conclude, I REALLY loved the series and is now one of my memorable favorites. I hope that Gun Gale Online gets animated so I can enjoy more of this.",9

                I think this was a very good anime in my opinion. Most of this story is really heart wrenching. It can be very tragic most of the time, but there is also some happy moments. It is very predictable most of the time though. If something good happens, something bad happens right after. I have to say this is a really good anime though overall because I usually don't like romantic stuff. I think the romance in this anime was very well done. Overall I recommend this anime, but be prepared to almost cry at some parts :C

                The thing about sword art online is the art is pretty good and the story is creative but there are some important details that should be questioned. Why did kirito and Asuna fall in love all of a sudden? And how? To be honest it looked to me like Kirito watched Sachi die and didn't really give a fuck. Plus at the beginning, he told Asuna that he didn't wanna partner up with her but then joins a guild. That confused me a lot. And I think it should of had more moments with his other sword art online friends, not just Asuna. And all
                  of a sudden Asuna is in another game in the middle of the anime: How and why? Also the anime would be more interesting if they met Yui in real life also. And in the other game that popped up in the middle of the anime, how is kirito so good? If he is not high level, how is he so strong? How is his stats high enough to defeat strong people? I think the anime rushed too much having them play that game to survive. the creators probably rushed over the anime and didnt catch the details. Well its possible. Other than bad opinions, ill say good ones. The music is really good and the opening 1 is really catchy. The art is also pretty good. It's not that bad, pretty fun to watch. I hope the next season is better.",7

                This show is the pinnacle of isekai anime. Everyone should go through the experience of watching sword art online. personally, I think that before someone is allowed to access the entirety of anime they should have to go through the experience of watching anime. Sword art online is a good twist on the isekai genre and it sets the bar for anime to be high but not unreachable by others with a decently likable art style and a relatively likable story being a good benchmark for the typical type of ""overpowered mc"" story. 
sword art online is an anime you can look back on and
                  reflect ""ha I remember watching sword art online I love that show"". sword art online is genuinely such a funny goofy goober show that you can watch as a great beginner anime. everyone I have ever known has loved sword art online and as I am me I only associate with the most intellectual individuals so you can know that I have some good sources. If someone negatively rates this show you can be sure it's because the two brain cells in their head weren't capable of counting past the number 4. sword art online aka ""decent fiction"" is definitely a must-watch for all anime watchers.",8
"
                Looking at the overall score I gave this show, you're probably thinking ""How the hell do you like SAO?! SAO is shit!""
Well, let me tell you.
Story- 8/10
The story for the first arc goes as such: 10,000 people are trapped in a video game, and if you die in the game you die in real life. Seems basic enough. However, basic isn't always a bad thing. It's a solid story line, and the way they execute it is nice.
The second arc, however, is a bit of a problem. It goes from a cool, kickass story about survival to a perverted, incestuous damsel-in-distress story. WTF Reki Kawahara?
But
                  I still gave the story an 8/10 because of how good the first arc was.
Art- 10/10
This and Sound are where this show shines the most. This anime was produced by A-1 Pictures, which is also well-known for making Fairy Tail and Blue Exorcist. I think A-1 Pictures did a good job on those shows, but on this show the art and animation were flawless. The art was bright and colorful, the character designs were nice to look at, and the animation was fluid.
Sound- 10/10
I'm just gonna say it now. It's impossible to give the sound for this show anything below a 10. The soundtrack was amazing, I loved every song from Crossing fields to Swordland. The voice acting was amazing as well, and he English dub isn't that bad.
Character- 7/10
You can guess why the score for Character is so low.
Yup. Sugou Nobuyuki.
Without spoiling anything, Sugou is a terrible, perverted rapist with a fetish for young women and no likeable qualities.
But besides that, the characters are pretty good. I understand that Kirito is OP as hell, but he does a good job of portraying the ""beta tester"". I loved Asuna's character until Fairy Dance reduced her to a damsel in distress. The side characters were pretty cool as well, such as Klein, Lisbeth, Silica, and Agil. Heathcliff was an awesome villain as well.
Enjoyment- 9/10
This was the first anime I ever finished, so of course there's gonna be some nostalgia involved. Putting that aside, however, Sword Art Online was an anime series that I thoroughly enjoyed. It was cool to see the character interactions as they work together to escape the death game.
Overall- 8/10
After seeing all the hate, I thought this anime would be terrible when I first went to watch it. However, I quickly realized that this is far from the worst anime ever. If you're one of those people who dropped it after two episodes, keep watching. I promise you won't regret it.",8
"
                I love the pure amount of hate that this show gets, with the haters outnumbering the fans 2 to 1 on MAL. 
STORY- 5/10
Of course, the first three episodes were everyone's favorite, character development, world introduction, formalities done. And then it feels kinda like filler for 2 episodes and then straight into the romance. People say this is the worst thing ever, but I think that what happened was that the creator tried to combine shounen action and slice-of-life romance and comedy into SAO, and ended up with a mess. Then the second half occurred. It's biggest problem was that it was too serious. In
                  Aincrad, people took it seriously because one could legitimately die. Here, Kirito just acts like an idiot and near-sacrifices himself multiple times to save his friends, when all he's really doing is saving their ability levels. That and Eugene's entire army betrayed him :P
ART- 8/10
Nice fight animations, good character designs (or at least they look cool), nice coloring, everything you expect out of decent animating.
SOUND- 9/10
I've heard a few anime veterans say that Yuki Kajiura kinda disappointed in this show's OST, but I think it's pretty good. Decent voice actors (and a half decent dub, as far as they go), great music, memorable opening songs, SAO did this part well.
CHARACTER- 5/10
Another point of hate among MAL viewers- Kirito is a generic overpowered badass and Asuna is a tsundere that's useless without her boyfriend (in the immortal words of Gigguk, long may he reign). Kirito does get a bit more character development than people say he does (like, a bit, not a ton), but this section was kinda disappointing.
ENJOYMENT- 7/10
I'm so glad comments aren't enabled for reviews, or people would butcher me so much for this. SAO wasn't a show you would enjoy if you thought too much, so you could kinda compare it to a Micheal Bay film- good music and effects but bad story and characters, except this maybe wasn't as bad. 
OVERALL- 6/10
Like most anime reviewers you'll find on the internet, I would say that SAO wasn't as good as the fanboys say, but not as bad as the haters bash. It had its good and bad, and people just pay attention to the bad apparently. Worth a watch, but don't expect too much out of it.",6
"
                Imagine being trapped inside an MMO where the game ceases to be one and every random battle could be your last, this is the world of Sword Art Online.
It's hard to talk about the plot of the show without going into spoilers so I'll try to keep it brief, the original concept is a pretty great idea, though for such a dark initial premise and despite it's sometimes sinister moments it keeps quite a light-hearted attitude. Where it stumbles is it's pacing, it loses a lot of tension along the way and story threads and dramatic revelations that should have perhaps been expanded upon can
                  often feel a little rush and not treated with high enough regard. The show is a lot more romance based than the synopsis lets on, it's this aspect that is given the most reverence throughout it's run, certainly there are moments of action and mystery, but it's something to be kept in mind before tackling this series. To be clear this isn't a negative point against SAO , the romantic plot threads are handled well for the most part, but I'll expand on that when I talk about the characters.
Kirito (the protagonist of the series, though not his actual name I'm sticking with the most commonly used one) is a little bland overall, he starts off relatively interesting in that he isn't the self-confident hero who is without flaw that is commonly seen, unfortunately a lot of his character development is quickly glossed over in time shifts and he ends up being somewhat of a smooth talking juggernaut by the end of them who perhaps speaks in a few too many clichés. Asuna, the female lead, shares many of the same problems, though she brings a little more humour to her scenes to make things less dry.
The supporting cast (with the exception of the main love interests) on the other hand are where the series falls down in terms of characters, essentially anyone else interacting with Kirito falls into two camps they either want to be with him or be him, again this is probably due to him becoming a little too perfect in later episodes but it's a shame since there some fun personalities in there who could have been explored a little deeper and given a bit more screen time.
The villains are rather hit or miss, for the majority they are little flat and their motives quite simple, that's not to say there isn't the occasional exception in the bunch and even some of the more boilerplate threats have sinister moments, but again we don't really spend enough time with the majority of them to really get inside their heads.
That being said the main relationships explored in the series are for the large part well done, progressing in a naturalistic and believable ways for the most part and even with my cold dead heart I found myself rooting for the main duo in some of their struggles. It's these moments where the dialogue and emotional elements to the characters shine, as they reflect on reality and what is truly real.
The graphical style of the series brings nothing particularly new to the table, that's not to say it falls down in any major ways or has any real noticeable flaws, it's just the best I can find myself saying about it is that it's strongly competent. The fight scenes are when some real fluidity and energy are injected into the action, though these are fewer than you'd expect judging by it's settings. The CG is blended in quite well for the most part though it still stands out in contrast to the more traditional animation, I suppose you could say because these elements mostly show up in the MMO segments that it's intentional but that seems like a bit of a stretch.
As a romantic fantasy based show with some light science-fiction touches to it is a fun ride though a very uneven one, it's the investment in the relationships that will pull you through the series and though the set up is a unique premise it will probably leave people a little wanting in terms of detail and depth and is an idea that could have been treated with a little more grandeur than it was here.
Thanks for reading, this is my first review so any tips or criticisms are appreciated.",6
"
                The anime was able to hook people in the series, and did prove to be an enjoyment watching. But after reading the novels and looking back to what the anime is, i need to say that besides from the enjoyment of boss fighting scenes, the anime is not really that good.
The first two episodes filled in the missing parts of the novel -  the beginning of the story and the first floor. But then the timeline is just simply messed up by the production team, jumping to two side stories. The first includes death kirito's first love, then immediately followed by a side story
                  with another girl. How the f in the world did the production team thought that its a good idea? Sure it did filled in gaps as the first novel actually started at floor 74, but is this sequence even logical?
All i can say is that the production group just messed the timeline so hard that it is just painful to watch in the sequence they have. The side stories are enjoyment reading, but time sequence f everything.
The second arc is not bad in the story itself, but again the way the production team presents is just a pain in the ass.
Read the novel if you can have access and time, orelse watch the first few episodes in the sequence of 1,2,5,6,8,9,10,13,14, then fill in the side stories, and then follow with the normal sequence.",8
"
                Ok, I have to say that SAO was probably one of the best anime I've ever watched. The storyline and the plot of this anime is actually very good since its not just about an RPG game online that gets boring afterwards, a completely unexpected things happens in the story that changes the plot from just being a normal game to something that's very enjoyable. 
Although, I do have to agree with some people that the main character is a little too overpowered, and its basically like saying that he doesn't have any weaknesses at all and if you do find his weakness, he's eventually
                  gonna find yours and set you straight. 
Love story for this anime was actually very touching and I don't know if I'm just soft-hearted about these things but love that actually has a meaning while trying to survive in a virtual world is just as amazing as a regular one. 
This is one anime that I hope you all watch and watch again.",10
"
                If you love(d) playing MMORPGs, and wished you could up the stakes - make everything more real, and that everyone would take it more seriously - then this is the premise that likely brought you to this series.
The premise, and first couple of episodes, are fantastic. It's a really cool idea. I wasn't even that big into MMORPGs but I bought into it.
***SPOILERS TO FOLLOW***
But that's about where it ends. Much the way Gurren Lagann threw their whole show out the window and basically restarted halfway through, SAO does the same. They reach about halfway to the conclusion of the plot, then decide to end
                  things prematurely and change from an interesting show (albeit with a lot of filler) to this weird creepy real-life situation with incredibly creepy and incestuous themes/overtones. The fanservice is ridiculous and unwarranted, and frankly it feels rapey.
In conclusion, if you enjoy MMORPGs and wish your sister had the hots for you, you will love this show. If you don't, you'll have the craziest blue balls when about halfway through they abandon the premise to focus on what is and isn't acceptable for a sister to feel about her brother.",4
"
                I enjoyed the series substantially.  I agree with many of the other reviews that its greatest weakness is the characters.  Regardless of this weakness, it still remains a wonderful series.
The concept is fascinating, and that comes from someone who has specifically avoided MMOs since Everquest.  They have never interested me, but the story and concept nonetheless kept me in the story.
What I would like to point out, particularly towards the end of the second season, is that the score and orchestration are quite powerful and appropriate.  I have studied music most of my life (I work as a pipe organist), so
                  I generally pay close attention to the quality of music in the background of movies, television shows, and animation.  The score worked brilliantly to set the mood for whatever situation the characters were in.
This series seems to be one of just enjoyment.  There isn't any earth-shattering thoughts it provokes:  it is a simple love story in an interesting world.  And for that, it did its work brilliantly.  If I were truly looking for something thought-provoking, I wouldn't be looking into this series.",8
"
                Sword Art Online, an adventure, fantasy, and romance (with hints of action) anime about what it is like to live in a virtual world. Think of combining Oculus Rift with Skyrim, and you get the idea. Main Hero Kirito, a beta tester in the game, is caught along with a couple thousand other players when the game creator disables the logout feature, and tells them that ""It’s not all fun and games"" If you die here, you die in real life. 
Story: 2/10
This is my biggest gripe with the anime. The anime starts off well, with the consequences of people dealing with the realistic consequences
                  of death, but being forced to live in a virtual game. How they band together and/or betray another is one theme that dominates. However, it changes flavor one episode after another. There are themes of identity as well as morality crises, and how one deals with real values in a fake world. The anime switches its genre quickly between action, slice of life, and romance by the mid-season. I do not mind that the writers and producers sought to include so much in this anime, after all, the basic setup of the story leads to a colossal amount of possibilities. The problem comes in that the writers and producers decided that instead of focusing on a few of them, to just try to include them all. And in the end, Sword Art Online becomes just too confusing. No possibility is explored to its fullest, and the story changes from one setting and theme to another with neither rhyme nor reason. 
Art: 8/10
The art overall was beautiful, and the characters themselves very distinct and recognizable. The settings and background was one part of the anime that the company truly ‘spared no expense’. Each floor of the dungeon had its own art and color theme, and convinced me firmly that I was no longer on Earth. For the entire show, I was quite tempted to actually try SAO, should it be created one day for us. The overall setting evokes the grandiosity of Middle Earth, with hints of the mysteriousness and magic of Harry Potter and Narnia. The only reason I do not give it a 9 or a 10 is because the art and style does not leave a permanent impression on you, the same way the art in Madoka Magica or Kimi No Wa does.
Sound: 9/10
By the time I finally got around to watching this anime, I had already heard of so many renditions of its OST. The opening and endings fit the anime perfectly, and each soundtrack combined with the art flawlessly to create the world of Sword Art Online (alright guys, seriously, step 1: Oculus Rift, step 2: Skyrim, step 3:???, step 4: Profit).
Character (WARNING, SPOILERS): 5/10
The main male character is clearly introduced as a bad-ass, having previously been a beta tester, but he is also introduced with clear character flaws that he must deal with in, order to band together and survive with the other players. The same can be said of the main female character. The reason my rating is so low is because the anime forced my hand. It literally develops the two characters equally well, but then episode 14/15 happens. The main heroine is just dropped by the show entirely, and a new one occurs. And of course, it’s one of the most cliché one’s ever. Get this people, he has a sister that joins him in the game. Cue: Incestuous and Harem Subplot. I would have been totally fine if Asuna was developed as well, and the anime just switched between their simultaneous timelines (like the way Game of Thrones was done), but nope, our favorite heroine suddenly becomes that Medieval Damsel in Distress, and her development just stops. Disappointed.
Enjoyment: 4/10
Overall, the anime itself is mainly enjoyable, as we watch people of all ages and genders deal with their Brave New World, with all its darkness and hilarity. The pacing of the story is horrible, but the story itself is not fundamentally flawed, if a bit disjointed. I enjoyed watching the main romance blossom, as well the occasional fight scenes. The art and sound sort-a balanced out the bad story and character development, second thought, maybe NOT.
Overall/Conclusions: 2/10
Sword Art Online is an ambitious project that unfortunately does not live up to the hype. If you watched Erased, Guilty Crown, or Elfen Lied, and felt that they were incomplete, you will know what I mean. SAO starts off well, but whether it’s the budget or the deadlines, deals the viewer a fatal blow, leaving him/her unsatisfied by the end of the season. The art and music cannot and should not be the saving grace of any anime, and this is especially true of SAO, where they fail to prop up the fiasco that is the story and character development.",2

                To get straight to the point, this series had a ton of potential and I really really like the idea of being trapped in a game. A big problem was that there is little character development. Another point I really did not like that the first half of the series was great, but when they suddenly and unexpected beat the game we are left with another 11 episodes of lame story line. 
Honestly if you watch the first 14 episodes of SAO you can stop at that point. If I had then I would probable have given this series another point or two overall.

                Story: The story of Sword Art Online is not considered good. However, I consider it at least over-average, taking into consideration the setting and characters. I looked through it deeply and I found a meaning for everything, even though there are some holes that cannot be fixed.
Story Rating: 6/10
Art: The art style and quality of this anime is great. It could make an example to every other anime with a conventional art style out there. Animation is smooth, even in anime, and both the CG and drawing have a nearly perfect quality.

                  OPs are awesome, basically all great.

                I've been hearing good things about this anime and since it was super high on the Popularity list, I decided to give this a shot. The result was...very poor to say the least. This anime suffers from so many thing while getting some things right. Let's do a quick rundown:
Story: 4/10
One of the two great flaws this show suffers from. I thought that this anime would touch subjects like human survival, treason, alliances, human emotions in the face of impossible odds. 
I WAS GRAVELY MISTAKEN.
The first two episodes start out great and I was thrilled to see more of this virtual world where anyone could
                  die for real. Then we get episode upon episode of filler stuff not even relevant to the plot. Not to mention several time skips over the course of the anime, destroying what little story was left.
Instead of people trying to survive this virtual deathtrap, we get people that have given up on trying to clear the game 3-4 episodes into the anime. What the actual fuck? The anime rapidly degenerated into a slice of life romance anime with the ever so slightly occasional MMO element.
Art: 8/10
The strong point of this anime. The animations are great and the occasional action scenes are fluid. The character design is pretty good, with interesting choices. Apart from some not that good CGI usage for some action scenes, the art is great and on point.
Sound: 8/10
I decided to give a good rating on the sound because the soundtrack is pretty great. Although Yuki Kajiura's work in this anime is similar to her other works in animes like Fate/Zero or Kara no Kyokai, I like this kind of music so that's not a problem for me. The only issue for me is that the music is trying to sell a crappy anime and hearing some epic music with a mediocre character fighting is not that awesome, but we'll get to the characters in a moment.
The openings and endings are awesome and do a great job of hyping you for the episode, again getting destroyed by the anime itself.
Characters: 3/10
Easily the worst thing about this show. The characters are bland, one-dimensional and do not go through any character development whatsoever during the whole anime.
The main character, Kirito, is the poster boy for the guy who can do absolutely anything. He's unbeatable, he's popular with the ladies (and I mean all the ladies), he's smarter than everyone else and even when he tries out new things, he's miles better than everyone else. He's a literal God in this anime and I'm not even kidding. To top if all off he has absolutely no interesting personality trait. The epitome of a bad main character.
The second ""main"" character is Asuna. During her first introduction, she seemed great. She was strong and seemed to hold her own in this world. That quickly disappeared and she became the token ""waifu"" for the MC. The creators of this show, even went so far as to make the couple adopt a virtual child and treat her as their own child and start calling themselves ""Papa"" and ""Mama"". Again...what the actual fuck?
The rest of the cast is mainly the rest of MC's harem that are ready to do anything to get MC to lower their panties.
The anime tries desperately to include a little shock value by adding MC's first cousin into the mix. She has incestuous feelings towards MC and we are supposed to pass this off as the anime trying to touch mature subjects. No, just...no.
Enjoyment: 5/10
Overall, if it wasn't for the MMO thing and the great animation and soundtracks of this anime, I would have dropped it a long time ago. It managed to get me somewhat entertained at times and absolutely bored to death and cringy as hell other times.
If you're looking into an anime with an MMO subject, I suggest you stay away from this, unless you enjoy mindless harem stuff and ignoring the main plot during the most part of the anime.",6

                I will almost never write a review for something, but I figured I would for Sword Art Online because of how controversial it is.
I would like to add a disclaimer, which is that I have read (most of) the Light Novels for SAO and that may influence my decision. I will try to keep that out of it as much as possible though.
As well as this, my review MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS. I'll try to keep them to a minimum, but there's only so much I can do.
Anyways, on to the review.
8/10 Story - This might be a bit surprising to some people based on
                  other reviews they've seen, but the story in SAO is actually really good.
Part 1 - Without spoiling too much, the premise of it is that a gamer (Kirito) gets trapped in an MMORPG by use of Full Dive technology to redirect brain waves, etc. While this may feel unoriginal (and I could talk more about that but I'm trying to keep the LNs out of it), originality doesn't really matter. What matters is if the premise is good, and yes, the premise is good.
Then there's the rest of the story. Adventures through Aincrad were fun to watch, and the romance was fine. Overall the first half would deserve a 10.
Part 2 - This is where it gets a bit more iffy. Once again, the premise of this is fine (not as good as for part 1, but fine), which, and there may be some spoilers here, is where Kirito tries to save his girlfriend and pseudo-wife (Asuna) from an evil ""mastermind"" (let's save this for the characters section) is trying to... well that's a decently large spoiler so I'll stop right there. Sure, it's a damsel in distress kind of arc, but Asuna at least contributes a little bit. However this part does drop the story score quite a bit due to fanservice, a poor overall story, weird romance stuff (once again, characters... I know), and just being an overall worse half.
10/10 Art - Nothing much to say about this. The art is great and SAO uses my favorite art style for anime soo...
10/10 Sound - The sound isn't really lacking during the series in any obvious way, and the OP/EP music is the overall best I've ever heard from a series.
7/10 Character - The characters are really not as bad as many people say they are, but there's still not great. They are, hence the 7, good. I won't go into a huge amount of detail here as if I do, I know I'll spoil a lot of stuff. Basically the main complaints are:
Villains with bad or non-existent motives (true, but if you're a gamer or creator, you might be able to relate a little kinda ish bit to the first villain. The second villain... can't support him as much).
Main characters with no backstory (not true, but some of the backstory that should be there is missing).
Harems forming around the main character (let's be honest. This is a romance (right?), and so it's a high chance that it's going to have some kinds of harem elements).
I hope I've been successful in clearing some of that up. Anyways, I'd consider this the be a 7 in terms of character. Sorry for being so non-specific, but I know how annoying spoilers can be.
10/10 Enjoyment - I really liked this show. A lot. That's pretty much all there is to say about this.
10/10 Overall - The enjoyment factor is probably weighted as a 12 or 13 for this one (and rounding up), but I think that overall, this show is ""outstanding"", and that if you haven't watched Sword Art Online, you should certainly consider watching it.",10

                Sword art was my first anime (I don't count stuff like pokemon that I watched as a kid on cartoon network). As a result, I'm somewhat biased towards liking it.
SAO has issues. The pacing is off. In a big way. There are deus ex machinas everywhere. I would elaborate more on that, but I think it would constitute spoilers. 
The season is roughly split into two halves. Let's just say that if I told you what they were each about, you'd think I was describing two different anime.
I see a lot of criticism around about SAO. A lot of it is justified, albeit a bit
                  exaggerated in my opinion. A common complaint is that kirito (the MC) is overpowered. In pretty much any other situation I would agree. But seeing that he is a hardcore gamer, thrust into what is essentially an MMO (his forte), while having prior experience of it in a closed beta, I would expect him to be stronger than the vast majority of the other players. But as much as I think it makes sense in the context of the show, it nevertheless detracts from it.
""but if there are all these bad things you have to say about it, why is your enjoyment score at 10???"" - you right now.
The answer to that is: I enjoyed the heck out of this show. The concept of being trapped in a death game appeals to me greatly. Although my biggest complaint is based on that appeal.
I feel like the show squandered its main selling point. SAO isn't really about being trapped in a death game. It's a love story. That is the theme that ties together the arcs throughout the seasons of the anime (and the Light novels they are based on). So if you were drawn in by the synopsis but don't like love stories, there isn't much for you here.
SAO is one of my personal favourite anime's. Subjectively, I love it. I've rewatched several times and still loved it. However, objectively it has awful pacing, wastes a lot of its potential by using it's most interesting character, Aincrad: the world they are trapped in, as a backdrop rather that something to explore. 
The best characters are often left by the wayside. There are people that will say the characters are all very 2 dimensional. I can see where they're coming from. I don't neccessarily agree, but I feel my bias towards the show makes me unsuitable for really assessing this. I've spent a lot of time with them between the anime, light novels and manga. So I've given the character section a 5. I tend to read a lot into even small things and try to empathise with the characters a lot, so there's a good chance i'm really just projecting more depth onto them than the show deserves.
Conclusion: I loved it. But aside from the art/sound, it isn't that good. If you do decide to go ahead and watch it, but dislike it at the end of the aincrad arc (you will know it when it ends), don't even bother going onto fairy dance.",6

                I found Sword Art Online to be more enjoyable, engaging and emotional than most of the other dozen or so anime series which I have watched over the years and was surprised to find such polarized reviews after having watched it.
The premise of SAO is a VRMMO game except that an in-game death would cause death in real life. We are not following people with superhuman capabilities in a world with actual monsters. We are following normal people in a game environment facing a mortal danger that is quite real. As a viewer, I found this much more engaging. While the monsters and supernatural/superhuman powers
                  or technologies of other series have been entertaining they ultimately feel less believable than SAO.
I also believe that the pacing of SAO is one of its strengths. Many anime series follow the hero facing a parade of ever more powerful monsters episode after episode along with a corresponding increase in the hero's capability. I find such series interesting at the beginning but after a few episodes, wish I could skip the grind thru monsters and go to the final climax of the overall storyline.
The first few episodes of SAO imply that it would follow a similar arc. There are going to be a hundred levels that the players need to clear. But then the pacing shifts and we skip thru the normally boring part of the hero's grind. So, it does not show you the boss battle on every floor of the game. It simply implies that such battles have been happening and the hero's skill has been growing accordingly.
Instead, it focuses on the periods of time which are relevant to the relationships in the story. Viewers who enjoy watching ever more epic fight sequences would be disappointed by the 'pacing' when it turns out that SAO skips the grind in the middle. When the pacing transition started it seemed like I might be just seeing some filler episodes or fan service. But it turned out SAO is actually about human connections, relationships, and devotion. What initially appeared to be filler is actually the main story. Part of this was a romantic relationship between the main characters, but there was also a part of the story which was really touching as a parent.
While I started SAO expecting it to just be a fun action anime, I don't remember most of the battle sequences. It was the emotional scenes which I found to be the best part of the series, and it was the resonance of those scenes which stayed with me after it was finished.",9
"
                Just finished all of the episodes... I've wanted to write this review for quite a while now but decided to wait till it was all over. Along with everyone else who thought this anime was going to go down as one of the best, I had high hopes for the anime. It didn't let me down. My review comes from more of an enjoyment standpoint. This anime was a roller-coaster ride of emotion that started high, dipped, and rose back up to expectations after the rushed beginning. 
It takes a unique approach by meshing what I thought could have been two seasons into one 25
                  episode adventure. An important reason I continued to watch the anime  was because it never bored me. It didn't become stagnant and always had a plot to develop that you wanted to see come to fruition. I found myself cheering and smiling most of the time because the main character sets the tone for how an ideal procrastinator would act. Not saying he is boring or predictable in his judgments, rather he is assertive and confident and knows how to handle stressful situations.
If your debating on whether or not to watch this anime. try and look at its rating rather than what people reviewed it as. IMO, I thought this anime was original, the characters were not fully developed but had enough substance, and the plot was not dark nor light but adventuresome. The artwork was also very well done, but some of the action scenes in the first half of the anime were lacking in fluidity (rather resorting to some still shots).
The reason why I rated this anime so high was because of its overall plot quality. The purpose is to take you on an adventure that leaves you wanting more. It makes you feel as if this world could actually become a possibility in the future (even though realistically not for a long long while). It might not be your in your top favorite anime, but it will leave you feel fulfilled and happy, and I think that's a reason everyone watches anime, because its a great feeling when you can relate and feel that sense of enjoyment at the end.",9
"
                I caught this anime on crunchy roll. Im a gamer, but I dont think that is even the reason why I enjoyed this anime. Im a die hard romance freak sometimes and I find it really hard to find an anime that accomplishes that goal anymore. At first I didnt expect this anime to even scratch the service of a romance but when the love between Kirito and Asuna blossomed I was amazed. He was a loner in a world filled with death and when Asuna promised that she'd protect him it was heart warming. I find that sometimes animes drag things out and as
                  a watcher you want things so badly to happen. Like a first kiss and the words ""I love you."" And SAO didnt disappoint. From the moment romance blossomed it just steam rolled like real love should Kirito was no longer alone and he wasnt fighting to save everyone he was fighting so he could wake up and be with Asuna for real he was fighting for the girl he loved. I dont know why everyone feels this anime is stereotypical and only draws in the worst of fans.
Anyone considering this anime should most definetly watch it. This review is poorly done but I wish to avoid spoilers. This anime was solid and it definitely deserves to continue. Although im not sure where else it could continue too, but I actually plan to read the light novels because I feel that this anime like many have will not make it past 25 episodes. 
If you love romance and want to see a boy and a girl find love in a world with only death and suicide. A love so strong that nothing will stand in his way. Then I most defenitely recomend this anime.",10

                There is no words in the English Language to describe how much I hated this show when it first came out. Sword Art Online is one of those shows that is so popular that it could possibly start a war with on one side the people that adore it and on the other the people that want to kill it with whatever means possible. I was on the 'kill' side when the show finished but after watching it again I actually can find some aspects of the show that are interesting and that helped me enjoy its second season a lot more...but Kirito will never
                  be one of them (in the light novels I have slight respect towards him). Warning their will be slight spoilers in this review because you can't really talk about this show without going into that territory (but nothing major):
Story (4/10): Sword Art Online has an interesting (yet not completely unique idea) setting as the first arc revolves around a large amount of people becoming trapped in the anime's namesake: Sword Art Online - a VRMMORPG - where if you die in the game you die in real life and the only way to beat the game and escape is to defeat the boss on the 100th floor. Thus begins the starting point of our journey where we follow main character Kirito on his journey to meet this challenge head on and might as well collect a harem of girls on his way! This part of the show is actually decent with the first few episodes being surprisingly thoughtful and episode 3 being really emotional due to that looming fact that death could occur at any moment which is the main focus of early episodes. Yet, this is ruined though by countless side stories and time skips that make me feel nothing for most of the other characters in the show as they are in 1 episode and then vanish into obscurity. When this arc finished I was actually satisfied with the conclusion (thinking it to be the end) only to learn that there would be another arc (really...?) which made me hope that it wouldn't ruin the what I thought was an okay story...I was wrong. The second arc is like a massive Fuck You to the viewer...but I can't really say much more about it because of massive spoilers but the overall ending of this season is not bad not great but okay.
Art (9/10): A-1 pictures why did you have to do such brilliant animation for such a mediocre show! You deserve so much better! Honestly though the animation suits the show and the fight scenes are incredibly well done considering this company doesn't do a lot of heavy action shows. The openings and endings were also well animated.
Sound (6/10): Whilst I found the opening songs enjoyable I never hesitated to skip the ending songs unless I wanted to view the animation that was done for them. The OST is composed by Yuki Kajiura who is one of my all time favorites but I am sad to find that I only liked 2 songs on this soundtrack 'Swordland' and 'Luminous Sword' which is ironically basically the themes of two characters that I hate! But otherwise the songs didn't really get be pumped up like it did with the Fate/Zero Soundtrack or Madoka Magica one which is kind of sad (but we all have our opinions). I rather watch the show in Japanese because I feel like that version expresses what emotions that the characters have better than the dub. Also I am sick of hearing Bryce Papenbrook in every anime dub I watch...because all I can hear when he voices a character (like Eren from AOT or Shirou from F/SN: UBW)is...fucking Kirito.
Characters (5/10): This is going to be fun *evil laugh* 
Main:
-Kirito: We see the story through his eyes and yet he does not make any real progression in terms of character except that his is an OP Solo Player (which is impossible!) and that he attracts girls just because the story demands it so. However he does fight amazingly and does stuff unlike another certain male lead from another popular anime series (...do ya hear me Guilty Crown! Sword Art Online wrote a better male lead than you and yet I still think you are the better anime) but he also in love with the female lead (who I also hate).
-Asuna: creators...why did you ruin this person. She was hyped up in the first episode she was introduced to appear as a strong and capable despite being a beginner in the game. Then we see her a few episodes later after time skips and she has become a unlikable annoying tsundere that only cares about Kirito. She also is basically Princess Peach for the entire second half...
Others: They are all more enjoyable than the two main characters combined. They have interesting personalities and all the girls deserve Kirito way more than Asuna does!...except Leafa because of reasons...that appear in the second half that I can't mention because of spoilers.
Overall (6/10): As much as I hate on this show along with some of my friends I have to admit that the show is not terrible but its not a masterpiece like some people make it out to be. Its an average show which got a more enjoyable sequel which it did not deserve but its worth watching once to make your choice if its good or bad.",6

                Not a lot of anime are as divisive as Sword Art Online. Some (mostly younger viewers, in my experience) love it like a gift from heaven, while others loathe it with a passion.
Without having seen it, I tended to side with the latter group, as from the outside, SAO looked like nothing but generic trash.
Now that I have seen it, I view it in a much more neutral light. It’s still very generic and quite trashy at times, and while I disliked the show slightly more than I actually liked it, I can’t say that I hate it, either. I guess I’ve become an enlightened
                  centrist, a galaxy-brained ultimate fence sitter.
Most people probably won’t even read the review beyond this point, but let’s pretend you care about my opinions as I shall elaborate on them, starting with the positive aspects of SAO.
I enjoyed the setting. The worlds presented in the anime are beautiful and immensely interesting. While a far cry from perfect, the attempt at portraying a fictional MMO in a believable way was more successful than in pretty much any other anime with similar themes that I’ve seen.
Even though it was kinda ridiculous how quickly the stakes rose to such extreme heights, I didn’t really mind that and thought it worked well as a premise.
So that’s a pretty solid foundation for a show. But the real question is, of course, what they built upon that foundation. The plot, the characters, their arcs and relationships – are they any good?
Well, no. This is the part where I talk about the negatives.
I don’t hate Kirito. There isn’t much to hate about him, anyway. There isn’t much to like about him, either. His personality is best described as: main character from an average anime. 
And he’s rather strong, I suppose. 
Also, if any female knows him for longer than five minutes, they fall in love with him. Not just a crush, but actual, genuine, eternal, I-want-to-bear-your-children-and-live-with-you-forever LOVE.
I wouldn’t even mind it that much, if it weren’t for all these episodes focused entirely on building his harem.
All that time wasted when there was so much stuff the show just skipped over. 
I don’t mind episodes that take a step back and depict what essentially boils down to a side quest. In fact, I enjoy the world building we got from episodes like this. But you still need to show the actual meat of the show. Most of the time, we were lucky to get a throwaway line about the current progress at the so-called front lines.
We never see Kirito get stronger or learn anything during a fight (the scenes where he does figure stuff out, like in that murder-mystery, are among the best in the show). He just brute-forces his way through most obstacles and Deus-ex-Machinas everything else.
The fights are not terrible by any means, they are just never resolved in a satisfying way.
Before getting to my final point, I have a confession to make. I am a total crybaby. Most storytelling media can make me bawl my eyes out embarrassingly easy. Happy moments, sad scenes, it doesn’t even matter.
SAO had an abundance of emotional scenes, mostly typical tearjerker material: people dying, pets dying, broken hearts, not-so-broken hearts...
Yet, when I watched the show, not a single tear was shed. Because non of these scenes had any weight to them.
This is probably what I disliked about Sword Art Online the most: It completely lacked any emotional impact. It was background noise, disguised as an actual show.
All that being said, I will continue to trash SAO whenever I get the chance. Getting enraged fan reactions is just too much fun.",4
"
                Now for an anime that people either really like, or will write an essay about how its bad and is the worst thing ever thinking people actually care about their rants. Well I am here to give a calm and non biased opinion on the show.
Story 8/10:
The story, and especially the concept itself is really interesting, and at the time when i first watched Sword Art Online, about a year ago, it was my first ""game"" genre anime. I recommend this anime to anyone who hasn't yet to see a gaming anime or would like to watch more. Without spoiling anything, I can say this
                  show has many twists and turns that you might not expect, or you might, either way the story is solid and it's a good anime to start on for story if you haven't seen much anime. If you are a seasoned anime watcher and have seen hundreds of shows, this probably isn't the show for you since you will probably see a few flaws within the story, but i can definitely recommend it to most people and especially people who are new to anime, with this being roughly my 5th anime i ever saw, I enjoyed the story.
Art 9/10:
I had no problem at all with the art and it suited the genre well, with the vibrant colours and great landscapes and environments which fit perfectly for a ""game"" anime.
Sound 8/10:
The song has a pretty good soundtrack and I own the OST, however there are a lot of songs that I didn't feel fit very well, but besides those few, the music during the fighting scenes is very well composed and creates intensity to the fight and makes you enjoy it even more.
Character 8/10:
I really do enjoy these characters, with Kirito being my favourite. He is strong and cocky but also has a soft and loving side to him which makes him a really good character. The characters in this show are all unique and id say ""less generic"" then most anime characters in terms of physical looks, It's hard to get a SAO character mixed up with another character, well none that I know off. The only downside to the characters is some of them are slightly sexualised which, i seriously don't think it suits a gaming anime where everyone needs to fight for their lives.
Enjoyment 10/10:
I give enjoyment a 10/10 because with this being one of the first anime I had ever seen, I really enjoyed it and I watched the entire season 1 in just a couple days. The fight scenes and the boss battles should be enjoyable for almost everyone as they are usually really well done battles with clean animations and a lot of action.
As my first game anime and one of my first anime of all time I can say this is a pretty decent show to watch, It's definitely not a 10, and I must admit it's almost an 8 instead of a 9 but with how enjoyed I was watching this, I definitely recommend it to everyone, especially a younger audience in early teens would greatly enjoy this show.",9
"
                Not so much a masterpiece, but I'm completely in love with this.
Story: 9/10
Most people hate this anime because it skips through floors like no fucking tomorrow. But, there's a simple thing these people are forgetting. It's basic psychology. In fact, it's so simple every kid knows it. There's nothing more boring than watching somebody else play an RPG. Imagine how boring that would be, watching them defeat every single floor, how repetitive. The story is fast-paced in terms of time, but the story itself is very easy to keep up with. It actually gives you a sense of progression that makes you want to keep
                  watching. I've watched this anime 4 times over and I never get bored. I think what I loved about it the most, when I watched it the first time, is the mystery of what's happening in the real world. What will it be like when they finally go back? It's so fun to watch this story through and recommend this to everyone!
Art: 9.5/10
The art is so aesthetic and colorful. It's the style I love the most. The animation is so fun to watch and it just gives you goosebumps in every intense scene. The only thing I'm not too fond of is the boss animations; a lot less traditionally animated. But seriously, just the whole SAO world is so attractive.
Sound: 10/10
I don't put a whole lot of emphasis on the sound, but as far as I could tell, it was perfectly fine. I didn't notice any flaws and the anime just flowed perfectly.
Character: 9/10
Interesting characters. The anime is fast-paced in terms of time so it feels as if you're missing out on some character development. It doesn't take long for Kirito and Asuna to get together, non the less, the romance feels flawless. You grow attached to the characters even with these circumstances. It's not ""The romance and character development is good considering how much time they skip between each episode"" but rather ""The romance and character development is done perfectly even with the time skips!"" The second half of this season doesn't have those time skips but still gives you a new character that develops as Kirito develops further with her. And nothing feels pointless. 
Enjoyment: 9.5/10
I can't even help myself. I'm in love with this anime. It does everything so well. Like I said, It's not so much a master piece. It's a different anime and the type with a lot of dissatisfied viewers and critics. But also very unique, creative and it just flows so well. The second half feels a little slow compared to the first half, but it gets there.
Overall: 9/10
What can I say?",9
"
                SAO is a pretty good anime. I'm not an expert by any means, and this might be one of the most polarizing anime ever, but it's really enjoyable if you know what you're getting into. If you're expecting a really deep plot, with great character development, deep characters and all the other things that make for a great story, you should probably avoid SAO. If you are interested in the premise of the anime, enjoy harem anime (yeah, it turns into one pretty quick), a decent love story, fun characters that you end up caring about (even though they ain't particularly deep, as I said
                  before) all while enjoying a great soundtrack and amazing animations, you're gonna love SAO. Just be aware that it's supposed to be a casual anime, that you can enjoy without thinking too much. If that's not the sort of thing you like, there's other options for you. Warning: the second half of the season is not quite as good as the first. I enjoyed it still personally, but that doesn't seem to be the consensus (and it IS true that the story goes off the deep end in the second half), so be aware of that.",8
"
                The story revolves around Kirito, our protagonist who is powerful, strong willed, humble, and at times stubborn. He and 10,000 other players enter into a virtual MMORPG where they soon find out about a fatal intentional game flaw: you can't log out. To escape the game, Kirito and other players must band together to defeat all 100 floors of the world. If they can't, they are doomed to remain in the game where death in-game means death in the real world.
The series itself is divided into two separate arcs: the Aincrad Arc and the Fairy Dance Arc. But, I won't go into detail other than
                  the two arcs hold slightly different objectives.
Anyhow, Kirito travels throughout the world where he meets noobs and experienced players along the way. Each character shown in the first arc in my opinion was great. I loved meeting each person and wish I could have seen more of certain people. The interactions between characters can be both hilarious and even heart-breaking at times. 
For those of you interested as to whether or not the anime can relate to an actual MMORPG, the answer is yes. It definitely uses jargon such as: duels, guilds, switching, trading, etc. There is also a supposed auction house and most definitely an economy. Also, the boss fights which happen are pure epic. It was never dull watching the players collaborate together to try to defeat the bosses shown. Not to mention the holy music that plays during fight scenes, I really enjoyed and appreciate that. I'm sure other anime fans who love not only the animation and story, but also score and sound effects, will appreciate the audio too. 
For those wondering what elements this anime has, it definitely relates to video games, but that's not it. It has fantasy, sci-fi, action, adventure, and yes romance (more than I thought it would have, honestly lol) elements. If any of these elements seem appealing, then check it out. 
One last thing people might be considering is whether or not this is a good anime for beginners to watch. It's a good question, and one that many anime fans ponder when they want to introduce a friend to anime in general. My final answer is yes, it's a good show to introduce to a friend who watches very little or no anime at all, as long as that friend is into MMORPGs. Because the anime is about a subject they can relate to, they're going to enjoy it more. Obviously, if the friend is only into shooters, that person may not like it. However, there is one fatal flaw in introducing this series to a friend though: this show in particular is either a hit or a really big miss. The main reason is most likely because of the romance element. The viewer may either continue to watch it because they like the pairing, or they will hate it because it has some romance and its awkward to watch. This is especially true for people who have not watched any anime at all. Other than that, if you're willing to take a risk and introduce it to a friend then go for it. 
Overall, I give this series a 8/10.",8

                Sword Art Online is a disappointing anime; a pony among a herd of horses, if you will. There’s so much right with it, yet so much wrong at the same time. A lot of people don’t like this show, but I think they dislike it for the wrong reasons. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot to dislike here, but people tend to focus on aspects of the show that aren’t actually all too bad, just because they’re on the surface - instead, the underlying issues tear at the viewer without them even realizing.
First off, the MC. A lot of people seem to hate Kirito
                  for some reason; I think a lot of people see an isekai protagonist and just assume they’re gonna be overpowered, but that’s not the case here. I actually don’t mind Kirito at all - I think he has a compelling backstory that makes him a suitable MC for the occasion, and compared to most MC’s he’s actually quite unique. He has reasons for his power, but the problem becomes that those reasons stop being good enough. Sure he’s a beta tester, but how the hell does he get his dual wielding thing? And furthermore, how come we never see any other beta testers. You’d think that if being an early access player would give Kirito such an advantage, surely his fellow beta testers would also have that same advantage. Him being practically unkillable makes the premise that if you die in the game you die in real life nonexistent, and so Kirito just isn’t the right fit for the show.
Speaking of which, we rarely ever see any major characters die. The concept of the show is actually really good, contrary to popular belief, but without constantly fearing that death it doesn’t really do anything for the viewer. If there are any character deaths at all, it instead falls on background characters or characters we the audience were just introduced to. By the end of the first cour, the entire fear of death thing is completely gone, and doesn’t return in any form until the much better 2nd season.
The plot in general is just a mess. Nothing interesting happens after the first few episodes, and the supporting cast is weak with one exception, which I’ll get to. People who like SAO just like it for the cool concept, but it just isn’t executed well at all.
The one good aspect of SAO is certainly Asuna. I like that the show makes Asuna more skilled than Kirito, a trait we don’t get to see used very often but is appreciated nonetheless. Kirito being as strong as he is leads to him feeling very disconnected, but Asuna constantly has to work for her strength. Unfortunately, her character is replaced with [i refuse to say her name, its kiritos cousin], a much worse female supporting character and the entire show falls apart alongside her introduction.
If you have to watch SAO, I advise you skip the 2nd half and go straight to SAOII, which is a much, much better show. Would not recommend this first season aside from as context for that 2nd season.",4
"
                Sword Art Online was a pleasant ride for me. Adding spice to my weekend. Light novel adaptation has always result in great anime production simply because of the already interesting story. But in the case of SAO, it is a masterpiece. I came into the first episode with no prior knowledge of the story and it blew me away. As a fan of rpg, a part of me wish that such virtual world can exist. I'm sure many people will agree with me. I believe the story and the character were the defining factor for making this series an anime to remembered.
Story (10):
Speechlessly good. The
                  progress was well paced. Watching someone play video games has always been a boring affair for me but watching an anime about a video game in this case was surprisingly fun. The twist were well presented. I was caught off guard when the boss in Aingard was revealed and when a new game emerged just as the previous one ended. It was all well weaved together and i definitely enjoyed the quality of the plot.
Character (10):
Another important factor for this anime's success is the characters. Our main character is just an ordinary guy who loves playing game. But as the story progress, we realised that gaming was just a method for him to hide from reality. Despite falling into a trap set by the game producer, he survived and even made friends and found love. By the end of the 2 years stint in aingrad, he even matured as a man and as a brother. The short series explored each characters deeply and it was not sacrificed for the fanciful boss fights or elaborated adventures. Overall, i understood and enjoyed each character presented by the series.
Overall (10):
All in all,  a great series, one which reminds me of the greed island arc of Hunter x Hunter, my favourite anime of all time. A story-driven action anime with meaningful message always touches my heart and i strongly believe it will stay up there as a top anime for years to come.",10
"
                Sword Art Online was a anime that had a lot of high hopes for it. Finally finishing the anime i can say that it lived up to its name.
The anime produced a lot of good episodes by the 2nd episode i was hooked. If you like action/romance then this is for you. It has a lot of fight scenes some done well. But the best part for me was the relationship between the main characters. It had me hooked wanting more. It started to drag out a bit at the end and the ending episode wasent the best but you can tell they were building
                  it up for another season (Yes SO PUMPED!!)
Overall its a good anime in that genre definitely worth the watch 9/10",9

                In fiction, a story like this would normally last about a month their time—long enough for the players to become inseparable friends, but not long enough to change who they are at their core. Twelve episodes in and more than two years have already passed since the start—two years spent living in a VR world. This allows for an in-depth look at the psychological implications of being in a virtual reality for so long that you start to wonder if the real world even exists. And if it does exist, should everyone still be trying to get back to it instead of giving up and
                  starting to make new lives for themselves inside the game world.
The Implications of Creating a Society in a Virtual World:
But beyond discussions of reality, Sword Art Online also delves into the sociological issues of living in this virtual world. Some people trapped in the game are hardcore gamers while other casual players or young children—don't have the experience or skills to be risking their lives in the still unbeaten dungeons. So do you, as a hardcore gamer, draft the whole lot and make them fight? Do you just leave them—including the children—to fend for themselves? As a non-fighter, can you really spend all your time leveling up a trade skill—trusting the hardcore gamers to get you back to reality? And with a return to the real world always there to motivate you, can you justify slacking off, falling in love, or training in the cooking skill? All these questions and more are addressed over the course of the story.
A Genre-Crossing Story:
Because everyone is trapped inside the game, their knowledge of the virtual world is limited to what they learn in the game itself. So while everyone knows the basic rules of the world, no one knows the specifics other than the data collected in the beta test. This makes the world perfect for adventures from a wide range of genres. Sometimes it's a mystery; sometimes it's a love story; sometimes criminal suspense; sometimes supernatural horror; and sometimes it's a straight-up fantasy adventure.
Hooking Up Isn't the End of the Love Story
If there's one overused cliché in anime, it's that once two characters hook up, it's the end of the story—like the relationship after that point is a given. Thankfully, Sword Art does not stick to the norm. Thus the plot explores a love story in Sword Art's unique setting and brings definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world.
Predictably Tragic:
If there is one problem with Sword Art Online, it's that it is overly tragic. No matter the situation, you are pretty much guaranteed the most tragic resolution possible (that leaves the main character alive). Even the most triumphant and uplifting moments are clouded by some major tragedy—usually involving the deaths of player characters. Because of this, the series becomes somewhat predictable since any happy endings are, by and large, off the table.
Final Thoughts:
Sword Art Online is a fantastic anime series so far. While not the first anime to have the ""trapped in an MMORPG"" setting (see .hack//sign), it is certainly the deepest when it comes to the psychology and sociology behind it.",9
"
                Is this review waaaaaay to late and kind of outdated? Yes. Do i want to justify why this anime wasnt the BEST THING EVER? Absolutely. Sword Art Online was the most popular anime of 2012. Right now, in 2013, we've got Attack on Titan, but for know, lets take a look at Sword Art Online.
Plot: 
To be honest, SAO's premise shows infinite potential. A ton of people who are trapped in a MMORPG that they have to beat to get out ? And when they die ingame, they die in real life as well? Thats just awesome, plotwise THAT is Sword Art Onlines greatest strength
                  next to is production value. And during the beginning, it looked sooo damn promising ( until ep 4-5 ). The story got sidetracked alot after that. From trying to develop 2 romances in 2 episodes to an episode where the main characters just fuck around. And I just want to ask: Why? This game has 100 floors to beat => 100 bosses to beat, and we only get to see 4 or 5 boss battles. The infinite potential was wasted. And dont even get me started on the 2nd half .... GOD. its not that I hated it, but I think the story went a bit out of hand. Stopping a pedophile from marrying a teenage girl in a coma isnt what I originally expected, but that whole sister ( oh wait, it's the cousin 0_o ) relationship thing just fuuuucked stuff up. Anyways, I still think that the way SAO's story was set up is great, and with more episodes it could've destroyed. But while looking at the way it is, it bumped down to an okay story
Characters:
The MC, Kirito, is the god damn MLG ProGamerGod of all awesome. He just destroys everything. My problem is, that he didnt develop in any way. I mean yeah, that Sachi thing was sad, and you could see its effects, but they didnt take any further than that and some similiar things. And the romances that are portrayed in this anime were ... uhh.... a bit underdeveloped. Asuna, who is the female MC, starts off as a mysterious badass chick who works her way up to the top. But in the end she turned out to be a tsundere ... man. She can still kick some ass though, I would've liked it if the romance between her and Kirito would've been more developed. Because the way it was done just didnt satisfy in any way. it one of those: I like you because you're the male MC of this anime thing. There are several side characters as well and some of them were actually quite cool. As for the villains.... lets say the first one was good. The only thing that bugged me about him is that we still dont know why the hell he created a game in which he trapped tons of people who he forced to fight for their lives. Other than that I actaully liked him. The 2nd villain .... a pedophile who wants to marry ( and in ep 24 i think rapes ) a girl who is in a coma and trapped in a game. Meh, he looked absolutely laughable as well. I would say that THIS is SAO's weakest overall point. But now, we've got the negative stuff out of the way and i can start to explain you the good stuff.
Presentation:
Great, absolutely great. The animation and the art style are fucking good. The battles are just a feast to the eyes and the backgrounds are vibrant and detailed. The music is epic and makes certain scenes just so much better and did i already mention THAT THE BOSS BATTLES ARE AWESOME 0_o. Sword Art Online has outstanding production value, which is one of its most positive aspects.
Enjoyment:
I sounded kinda negative during the review didnt I? Well, I still enjoyed SAO for what it was. It showed an interesting world with pretty generic characters. I liked the portrayal of the different aspects of the game and the fighting scenes were just amazing. During my first watch I simply ignored many problems. But after starting a 2nd watch I realized that is was very flawed. Its still a pretty damn enjoyable show.
Overall:
It's kind of disappointing to see so much potential to be wasted, but i think SAO was a good anime. Its saving grace were its look and its sound which, in combination, resulted in some pretty intense scenes. I would've loved to give this anime an 8. Because, believe it or not, presentation can bump up an animes score quite a lot for me. But when the rest is so flawed, I can only give it an overall 7 at best, which I give SAO.

                Moderator edit: This review contains spoilers
Lets start off with my opinion on sword art online.
Here's what I think about it-
T-R-A-S-H . The first 12 or so episodes were good after that- its unbearable to watch. 
Sword art online follows the story of a young boy named Kazuto kirigaya who has been trapped in a virtual reality online game known as sword art online or SAO. After escaping sword art online, defeating the creator of SAO and obtaining the ""seed"" which connects all the VR (virtual reality) games together, he finds out that his ""girlfriend "" ASUNA is still in a coma from being trapped in
                  SAO for some years. He later finds out about where she is located- which brings us to-
ALFEIM ONLINE. He saves asuna blah blah asuna gets harassed by the person she was forced to marry blah blah THENNNN
A YEAR OR SOMETHING Later- there's someone who's killing people in real life by killing them in game :O which brings us to- 
GUN GALE ONLINE!! :D 
I dropped this anime for here on cause I just couldn't bear to watch this.
This is an honest review about Sao where I point it's flaws (basically the whole show) and try to explain what makes it a flaw. Also SAO is a harem- that should explain it.",3
"
                I really loved Sword Art Online! This was also the first anime I have watched!
I found the storyline interesting and how they used cable links to play in a video game world, instead of that being their actual life they live in, I found that creative and haven't seen any other anime like that.
I think the art was pretty good, but I think it could've been a tad more detailed to me personally, I don't know, something seemed kind of weird about it to me.
I liked how it was focused on action, and how there was many battles throughout the anime, and the fact that
                  the action scenes didn't last like 10 seconds compared to some other animes made it more enjoyable.
Although it's more focused on action I still really enjoyed the few romance scenes included in it and like the relationship with Kirito and Asuna.
Also, I think maybe 1 or 2 characters were kind of annoying at some points of the anime, it really started to bug me after a while.
This is definitely one of the best animes I've ever watched so far!",10
"
                This anime tends to get some mixed reviews, so I will do my best to offer a clarifying opinion. ***Warning: potential spoilers ahead (if you have not seen the anime!)***
I've seen both Sword Art Online (SOA) season 1 and season 2. If you've read reviews praising SOA, they're most likely praising part one of season one. If you've read reviews trashing SOA, they're most likely trashing everything else. I find both viewpoints to be a bit extreme. Although the critiques you will read about are legitimate, all things considered, SOA is a great anime. 
What's good: The story centers around a concept that I--and I'm
                  sure many others--have entertained since I was a kid. Virtual reality, and the idea of entering a video game where you maintain your bodily form is nothing short of awesome. Sure, the concept itself may not be novel. But where SOA really shines is its execution in bringing the concept of virtual reality to life. The anime does an excellent job of presenting watchers with a hypothetical thought experiment of what it would be like to be trapped in a virtual world for two years. Unlike other animes, SOA is set up such that you don't feel like you need to suspend your disbelief too much. With advances in AI, machine learning, and user experience, we could very well one day live in a world where entering an SAO realm would be possible. 
With an awesome concept serving as the background for the story, the actual plot was very entertaining. I grew up with Saturday morning cartoons like Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, Teen Titans, etc. and one of the most recurring plots was always some rendition of ""saving the world."" Here, SAO offers a twist on that age old plot cliche: escape the world. But to do that, the protagonists of the story are forced to fight through dungeons and bosses to reach the end of a world level before moving on. In the first half of season one, the story advances rather quickly--some might argue too quickly--which leads to serious pros and cons about the writing for the rest of the season. More on that in a bit. As the plot begins to build build, it eventually leads to one of the most memorable plot twists from an anime that I've seen to date. Overall, if only for the story alone, SAO is worth the watch. It is a thoroughly entertaining action anime that will leave you wanting more.
This anime also has an abundance of scenes depicting landscapes and other areas that are artistically gorgeous. Honestly, when I finished watching the anime, part of me longed to live somewhere akin to Aincrad. I think when an anime is visually and aesthetically appealing, it is a reflection of how the writers/producers/people that make this stuff view their own work. When the artwork is great, when they invest the time and resources into hiring animators to make each individual scene look good, I think it signals to the watcher that this isn't just any ordinary anime. This is something that is actually worth watching through to the end.
Hands down, one of the best features of SAO is the music. I'm an avid OST listener, and if you're a fan of scores from video games, movies, and anime, then you will love some of the OSTs from SAO. I maintain a playlist of songs from various anime that I have seen over the years, and SAO ranks as one of the top most animes with OSTs that I listen to on a regular basis. Even if you never watch the anime itself, go listen to the music. But don't take my word for it. Go on Youtube and look up a few OSTs from SAO. When you find one, any one, just hike up the volume, sit back, relax, and enjoy.
At this point, I've tried to portray some of the aspects that I liked best about SAO in the most positive light possible. As I mentioned at the start of my review you will either read reviews that absolutely love SAO or hate it. Let me now discuss why some people might hate it. 
What's bad: First off, let's start with one of the more milder complaints: character development. For the most part, SAO's character development is something you might expect from a typical anime. You have the hero, Kirito, and his love interest, Asuna, and a villain who is, arguably, the most sophisticated character of all but has the least amount of screen time. This is frustrating because it feels as if the writers invested all of their efforts in making the anime look and sound good without investing much in the area of developing the character's personalities. In the first half of season one, the lack of character development isn't entirely apparent. Initially, everyone's motivation seems pretty clear--escape the video game and get back to the real world. Although Kirito first comes across as this douche that thinks he's better than everyone, that perception is quickly curtailed when the writers, through the use of a convenient plot device that sees his party members die as a result of a trap that he led them into, pull a complete 180 and rewrite Kirito as this altruistic savior that suddenly seems to care about the wellbeing of everyone else. On the other hand, Asuna maintains a very edgy personality for a majority of the first half of the anime--something that is quite refreshing given the abundance of animes that depict women as these damsels in distress--until the inevitable romance occurs between Kirito and Asuna. The love story is kind of cute, and the chemistry between the characters is real. However, when the story progresses beyond the first half of the season, all caution is thrown to the wind and the writing takes one of the longest falls down the shitter I have ever seen. 
When part two of season one begins, the flaws in the character development really become apparent and you begin to realize that the makers of SAO really spent little to no time distinguishing this story from any other anime with similar characters. At the conclusion of the Aincrad arc, Kirito and everyone trapped in the virtual world are returned to real life, except for Asuna. Part two commences with Kirito voluntarily reentering another virtual world in an attempt to bring Asuna back to reality. My biggest problem with this new arc is that the writers seem to assume that Kirito's accomplishments and victory in the previous arc were enough of a justification to warrant every decision that Kirito makes in part two. When Kirito embarks on his quest to rescue Asuna, his quest quickly turns into a mission to save the new video game world from the evils of the fairy king. In this regard, SAO turns into just another ""save the world"" type anime. Moreover, in part two, Asuna becomes the archetypical damsel in distress while Kirito has no real reason to be doing anything else but rescuing her and gtfoing. Real original, right? But it gets better. As in any cliche anime with a romance story, Kirito somehow becomes the most heterosexual male that every female in the story fawns over and quickly forms his own harem. When Asuna is saved and season one ends, Asuna assumes her place as Kirito's bitch and is basically emasculated of all her fiery passion and edginess that she exemplified in the first half of season one.
If that's not shitty character development, then I don't know what is. But that's not even the worst part about SAO. Sadly, at the conclusion of season one, it becomes clear that the writers really had no reason to give a shit in season two and so you are led on with one of the biggest teases in anime history. Season two starts with an awesome premise and an awesome plot idea, but is quickly ended in a matter of a few episodes with one of the most underwhelming conclusions to date. As you are left wondering what will follow the conclusion of the first arc of season two, you imagine all the possible plots that could follow. ""Maybe the writers of SAO won't pull a season one!"", you think to yourself. ""Maybe it'll be better!"", you say. But sadly and cruelly, despite all of your hopes and dreams, your expectations are proved horribly wrong, and season two concludes with one of the shittiest endings to an anime ever. With no rhyme or reason, the first arc in SAO season two is rushed to a conclusion that is far from satisfying and leaves you wondering, what was the point?
So there you have it. Despite the shortcomings following part one of season one, I still thoroughly enjoyed this anime and refuse to give it less than an 8. Many will disagree with my opinion here, and that's fine. I probably shouldn't be so generous. But if I pretend that the stuff after season one never happened, this anime actually was really good. Also, for those of you that noticed that my writing became progressively worse as I went on, that was intentional. It was intended to reflect how the writing in SAO became progressively shittier as time went on. So if you started my review thinking that I was providing some excellent feedback, but then ended it thinking that I wrote like a kindergardener, that's precisely how I felt after watching SAO. Good day.",8
"
                No, I am not a FANBOY of SAO, neither do I HATE it to death because it is full of tropes and makes Kirito out to look like god amongst men.
I enjoyed it, kinda. At least the idea of it. The first episode was well made, too well. It brought everybody into it's lush world, introducing all the possibilities. It looked like an anime about video games that didn't suck and it didn't, at least for the first half when it mostly did what was expected from it.
The second half on the other hand was a big downfall. It literally copied the first half without
                  remorse, doing the exact same things without nothing new and unexpected. It just brought in more fetishes and fanservice witch is why most of the people probably got turned off from the series.
The thing with the first season is that it left me with very mixed feelings since it was good, it did something incredible and brought a really good VR game anime to the world while messing it up in the second half.
You can see my whole review about it here where i systematically pick it apart: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6Ioci-7XI
Much love appreciated <3",8
"
                I kept weighing up whether I should watch Sword Art Online for a few months, and it wasn't until a friend coaxed me into it that I watched it. And I was not in the least regretful of that. I truly enjoyed this series and would highly recommend it, and despite the large amount of conflicting opinions, it does hold it's ground.
Story: 8
The premise is one of the main drawing cards of SAO and I think most people will agree that it at least lived up to expectations in that respect. The concept of around 10,000 players being trapped within a MMO where in-game death
                  means real life death is not entirely brand new, but the way it is portrayed is very well done. Guilds, Bosses, Grinding  and pretty much everything you'd expect from a MMO is all there and it is implemented realistically into the game. However, though the setting is done really well, one thing that is done pretty badly is the pacing.
 The jump from episode 1 to episode 2 is one month and it's pretty off-putting, especially so early in the series. This would be ok, if it didn't feel like you were missing some important plot points or if it didn't happen so frequently. You can really feel this in the first few episodes and when it's coming up to the end of the first season. An example of this is Kirito and Asuna's friendship and how it feels really disjointed. One episode they don't like each other that much and the next they treat each other like friends, and though it feels like they practically had no time in between, they would have actually had a month or so that the writers didn't show you. It's not detrimental, but it does make the show feel very disjointed and like you are missing out on a lot of potential. 
Characters: 5
The main two characters in SAO are Kirito and Asuna and there is certainly no doubt about that. And while they are certainly likeable, they are the stereotypical perfection characters that really don't have any in-character personality flaws. This really doesn't matter to me, as I still love the characters and that's what counts in my mind, but I definitely know that lots of other people would not like that. Kirito is a guy who works hard to keep up a tough persona to the community as a whole, while opening up to people he actually talks to and Asuna is a girl who keeps up a tough persona to distract her from the situation. The two characters grow in their personalities slightly, but generally stay the same throughout the two seasons.
 Half of the focus of Season 1 and Season 2 is the relationship between these two, and I must say that I think it was done pretty well, excluding the time gaps. If you assume that lots of development happened in gaps, the relationship is actually pretty believable. I also liked how they kept their relationship rationally appropriate instead of going on a fanservicy route for no reason. 
There is however a detracting point in the inclusion of most supporting characters. Without going in-depth about them here, the characters are all pretty likeable. Despite that, the two main characters are Asuna and Kirito and every other character barely sees the light of day as a result of that. There are some great potential people who would have made the story more enjoyable that had a whole episode based around them, but that was it. For characters like Lizbeth and Silica, they spend an episode with them as the central focus, and then they never appear again until the end of each season. Even then, it's just a cameo appearance really, with maybe one line. There were some characters who had a tad more prominence like Klein and Agil, but they still only had a few appearances. What made it feel even more like the potential of these characters were wasted, was how the show treated them like they had been main characters for the whole thing, whenever they appeared. This also is also attributed to the pacing, as you missed any extra interactions that occurred in those gaps.
Sound/Art: 9/8
The art is very beautiful and suits the setting really well, but it's nothing utterly amazing that you would write to home about. The animations for stuff like players dying and items expiring is pretty, but other than that it's just plain good. Nothing extraordinary, but still very nice. 
As for the sound, SAO has a nice OST, but once again nothing out of the ordinary. I loved LiSA's performance with Crossing Field the best, but Innocence and Overfly are really great songs as well. The voices are well suited toward the characters, and gives a very clear representation of personality even if the character isn't developed, such as Klein. 
I've stated a lot of flaws and stuff, and though it may seem that I don't see this show in a positive light, I really did love it. I didn't mention a lot of the good points and avoided talking about Season 2 that much, as it's just something you have to watch, instead of getting spoiled with anything. The plot isn't anything explosively superlative, however I really enjoyed it and would really like the other Light Novels to get adapted as well. 
All in all, I'd say that SAO is something that even if you don't think you would enjoy it due to it's flaws and the hate that it gets, you can enjoy it a lot if you can look past those things. I'd encourage everyone to try it at least, even if you don't enjoy it. 
(Sorry about the bad reviewing skills. I just felt that I should put my two cents worth out there. Also, my score is really based on enjoyment rather than the technical side of things, in case you were wondering)",8

                I'm not going to give a 5 page analysis on Sword Art Online, but I do want to share my thoughts on the anime.
S.A.O to me is an anime that revitalizes a genre, especially since the cyber genre (excluding Accel World) has been more gritty and overly-violent as of lately, this anime was a nice change of pace. However, this is not to say Sword Art Online does not have its flaws, because it does, in major ways.
Story: S.A.O. takes a few elements from other series but adds its own unique flavor to it. However the flavor of the anime turns somewhat bitter during the
                  second arc (ALFHeim online). Kirito, our main protagonist (to me) is a breath of fresh air, simply because he starts off as a powerful character. Personally, when I am watching action anime, I divide the characters up into 2 categories: ""Talent vs Fighting Will"". Talent being that the character either is already somewhat powerful and/or skilled (Ed from F.M.A, Natsu from Fairy Tail) or comes into being powerful early OR accepting his responsibility on in the series (Ichigo from BLEACH). ""Fighting Will"" being the opposite which is ""getting the crap kicked out of you until your comrade dies or you have a 2-3 episode flash back and magically gaining the power to defeat your enemy"" (e.g. Naruto, Luffy, and pretty much 90% of other action anime)
Not to digress, coming back to my point that early on in S.A.O. you see Kirito being the badass, which reading some of the other reviews, people might not necessarily like. Kirito (in episode 2 and later episode 5) is joined by his love interest Asuna, who despite trying to make a female lead, ends up being another cliche damsel in distress. Which irritates me a bit, considering that they reference her as ""faster than Kirito"" and vice commander of the lead group. 
Where the story falls short in my opinion is during transitional episodes. It jumps around a bit, which isn't necessarily confusing but, it lacks substance. The characters just easily accept something (like Kirito's and Asuna's ""daughter""). If I were to divide the entire series into 4 parts, part 1, 2, 4 rock! and part 3 is just terrible, with fan service and adding love interests, that just cheapen the show.
Art: Amazing 
Sound: The classical music really adds to the fight scenes
Characters: Could have been more developed; especially Kirito
Enjoyment: Excluding ""Part 3"" I really enjoyed the series",9
"
                OK, to start with, I honestly enjoyed this anime a lot, and don't know why it received so many negative reviews, so I thought I would put my 2 cents here...
The first thing I noticed about SOA is its beautiful arts. I have never seen an anime with such taken-care-of arts. Following Kirito, you will explore the Aincrad world, from cozy hotel rooms to busy streets to peaceful flower gardens to menacing dark dungeons. It is easy to immerse into the SOA world once you have watched it. The character design unfortunately isn't so great, but still amazingly done. As an example: Silica, a character
                  appeared in only one episode, had 3 or 4 different outfits, and they are all gorgeous!
Next comes the story and story telling style, which is probably the most controversal aspect of SOA. SOA adopted a very peculiar story telling strategy: during the first half, we often see Kirito with a / a group of other characters, and after 1 or 2 episodes, these people disappear and never seen again (until the end of the anime). My guess is that this irritates lot of viewers, since it is just... unusual. However, I really like this kind of ""development"". The point is, after an episode or two, I got to understand the character very well - the anime did a good job in elaborating the character's personalities - and so there's not much point dragging them into later episodes. Besides, it's like ""short stories"": watching SOA is like watching a collection of short stories. And each of them is actually pretty good, if you don't mind taking them as short stories.
I also really liked the development between Asuna & Kirito (even thought individually they didn't have much development). They ran into each other here and there by chance, and sort of liked each other, but their love truly blossomed only when the real hardship comes. It is really a beautiful love story. On a side note, Kirito wasn't, like the lead male character in many other anime, a fool that ignores other girls' feelings for him and letting them hanging around. He was pretty straight in his attitude, and loyal toward Asuna. 
SOA doesn't have much fighting scenes (as opposed to its name) and some are deliberately shortened, or even cut off entirely. I think the intention here is to emphasize on character's development, espcially Kirito, and I think that is a good and a novel point, which gave the anime much more depth and meaning. Having said that, fighting scenes in SOA are purely a-w-e-s-o-m-e, short and sparingly, but awesome (music is a great factor here, whenever I hear that soundtrack, my heart beats faster, and I know some awesome actions are coming! I don't care much about sounds, so no comment on the rest of the sounds).
Actually everything I said above was about ""the first half"" , since this is where SOA shines the most. The second half is, hmmm, somewhat redundant, and I think most people agree with this. Not much to say here. Maybe the anime would be more perfect if it has finished at episode 13.
Overally I really really enjoyed the anime. However we are all different (and that's what makes our world amazing), so I don't expect everyone to enjoy it, but I definitely recommend it to YOU who are reading this. If you like it, well, congrats! Otherwise, it is just not for you :D. Thanks for reading!",10
"
                This anime, was good, well at least the first half of it was, and I really wish that this anime was divided into seasons based on the arc like Sailor Moon was so I could review the arcs separately. But here is my review of Sword Art Online.
The bad. The whole of the second arc was pretty bad, there were certain things that I questioned about second arc that made me kind of annoyed. For instance, people don't go to the lengths that Sugou did just to piss off Asuna. When I say people don't do this, I mean that people don't really force others
                  into marrying them, they don't do it at all because it is actually illegal to do, yes, arranged marriage is illegal if the groom or bride doesn't want to marry the other person or is highly opposed to the idea, it's kind of a thing. And it doesn't seem like the loving father, that Asuna was bragging about, to marry his daughter off while she is in a coma. So having an unrealistic villain because the last villain wasn't really a villain and you needed to have a person that people could hate as the main villain, really seems like a cop out and really lowers the score on this for story, character and my overall enjoyment of the series. The other thing that pisses me off about this series is not Sugu believe it or not, but the ending, which seems to be universally loved. The ending made absolutely no sense to me, why would these people go back to playing MMORPGs with anything that resembles nerve gear after experiencing what happened in Sword Art Online. Any person with any sense wouldn't ever put a nerve gear on in the first place let alone use it after a traumatic experience involving it. Another thing I need to point out is all the plot holes in this part. For instance, where is Kirito's mom all the time. They outright state that she lives with them at the beginning of this arc and then they just disregard that and make her unpresent all of the time. Another thing, the reasoning for why Asuna and lots of others were transfered to Alfhiem Online was kind of bullshit. It would have taken them at least a few days to get the rights to the program used to make Sword Art Online, by that point, every single player would have been logged off and with their families again. So that's a massive gaping plot hole. How about less likable characters within the game, turning Yui into a pixie like thing, and just having this part so that you can charge more for a boxset. Another thing I was kind of annoyed with was the fact that Asuna and Kirito didn't realize that they can't actually raise Yui, the main reason for this is something similar to Chobits, which handled this much better, saying that no matter how much it seems like it, an AI can't love you back, it's only programmed to do so. That's also a good lesson for anybody who wants to marry a fiction character, they can't love you, even if they are programmed, it's just a lie created by either you or somebody else.
The good. The first arc was amazing. You have likable characters that evolve over time and real life conflict rather than just ""Some old creep used bullshit logic to get my girlfriend stuck in a video game again"". People reacted to this whole thing more realistically and even started to scapegoat people because they had played through parts of the game before and didn't say anything about the dungeons, where as in the next season it was literally just a game, that played more like a society, this was a society of people stuck inside of a game. I didn't expect most of the events that happened and it wasn't the most predictable show at this point, I was happy when they had Asuna and Kirito get together in the series and actually had their relationship develop. And the ending to this arc was just amazing, this was the ending that they should have gone with. The villain not really being evil and even forgetting why he did what he did by the end of the two years that this took place over. And I did like the Sugu side story in the second half, it was the only good part of that side story.
Final Verdict:
Watch the first half and look up a summary of the second if you are curious what happens.

                The artwork was really good, I also loved the soundtrack. The boring plot, tentacle raped lolis, cliche characters, predictable events, cringeworthy cabins, rape scenes, and it's forced, unnecessary second half ruined it. I overall really liked the show at first, it just slowly got worse and worse. By the time I was half way through ""Elf-shit Online"" I just wanted to kill myself. The first season wasn't absolutely unwatchable. Just for the love of all that is good in this world:  don't. Watch. Season. 2.

                I absolutely love Sword Art Online! It's such an amazing anime and you can get really easily attached to the characters which I LOVE! If you want an anime you can cry at almost every single episode, this is the perfect anime. It's filled with so many feelings and it's just, a work of art, honestly. The anime will make you cry, I promise. I cried every single episode for the first 7 episodes and I ugly-cried at episode 3. It's just so good am I'm so glad I decided to watch it. I definitely recommend you give SAO a watch!

                By no means a great anime, SAO epitomises the shonen genre, complete with symptomatic shortages: a story that doesn't really take off, let alone do justice to its premise; art of uneven quality (a few great backgrounds, decent characters, an almost editorial contempt for creature design and execution) and a competent, yet forgettable soundtrack.
In the meantime it succeeds at developing a mainstream experience, sacrificing to the conventions of the genre without altogether turning into a bland, distasteful mess. So I'm happy to say that I waited for (almost) each episode with some anticipation, and enjoyed them (almost) to the last.
By mainstream, I mean that, it
                  doesn't draw on anything extreme. For example it is neither gore nor ecchi, nor outrageously caricatural in any way. So, while this piece doesn't amaze, I have to say that it's pretty difficult to work with the mass of cliches that lie at the core of this thing, and get something good out of it. The downside is that the result strikes me as somewhat immature; the good side, however, is that had I kids I'd rather have them watch SAO than... the hell-of-a-lot-of-other-stuff.",7
"
                The first time I watched Sword Art Online, I fairly enjoyed it. I was really invested in it and I absolutely adored everything about it. The execution, the story, the characters, I had thought it was all amazing.
Coming back to it again after a few years, I can honestly say that looking past all of its layers from an objective standpoint, it's a sub par joke of an anime more comparable to a 13-year-old's power fantasy, than an actual attempt at a competent and compelling story.
Background:
It's not even like saying it was rushed is false. SAO was originally a submission for a writing competition after
                  all, and the creator himself has stated how he had rushed the creative process just to submit it in time. Despite this though the story was too long to qualify and was thus never submitted. Reki Kawahara continued the series as a web novel before being asked to Publish SAO later on.
I had watched Sword Art Online 2 years ago, in the March of 2015.
I was relatively new to Anime at the time, having only seen two Anime previously (Notably Naruto and Dragon Ball Z) but I had heard of the series' popularity and thus I decided to give it a shot. 
I was captured by the Characters, by Kirito, Asuna, and their various interactions throughout the story. I thought the concept of the game was inventive and something new. I fell in love with it.
As time went on, I started exposing myself to more and more anime. I had also heard of the strong Negative voices against Sword Art Online, but I dismissed them since I had personally thought that it was a decent Anime.
But I came back to it recently, watching it again, and this time...seeing all the flaws that everyone else had seen in it.
I write this review as someone who had once seen this series before and loved it, but I've come to understand all the negatives and cons of Sword Art Online and have come to give my opinion on it once again.
Story:
I don't really believe I need to explain this much as the basic premise of SAO is already written in the Anime's Synopsis above.
I will say though that not only is Sword Art Online's Plot and Story terrible, but the game itself is terrible in theory.
All throughout the Anime, as we see Asuna and Kirito progress through the game we're introduced to Game Concepts that are only there to either...
A) Act as a plot Device, helping pull SAO's already terrible story forward along.
B) To impress the viewers with how seemingly amazing and complex the game and world of Aincrad is.
Kirito throughout the story is constantly boosted to ridiculously powerful proportions compared to everyone else in the game, the only reason for such power being that ""He played the game for a few weeks before"" or ""He tries harder than anyone else"" which is just plain dumb given how many people play the game. Does he manage to complete seemingly impossible feats given the guidelines of the game simply because he has the motivation? 
It's honestly the dumbest excuse for overpowering a character I've ever seen.
Side characters and hell, even Main characters' personalities seem like one-dimensional plastic, feigning depth character-wise. You can always predict what the character will do or think. There is absolutely little to no development of any characters throughout the course of the story. Any attempt at character development is mind-numbingly fake it's a wonder how anyone believes it for genuine story telling.
The pacing of the story is utter garbage. Within the first few episodes, the anime had already managed to surprise me. I genuinely thought that I had skipped an episode when it turned out that it was the actual content of the next episode. So many opportunities could have been had to flesh out the world of Aincrad and her inhabitants, but none of them were taken.
Each episode is seemingly a filler showing the various levels of the game without showing how they got there, just the end result. The Adventure without the journey is terrible, that's all there is to it.
Not to mention the incredibly dumb decision the Anime took about halfway through (I'm not spoiling, but you'll see it for yourself if you watch it)
It completely ruined anything the Story had going for it in the first few episodes.
Art:
The Art of Sword Art Online isn't anything special. It isn't very bad in any sort of the word, but it isn't very good either. It's just okay. It has the samey kind of Art that A1 Studios Anime are known for. It exercises some bright colors at times and some of the backgrounds could even be called stunning or even beautiful, but its use of CGI in some scenes is god-awful and probably unnecessary.
The character designs seem pretty generic for anyone that isn't Kirito or Asuna, looking like generic Fantasy world trash, no creativity involved for several player designs.
Sound:
The sound is, I believe SAO's one redeeming quality.
The Soundtrack for Sword Art Online is amazing.
Tracks are atmospheric, emotional, and heart-warming.
Yuki Kajiura's work here is impressive, there's no denying it, her work is spectacular, and it definitely pulls up SAO's grade for me, but the Music can only do so much.
The Voice Acting for Sword Art Online is well, okay. I particularly liked Tomatsu Haruka's performance as Asuna, and Kirito's voice is well off enough. But other than those two I wasn't particularly compelled or struck by anyone's voice.
Character:
Overall, the characters of Sword Art Online are bland Archetypes of already popular character types present in the Anime Community. Little to no variety is visible from their obvious personas.
Kirito is a lame protagonist, being the typical 13-year old who wishes to be the best at what they do, in this case, video games. Like I previously mentioned, all his various power in the story is given no logical explanation and is more often or not just present to make Kirito cooler in the eyes of the Audience which it spectacularly fails at doing. But to make us support him in his endeavors. Which is really hard to do given how absolutely dumb and naive Kirito is sometimes. Constantly ignoring obvious solutions to simple problems in favor of over dramatization.
His Development is crappy, and he's still essentially the same person at the end of the story, with minor changes to his character that come without any valid explanation or logical reason.
Asuna Meanwhile, in my opinion, is the typical Tsundere. Yes, she is likable, but just like Kirito sometimes her character frustrates me when it comes to the very simple problems presented in some of the subplots of SAO. Her actions are always predictable, and sometimes even don't make any sense/ are out of character.
Overall she's nice and a decent character, but compared to the many other Anime heroines out there, isn't much as her unique position in the story isn't fully explored/taken advantage of.
The other characters in SAO are what I'd like to call bland and generic. They lack any kind of vibrant or recognizable personality as they can pretty much identify as the exact Archetype which they are modeled after within the story.
Enjoyment:
Like I previously mentioned, when I initially watched Sword Art Online, I enjoyed the crap out of it, but after I got over my initial excitement. What remained was the failure of a compelling story, laden with plot holes and numerous irrational actions within the story.
One might enjoy it he or she decides to turn off any part of his mind that covers critical thinking because without taking time to think about what's actually going on in the plot, you might find for yourself an okay anime.
Overall:
Sword Art Online is a sad tale of what-ifs and could've beens.
It had so much potential to become a great anime with its (At the time) inventive concept regarding being trapped in fictional game worlds
Yet it spectacularly failed to present anything meaningful throughout the course of its 25 episode runtime.
If one wanted to really try and give it a shot, by all means go for it. You might enjoy it like I did when I originally saw it, but if you come into it with a critical mind and lot's of doubts, then it's almost a guarantee that it won't be an enjoyable experience.
For all of these reasons and more, I have decided to rate Sword Art Online a 4/10. It's not terrible by any means, but in my honest opinion it is not worth your time watching it as it is a below average anime that got it's fame by change riding on the coat tails of the then emerging VR technology.",4
"
                I got really into this the first few episodes as did many other people. I probably enjoyed this a lot more than most because i didn't mind that it turned a lot less shounen. For me, I liked how there was fighting but also a romance aspect to it. I think it had the perfect amount of action and romance mixed together. I would have probably given it a ten had the second arc been just as good. The first arc did a good job making the main girl a really strong and independent person but the second arc kind of ruined it and pretty
                  much took her out. This was really disappointing because she was one of the part that made the first arc amazing. The second arc also, and THIS MIGHT BE A SPOILER, made this random love triangle that was just unnecessary because there was never any doubt of what he was going to do. The storyline for the second arc is also pretty cliche, and not very original. If this consisted of only the first arc, it would have EASILY gotten a 10/10 from me. But even though the second arc was not that great, i still recommend watching it because it was pretty entertaining and pretty good in general.",9
"
                Sword Art Online was exciting the first time I watched it. I admit, I legitimately enjoyed the anime. However, I do admit to some form of ""fanboying"".
The anime's plot of having 10,000 players stuck in a virtual reality game and such was good. The storyline quickly plummeted though, as there was a lack of character development and too many time jumps. I feel the BIGGEST problem with SAO was the story. Such a good plot could have created one of the best animes, but the plot WAS rushed and didn't turn out.
The artstyle wasn't bad. It's the kind I'm used to, and probably many others.
                  Good graphics, but the battle expressions were a bit off, mostly Kirito's during major battles. The fight scenes were also well made, if a bit rushed sometimes. Sound effects. Sure, they were good. Why not?
Another major issue would be the characters. Kirito, Asuna, and the rest are indeed likable. It's easy to get attached. Looking into their personality in-depth does show many lacking details. Kirito can be described as a generic character. Asuna has a overall better character, although around a third into the anime, it takes a complete dive. Other characters are fine, but the main characters' lack of personality can ruin the anime.
SAO was enjoyable. Technically it's bad. Casually, it can be enjoyable.
This anime had such a good chance! With a plot like this, you could've created the best fantasy anime about a virtual reality game! Unfortunately, the plot was wasted and the anime turned out like a flat loaf of bread. Created by the same people, Accel World had a much better plot, characters, and everything else. Let's just leave SAO at mediocre.",6
"
                SAO is overhyped and garbage, no plot, and Kirito is a fucking retard. Fuck you Kirito.
Ok, onto the review.
Story: 6
The story is the best part if you zoom out. If you zoom in and look at the details, it's retarded. The general plot is that you're stuck in it and until one dude beats the game (cough cough kirito), you're all stuck. Oh, btw, if you die in the game, HAAA SUCK A DICK, U DED!!! BTW, Kirito beats it without trying, lol.
If you zoom into the plot, it's retarded. Kirito goes to floor he's already completed off screen, meets a newb girl, girl wants
                  his dick, he goes like PSYCH and gives her half his dick and fucks Asuna in front of them. :D
Art: 6
It was ok, not as good as Attack on Titan or Bakemonogatari, won't increase the final score though
Sound:
Watched with sound off, gave the average of everything else, however it was ok. Song was good, but wasn't synced with the visuals. Refer to Death Note Intro 1 to learn how to sync.
Characters:4
Kirito is a retarded Gary Stue dumbass who's literally perfect in every way in a growth orientated anime. This isn't 1 punch man, (Saitama isn't perfect either) or Overlord. Both MCs have insecurities that make them good characters, while Kirito has absolutely no problems.
Asuna is generic female character (Go into a random game, choose default female character, make her tsundere, tadah, Asuna). No personality apart from tsundere, doesn't do it as well as Kurisu or Tohsaka, but still, it was done sort of ok.
Person that Kirito roasts in episode 1. Totally forgot his name, he's useless, nobody likes him, doesn't matter that much to the plot. If he's deleted, it's ok, no difference.
Insert Kirito Harem member: Useless dumb shits that don't appear after their episode.
Enjoyment: 3
I just can't get why people like it. Are you 12???
Overall: 4
It was an ok isekai. That's it. That's all I'm willing to say. Isekai is bad, (Maou sama retry, How not to fuck with a demon lord or whatever, Isekai wa smartphone, get it?) I can't get why people like it. It's a bad story saved by a good company and good singer. Now go roast everyone who likes SAO",4
"
                SAO is one of those anime where one either loves it or hates it- so, naturally, I chose both. A little forewarning: this review assumes previous knowledge of the light novels. With that out of the way, let's dive right in to the controversy.
Story- This is mostly where my quiffs are. The story was, in short, an utter disappointment. They set up for a really solid story, with enough content possible to cover a full shonen series. They then preceded to throw all the potential they built up in the first 2 episodes down the drain and spend over half the first arc introducing each
                  member of Kirito's harem- all of whom do nothing else the rest of the season. By the time they finally get back to the actual plot, they timeskipped through 2 years of missed potential, only to throw away every ounce of potential and turn the second arc into another super mario bros game.
Art- The art is pretty amazing, especially in the battle scenes. 
Sound- Easily the best part of the series, the soundtrack for SAO is simply breathtaking. The OP's themselves are good, but not to the point that any one stands out. They're all just solid. And then the battle music- I have only one word to describe the battle themes. EPIC. Just listen to Swordland or Luminous Sword in the background while watching the art set forth by Aniplex- especially the first floor boss fight in EP 2. You will understand.
Characters- The worst character development I have seen in an anime to date. There is only really one character- the male protagonist known as Kirito IG- or Kazuto Kirigaya IRL. And man is he a disappointment of a main character. He is a antisocial solo player- in an mmo game- and still manages to be the best player in the game. Like, he's way too OP for his own good. Other than Kirito, every other character falls into one of 4 categories:
1.) A female, in which case instantly becomes a part of Kirito's harem after 1 episode of introduction, then proceeds to do nothing the rest of the series.
2.) A male supporting character that is so overshadowed by Kirito that they get about 20 mins of screentime per season. 
3.) An antagonist that either has no motive or is too laughable to be a villain.
4.) Asuna. Kirito's love interest. Debuted in ep 2, she showed so much potential as an amazing female lead. And then she became Princess Peach.
Enjoyment- This series is easily one of the most enjoyable anime I have watched, for the sole reason that I apply to the target audience of antisocial gamers who would love nothing better than to be in Kirito's place. Anyone unfamiliar or uninterested in MMO's will find very little enjoyment in this series. And, of course, the look and sound helped, too. 
Overall, this anime is a disappointment, but makes up for the story and characters with superb music and art. I don't recommend this to anyone who doesn't find enjoyment out of a video game, but if that's your thing dive right in, cause it's gonna be a ride.",7
"
                There will be spoilers, because they are the main problem I have with this show. You have been warned.
Story: 2/10
Sword Art Online started out strong and very enjoyable in Aincrad. The premise of being trapped in a virtual world and dying in real life if killed in the game is one which I personally do find to be quite interesting, and if they had kept this, I probably would have liked this show. However, multiple times throughout the initial arc of Sword Art Online, they made plot elements which completely went against this premise and defied the logic of the game. The first time this
                  happens is very early on, when Kirito's entire party gets killed and he tried to get a one-time event item that he could use to bring back a girl whom he had told would be safe. While it turned out that this item had to be used within about 10 seconds after the character died, this broke the logic of the show because once you're dead in this game your brain is fried. Later, at the end of this arc, there was an infuriatingly rushed scene on Floor 75 after fighting the boss, where Kirito reveals that it was Heathcliff, the guild leader, was actually Kayaba Akihiko, the creator of SAO, all along, and that he was going to be the final boss on Floor 100. While he paralyzes everyone in the room but Kirito, they fight until Asuna, Kirito's wife in the game and the main heroine, overcomes paralysis out of sheer will apparently, intercepts Kayaba's attack and dies, at which point Kirito loses all morale and is also killed. While it would only make sense that at this point they would be dead for good, Kirito comes back to life and kills Kayaba, winning the game and allowing everyone to log out, with both him and Asuna somehow alive. Yet, the worst part of this story is yet to come. After the Aincrad arc is Alfheim Online, a game with no risk of death in which Asuna was trapped after leaving the game. Kirito has to save Asuna, previously a power female character and now a damsel in distress, from a man who wants to marry and rape her. On his way, Asuna escapes, only to be greeted with tentacle monsters who try rape her for... some reason. Maybe? Kirito finally makes it to where she is, leading to the worst scene in any show that I can think of, an NTR scene in which Asuna is nearly raped until Deus ex Kayaba comes and lets Kirito control the game, dropping the villain's level to one and pain tolerance to 0 and killing him in the game, destorying any logic left whatsoever.
Art and Sound: 9/10
The art and sound in SAO are really the highlight of the show. This show looks polished, with interesting character designs and great looks to Alfheim and especially Aincrad. As for the music, the OST is amazing and done by one of anime's best-known composers: Yuki Kajiura. I don't have much to complain about s far as these categories go.
Character: 5/10
I don't especially hate most of the main characters, although I do really hate the antagonist of the second arc. Kirito is overpowered to an insane and illogical degree, but I didn't mind this that much personally. Asuna was a great character and I thought that she was one of the better ones in the show. More minor character like Klein was enjoyable (better than Kirito). Kirito's sister, Suguha, can be basically summed up in one term: brother-complex. She was not particularly great and there was too much focus on her in a sexual way which there should not have been at all. Yui, an AI who was Kirito's and Asuna's ""daughter"" was cute, but not an interesting character, and the way she was brought back in the second half of the show was ridiculous, breaking the logic of the show (although, is there really any logic to it in the first place?). The worst character in the show is the villain of the Alfheim arc, Sugou. His entire character was that he wanted to marry and rape Asuna because he was a comically evil person, without any nuance to his motivations.
Enjoyment: 4/10
For the first half, I was definitely enjoying the show a lot, I cannot lie. It was fun and had an interesting premise as well as a genuine romance, not seen in many shows, which I enjoyed. But once the Aincrad arc ended, my enjoyment plummeted, and at the end of episode 24, I was genuinely angry about what I was watching.
Overall: 3/10
I went into this wanting to like it, despite all I'd heard about it. But because of the awful logic-breaking events of the show and just bad writing all around, I believe that this was just a bad show. I understand why many people love it, but I couldn't stand much of it.",3
"
                I'm being incredibly generous with my rating here.
I started watching this anime, despite the many controversies I overheard about it online, upon hearing it was aligned along the lines of virtual reality. 
Story: 6/10
A 6 out of 10 is viewed as 'fair' which, I have to say is what I originally thought when I first watched the anime. The first episode set the scene quite nicely however, it paled in comparison to pilot episodes of other shows. This idea of being trapped inside a video game has been overused for decades but this was one of the first I had seen it being used in
                  an anime. At first, it was enthralling to watch Kirito, our protagonist, suffer in this 'real' world and become accustomed to his surroundings. The characters (the ones that were introduced in the first episode) were... a little realistic? However, it became clear there was nothing really driving the story (other than the man behind the whole being stuck in the game in the first place) and soon you'll become bored as Kirito continues life (in a somewhat mundane fashion). I have to say, as soon as Asuna was introduced, it all fell apart from there. The ending of the season with the fighters at LEVEL 75 (not 100) and soon having to face the reality that they might never escape, almost saved the show if were not for the fact that the 'boss' decided to fight them anymore even if they hadn't reached level 200. From that point on, the writers of this anime was trying to continue the franchise desperately but naturally that is difficult when Kirito has already escaped the game. So what do they do? Have Asuna kidnapped. Of course, anime often undermines woman and presents them as pitable however, in this case it was ridiculous. The idea of Asuna being kidnapped went against her originally brave demeanour from when Kirito first meets her and it becomes clear the writers went against her character and followed the damsel-in-distress trope.
Art: 5/10
A 5 out of 10 is viewed as 'mediocre' which I must say fits this very well. This anime ought to have been beautifully drawn and empowering in terms of video games however, it was screwed over by sloppy writers who clearly didn't think before they did anything. Half the scenes mirror each other but are drawn in ever so slightly different ways and there's no real satisfaction I normally recieve when looking at well-drawn characters. By the end of the first season, I was disappointed in the writer and animator's skills. They could have done so much better and portrayed the very realistic terms of virtual reality but nope, they just didn't.
Sound: 6/10
Considering the fact that this show revolves around something as interesting as video games, meaning that the sound of gunshots and screams were naturally a normality in the anime, it failed to comprehend it. The voice actors lacked something that ought to have made the show more audibly and visually good. Asuna's character was... I'm sorry... a dud. Actually, scratch that I'm not sorry. Her voice actor could have done better, there's no need to make every single female character a high-pitched boobed cariacture.
Character: 4/10
Here's where is gets juicy. A 4 out of 10 means 'decent', perfect to describe this. Yes, there are some who might argue it ought to be lower however, when I say 'decent' I mean the characters were barely good. Some were 'poor' of course, perhaps deserving a 3 but in terms of an average, I would have to raise it to a 4. And I'm being very kind here.
Asuna is simply used to draw out Kirito's bravery and impressing qualities, portraying him to be the saviour. She could have been much, much better. It's rare when animes get an empowered, video-gaming teenager like her. She could have held her own however, our first meeting of her already shows us she is meant to be Kirito's love interest and nothing more, nothing less. 
Kirito was screwed over more times than I can count. His character arc fell apart several times, especially when he wishes to settle down with Asuna despite the fact that he is a TEENAGER. A video-gaming, goddamn nerdy teenager. It's like the writers just abandoned everything and made him out to be the best person in the entire world. Kirito, you could have been so much better.
Words can't describe my somewhat passive hatred against Yui. She's a dramatic device thrown into the mix for diversity perhaps because the writers were getting bored of the trash they were making. Personally, I find her quite lame and redundant, used to try and draw together a 'family' in this cruel virtual world. 
Klein, whom I actually liked a bit because of his comical attitude, becomes a side character later on, originally used to make Kirito less of a loner in the first few episodes before we meet other characters. His friendship with Kirito was almost actually nice, if it were not for the fact that they just seperated and went on different paths because the writers wanted a more romance-driven plotline.
Enjoyment: 5/10
I gave up after season 2, fed up with the trashy and poorly executed plotlines and character arcs. This was an anime that could have risen to the top with a better storyline and personalities for the characters. This was the second anime I've ever seen I could likely be harsh due to high expectations but from what I've heard, no one think this show is above a 5.
Overall: 6/10
Fair.
If you're video gamer like me and enjoy plotlines like that, maybe watch the first season and give up after that. Other than that, don't watch this anime unless you want to have an enduring rage against poorly written characters and terrible unrealistic aspects of video gaming and virtual reality. Thank you!",6
"
                Sword Art online, a virtual MMO, while everyone was happy it finally been released to everyone they find themselves trapped in the game and only way to get out was to beat the game, but if you die in the game you die in real life.
story- Story is pretty solid, you have your main character that likes to be a SOLO player and he tries to beat the game to save everyone, later he was forced to join a guild after loosing at a battle with the Knight of Blood guild where he has to go clear one of the 100 floors with a team,
                  while he only likes being a SOLO player, he falls in love with a girl name asuna who is in the same guild as him, they both take a vacation in the game for 2 weeks and talk about how they will live their lives together after they beat the game, they have a child in the game name yui, he teams up with asuna and a few members of the KOB guild and other random guilds to clear a floor where he kills the final boss and SAO is finally no more. Kirito (main character) being happy and finally clearing the game, he tries to find asuna and finds out she still has not awaken from the game, he soon later finds out she is trapped in another game, so he gets the game and tries to save her before anything bad happens to her.
Art- this anime has to be the best art i seen in a long time, you have so many cities and towns to see in the MMO and every detail seems perfect,
Sound- Sound is really good, i do not really know how to judge when it comes to sound cause i am not using my surround sound speakers, but if the sound comes in good with crappy laptop speakers then i am sure the sound is perfect.
Character- You get the feel of every character, which i am starting to like, you get a chance to get behind and see whats happening with every main character, especially with yui, asuna and kirito.
Enjoyment- as you see i gave it a 9/10, even though i really like this anime and for people who know when i write reviews its because i really enjoyed it, the anime just seems a little fast paste, didn't really show him leveling and killing regular monsters, 1 day hes level 1 then somehow hes level 50 in the next episode and you're just like ""how the hell?"" and it turns into a big love story out of know where in the middle of the anime, it didn't even look like it would be a romance anime until you pass the middle of it. 
overall- overall is a good anime, the manga is still ongoing, so i hope they come out with a third season, would really like to continue the series, i am too lazy to read another manga, i still have gantz to read, but hopefully we will see a new season soon.",9
"
                In the end, it all comes down to personal taste but I would have this in my consciousness if I didn't write a report on this one.
When you finish an anime and you feel complete in all levels but still wish there was more, then you know the developers must have done something right.
The story was pretty original and the developers did their best to express how serious the situation the characters got into was. The qualities expressed within the anime, the power of the human will, the will to survive, to protect the things you care about, and to live a normal life despite
                  the circumstances, all these were shown perfectly on this one. The battles were great and the atmosphere was perfect. 
And in addition to all that, there is also the element of romance (which I really enjoy in any Action/Adventure anime i watch). Normally I would be satisfied with the romantic relationship just developing in the last episode but this anime went way beyond my expectations. To be exact, it gave us a lot more than that and in the perfect balance. The relationship was developed many episodes before the final one, and it was a serious relationship at that. During the last few episodes, the main character also had to fight for his girl. It was the element of romance at its finest, without it shading the whole action of the story.
I dont really know why I stuck to the (still very good but not perfect) 9/10 when grading it in my list. If I had to find a thing I did not like as much, then that would be (WARNING, MINOR SPOILER) that I did not like the second MMO game, Alfheim as I did with Sword Art. In SAO I really wanted to be part of the game, to actually have the chance to play it, while in Alfheim I just watched to see how the story ended without admiring the features and the game itself as much.
To make a long story short, Sword Art Online litterally ""raised the bar"" for me as for what to expect of an anime. Watching this has been a pleasant experience for me and I would certainly consider rewatching it in the near future.",9
"
                This anime was overall pure amazing! Keep in mind this is only Season 1, and haven’t seen Season 2. I’m gonna go over each category one by one, so let’s start with Story.
Story: I really liked the story of this anime. 
I like how it draws you in. For instance, at one point about halfway through, I had no idea how the anime was going to continue. It could have honestly been finished at that point. But it wasn’t.
And of course, I’m a sucker for romance, which it has quite a bit of!
10/10
Art: It was just visually appealing. Nice art style and some very beautiful
                  scenes. What more must I say.
10/10
Sound:
I liked some of the sound effects. And I watched the English dub, but the intros are catching and I like Kirito’s voice.
Nothing extraordinary though.
8/10
Character: 
I liked all of the characters.
But some of them were a bit dull.
The villains were a bit two dimensional, and the protagonists were admittedly a big overpowered (not too too overpowering though)
8/10
Enjoyment:
I really liked watching this anime.
I started off slow, but once I got to the 10th episode or so, I finished the rest in a matter of days.
Enjoyable.
9/10
Overall: For all the reasons, above, it was awesome!
10/10",10
"
                Let's keep it simple, in overall I enjoyed it very much altough there were some things that I did not like.
I simply love the idea of getting inside of a game like Sword Art Online and I still dream about being able to play a game like SAO before I die... So that was like a bonus for the Anime.
Kirito is the main character and I like how the character (Kirito) develops throughout the series so I have nothing to say about that.
The thing that I hate the most is the fact that every girl that is friends with Kirito just wants to date him.
                  HAREMS bro. --.--
That just ruined the whole thing... I still like the show but yeah... whatever.
I don't have much more to say about it because the last time I saw it was about 5 or 6 months ago and I've been watching better Animes so I kind of forgot Sword Art Online a little bit...
Still, it's a good show if you like Action, Harem, and a bit of Drama and Romance.
Of course that there are a lot of haters of SAO out there but don't listen to them. They hate everything that becomes popular.",8
"
                Yeah...
About time I talk about this one isn't it?
Okay, so first off, I know what you're thinking: *sarcastic voice*""Oh, Cludensyo, you're joining the bandwagon; reviewing Sword Art Online and giving it a low score. What a way to redirect your rage to an otherwise easy target."" and... you're probably right. But you've gotta understand my situation. It's been 3 years already (1 or 2 since I've watched it) and inside my mind, my memories of this anime are not showing any signs of fading away into obscurity. So today, I'll try to make peace with this series─ shed every thought I have to this show
                  in the hopes that I will achieve serenity. BUT, let's be diplomatic about this for a change; acknowledging the opinion of both sides (the fans and the haters) and try to come to an objective conclusion (something I thought this show was gonna do). Let's start!
So, as I've said before, it's been 3 years ever since the first season raided the airwaves of Japan (and the World Wide Web) and between that time and today, I've been graced with the luxury to have some ""civilized"" chat to the fans who like this show (and by civilized I mean we were at war like it was the feudal era. I almost resorted to insulting their mothers. Almost.) So with that in mind, were my thoughts about this show, at the very least, shaken? Have I come to understand the perspective of the fans that actually like this show? To that, I answer a resounding... no. Well, not really. I don't hate this show because of its story or its characters, and certainly not because of its animation quality or sound. No, I still hate this show because it's a FUCKING LIAR. Pay attention because this is important: In retrospect, I think I would've enjoyed the show as much the fans did. Yeah, I said it.
Basing from the talks I had with the SAO fans and what their feedback was on the series' second season (which I also made a review. And a very subjective one at that. Thought I should point that out), SAO's intentions and quite frankly, its best asset is the show just having fun with the idea of living in a virtual world. And honestly, I'm down with that. I can enjoy shows that are meant to be enjoyed for what it's worth from time to time. Whether it's an in-your-face comedy or a mind-shattering sci-fi drama, I'll take a gander. Which leads me to SAO's biggest mistake (and the reason I called this show a ""fucking liar""); it's first 3 episodes.
In my aforementioned review about the 2nd season of this franchise, I've regarded these fabled first 3 episodes as ""the best part of the 1st season"" and its ""saving grace"" because it left a good impression on me on what kind of world am I going to traverse, what tone it’s gonna have, and what will be the characteristics of our heroes (and I think it's safe to say I'm not alone on this). But some 3 years (or some time lapse if that’s not exact) pass and we don’t even get to see what happened during that time (unless you’re the mega fan that you are and have read the light novels). Our scared and vulnerable main protagonist becomes an emotionless, brooding, black-cladded swordsman that’s way above everyone’s levels, the female lead that was introduced as a badass and an independent woman who don’t need no man to hold her hand becomes pussified and you have no idea how or why. And the story, the underlying themes of ontology and the commentary on human nature, what happened to them? Never mentioned again. Only when it’s convenient or when it helps raise the tension or the weight of importance of a scene, as if the creators are reminding you that they’re still trying to tell a profound story. Guys, even Heaven’s Lost Property had a better anime adaptation than this. Yes, they’ve toned down the original story’s grit and seriousness to ludicrous levels, but they’re consistent by it (Eternal My Master, we’ll see). And sure, they have some (and I use this term very loosely) serious moments but they’re shown at the latter part of the story, NOT THE FIRST EPISODES.
This makes me wonder if the second season showed little-to-no regard about the story as its first season and just had fun with this world, would I have allowed myself to be won over by the show and actually like it that way? Maybe. But as it stands, Sword Art Online has an array of adaptations that are, in terms of consistency, unpolished─ much like a lot of video games today ironically.
So, here comes the final question: Would I recommend you to watch this show? You know what, yeah. Why not? Just know what you’re getting into because Lord knows I didn’t.",5
"
                Sword Art Online is probably the most disappointing anime I've ever seen in my life.  
Art:
I'll start off with the good things about the show just so you guys understand what I mean by disappointing.  The art style is pretty good aside from the unnecessary sexualization of Asuna in the second world as well as making Kirito an elf but whatever.  The show is pretty, the landscapes are vast, and most importantly, the virtual reality worlds make me want to go visit these worlds myself, and I think for a show that tries to capitalize on the dreams and fantasies of an
                  otaku fanbase, that's what matters to most.  Action sequences, more often than not, get me hyped.  There are even some first person shots that show that the characters actually see a HUB in there periphery which was a wonderful touch, again making the audience believe that this is a real game.  
One more aspect of character design that struck out to me was exactly how deranged and angry this anime could make people look.  These kids were looking as crazy as Evangelion characters at some points, so that's also something to appreciate as it nods to the psychological aspect of the show that I just WISH the show fleshed out more.  
Sound:
As for sound, music sounds like general JRPG music.  Again, immersion for an otaku fanbase: Achieved.  Swords clash when they clash.  Digitalized cuts sound digitalized, again pointing out that this is VR, so that's cool.  Sound design is good.   
Character:
Shit.  You've heard it a million times.  Kirito is a unlikeable bitch that all the girls love, and the girls are as one-dimensional as the archetypes they represent, if not more.  Asuna, the one character I had the most hope for, was reduced to a plaything, a damsel in distress, by the end of the show, to the point where she almost gets graphically sexually assaulted.  And that's not okay.  Moving on.  
Story:
Shit.  
Not just because the story is bad, but because it could've been so good.  The idea of a VRMMORPG is a fantasy that many otakus have dreamed of for a long time.  Getting trapped in one, while not a new idea, is a fear that I'd imagine would freak everyone out in the real world just as it did in the show.  Having to battle your way out in a fantasy world where you can die even though you're just a normal city boy is an absolutely WONDERFUL premise.  
That's why it's so hard to see this show shit on the idea so hard with bullshit characters, time skips, little to no character development, game mechanics and practices that don't make sense, and the what just may be considered as rape.  
Enjoyment:
At the beginning, I enjoyed it a lot.  I had high hopes.  I could've given you a 9 for like the first three episodes.  But because this show shit on my hopes and dreams for a good anime with this type of premise, it really is unforgivable.  Dreadful.  As in, a 2, its only saving grace being that it looks kinda pretty sometimes.  
Watch it with some friends just so that you can hate it and complain about how stupid it became.

                SAO was a huge disappointment for me. I expected good things from this series when I first started watching it, but as the episodes went by I slowly realized how much of a trainwreck it was going to be. Don't get me wrong, the initial idea of the anime is great, but the way it was realized is really disappointing.
Also, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch this. Actually, you HAVE to watch this so that you realize why I was so disappointed. Plus, if you watch it you will be able to partecipate in the endless flame war between SAO fanboys and SAO haters.
First of
                  all, I absolutely hated how the main character and his group never really face any real crisis - Kirito basically never loses and there really aren't moments where you feel sad for the characters, as they always end up winning pretty quickly and predictably.
Another issue I've had with this anime is that the narration is horrible. The first half of the anime skips over a ton of characters that only appear a few times and end up forgotten. Moreover, the relationship between Asuna and Kirito starts off way too fast, not giving the viewer the time to start emphatizing with the characters, so the romance is horrible and not moving at all.
On the other hand, the second half of the anime was actually decent and the narration was okay as well, but that's not enough to make up for all of the initial mistakes.
If all of that isn't enough of a dealbreaker, there is no character development at all: the characters are the exact same as they were in the first episode. No weak characters has gotten stronger, noone's personality changed, nothing. It's as if the show was designed to go on forever with the same characters joining different MMORPGs every new season.
The lack of real crisis and proper romance ultimately annhilates any enjoyment I could've gotten out of this series. I'll still give it a 6/10 because the initial idea was good and the chara design is good.",6
"
                Now, let me tell ya' about SAO.....It's fucking terrible. Kirito is a asshole and Asuna is a whiny bitch. I really don't know why I even bothered to watch the whole anime because the characters were so plain I felt like they were fucking bread without any jelly on it, just some plain ass bread because what kind of psycho eats bread without jelly or whatever you eat your bread with to make it enjoyable. Anyways, the music was okay I guess and the art style was fair. The story didn't really amaze me but it wasn't terrible..
But in a nutshell, I do not like
                  SAO.",1
"
                I will use small words.
I will be short and precise.
I will include NO spoilers.
This anime was very much like the light novels, but it was also lacking.  The light novels had much more on the characters that the audience could see and the story was easier to understand.  In the anime, an episode can jump from one stage in the protagonist's life, to another with inadequate representation.  I believe that 25 episodes was not a sufficient amount time to fit in three years of the story.  It just does not make sense to attempt to fit in four volumes of the
                  light novels into 25 episodes, in which each episode lasts only 23 minutes.  Entirely mediocre.
Does this mean the anime is bad? of course not.  I say mediocre because it is neither good nor bad.
This is a very good presentation of the light novels, but it is not perfect.  Think about it: if you were to fit in four award-winning novels into 25 episodes, less than 600 minutes, and only 9½ hours, would you do any better?  The story in the anime only had the important parts, only a partial amount of themes the audience should have experienced, and little character development.
All in all, the series was in fact enjoyable.  I have not been able to immerse my imagination into an anime series since the younger days of ""Naruto"" or ""One Piece"".",8
"
                There may have actually been series i would consider worse than the first season of sword art online, Aho Girl as an example. Still Aho Girl got a higher rating from me because of one simple reason:
Aho Girl never managed to disgust me in a way this series did near the end of this season. Actual rape depictions in a series that up to this point was mostly made with a younger audience in mind.
Everything it does right in the slightest is in my opinion overshadowed by the massive amount of flaws.
Nice Art and an OK soundtrack can't make up for that either...
There aren't any
                  engaging characters apart from Asuna during actual SAO, which also got thrown overboard with the second arc, where she spends the entire time locked away and...... ugh... getting sexually assaulted by some ass-pull villain.
Totally confused on how this series ever got a rating above 7.5 and over 1.3 million members on this website.",1
"
                Since I've seen an army of 10's for this show, I thought that I would write a much more realistic review on Sword Art Online. 
Sword Art Online 
Directed by: Tomohiko Itou 
Created by: Reki Kawahara 
Based on: Light Novel (Volumes 1-4)
Story (7/10): Sword Art Online (SAO) is an Anime about an avid gamer named Kazuto Kirigaya (""Kirito"") who decides to play a VRMMO called Sword Art Online or SAO for short. Here's the twist. The creator of the game, Akihiko Kayaba, has designed the game so that if you die in SAO, you die in the real world. Also, the only way to survive
                  is to beat all 100 levels in the game and then will be free and able to return to real life. Now knowing of this, Kirito is determined more than anything to survive. This is a very good story with two problems being concerned. 1) the supporting characters don't get much time to shine. 2) the incest between Kirito and Suguha in the 2nd arc of the anime (occurs somewhere in episodes 15-25). Overall, a good story with just two major problems that knock it down to a 7. 
Art (8/10): The art is fantastic. Colorful characters, vivid imagery and great backgrounds. It's easily worth an 8. Very good. 
Sound (9/10): The best part of SAO. I love the music and especially the ending Yume Sekai by Haruka Tomatsu (who is also the voice actress of Asuna) One of my all-time favorite Anime ending themes. The music is just great. 
Characters (7/10): Kirito is not the greatest character ever as I can't stand that he is perfect at everything. However, Asuna wasn't terrible. Klein and Suguha are my favorite characters though and they were a huge plus in my opinion. Overall, the characters are good for the most part. 
Enjoyment (8/10): I enjoyed this show pretty much for the must part. Nothing else to say. 8/10. 
Overall (8/10): Overall, SAO to me is a very good but flawed show. 8/10.",8
"
                Only one life? Sounds like some hard core game right? Well this isnt a game, and that life is your actual life on the line...
Story:
This is one of my favorite stories. For our time where the gaming industry is rapidly developing due to advancements like the Kinect, the reality of being the character in the game is not so far fetched. Also since video games are a major part in the lives of many people, concepts like life bars and skill trees are easy to understand and make for an interesting story. (10)
Art:
A dynamic art style for a action packed visual anime. The art is
                  awesome, the way characters move around and fight are well animated and action packed. Watching as your favorite character finishes off a mighty monster is just epic. (10)
Sound:
The sound make the anime. The dynamic music during action scenes put you on edge as you watch the characters movements. Then during heart pounding love scenes that make you want to cry the music plays along to further develop the scene. Vocals are also well recorded and fit in well for the characters they fill in for. (10)
Character:
Well developed and loving characters. You learn to love the characters as they are developed fairly well in this short anime. You won't want any character to be lost to this game from hell because of how well they are developed and the impact they make to you and the story. Only thing preventing a perfect score is character trait changes halfway through the show. (9)
Enjoyment:
This is where things go hairy. I enjoyed this anime, yet i also didn't. This anime is by far a great watch for any anime lover. But it all goes down halfway through the first season where major characters from the first half make almost no appearance and a main character goes from a strong character to a damsel in distress. It was still very good but with these character changes and some other small details changed, it makes the first half of the first season more enjoyable than the second. (8)
This anime was one of my favorites, until half way through. lots of great moments that have feeling put into them. The anime is also much better than the manga equivalent, it improves and puts it in its dust. But the fatal flaw of SAO is that it cuts off from the main story element too early halfway through. This takes a great idea, a great story, great characters, and something beautiful, and turns it  into a cheesy prince saving the princess story that doesn't fulfill my wants in an action packed anime. SAO is filled with great moments that you won't forget, but because of a horrid half way season climax and the second part of the season it losses all of its luster. I love this anime, it goes under one of my favorites, but because of a bad decision it ruins the story majorly. A great show that outdoes its manga and makes something great. It pains me to give it a 7/10 because of how much of an impact it made to me. But i can't let the fact that poor decisions were made, and so the score is deserving.
Thank you: and,
Live long and prosper under the light of the sun.",7
"
                There are already a lot of reviews for SAO, so I'll keep my review relatively concise. For the sake of this I'll keep it in order of my ratings for each section. I can't say that I didn't enjoy it on some level, I watched it all the way to the end. I do have gripes with the series overall, but there were some episodes that stood out from the others. I feel as though the concept could have been worked much better, and that's really the most disappointing part of the series.
First off, is the story. The story in SAO is an interesting setup,
                  guy logs into new MMO, everyone is trapped inside and they have to work to clear the 100 floors or die (quite literally) trying. This, at first is promising, we can explore themes of community, online gaming, identity, what drives people to game, and maybe even see some cool monster designs etc. The themes are really only present through the first 10 or so episodes, they do explore a little bit of each of the themes I mentioned (though not very deeply at all), but this quickly gives way to a hamfisted and tacky teenage love subplot that I found myself groaning through in just about every episode after ep. 14 or so. It continues on through the end of the series, and becomes a driving force for one of the characters to soldier on. There are also a few loose threads left, and some things they completely brush aside to address near the end of the series, but the resolutions just comes off as very half-baked and rushed.
The art and sound I didn't have any gripes with, on the contrary I found the art style to be detailed and the monster and character designs were often interesting. About midway through the season there is a shift and the art style changes to accommodate it (trying to avoid spoilers here), which I thought was handled well and made sense in context. As for sound, it was well done, there are sword clashes and clangs, and various sounds you'd expect in a video game. Surprisingly I didn't have much issue with the dub either, I found it very well done (probably due to the popularity of the show).
Ah, the characters. This is also where I draw some issues. Obviously Kirito, being the main character, is the character with the most depth. The writers do a decent job with his character growth, but he doesn't feel like a really fleshed out character, as his backstory is alluded to a few times but never really explored. There are two main female characters (one appearing much later), but they seem to serve as window dressing, we don't know much about them, they don't really seem to grow as characters much, and the writers don't seem to care much about developing them much outside of the archetypal lovesick teenage girl. Most of the side characters show up occasionally and fade back into the background of the show, some show up for an episode or two never to be seen again.
The antagonists of the series are very shallow, the first we never really get any understanding of who he is, what he wants, what he was trying to achieve, nothing. This left me wanting to know more, he does speak a little bit about his motivation in one episode, but it doesn't feel like they did enough with him, and then they brush him under the rug entirely. The second antagonist shows up a bit later on, and exhibits, yet again, another character archetype as the classic villain. The creators don't try to give him any sort of gray morality, and they often paint him as a remorseless power hungry rapist who just wants to exercise his power for his oh-so-evil plan to work.
Overall, I'm not really sure why I watched it to the end, maybe to see if they developed the characters more, or explored more interesting themes, but it just never happened. The production values were high, it's just a shame they didn't do more with it.",6
"
                Sword Art Online (SAO) was originally a light novel written in early 2009. The story revolves around a futuristic MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) world called Aincrad. The world comprises of 100 'levels' and on each level there is a boss which needs defeating to reach the next level. 
This anime (set in 2022) follows the events and happenings of Kazuto ""Kirito"" Kirigaya, who, like every player in the game, is unable to log out on the day of release. The only way that they can beat the game, is if they beat the boss on the hundredth floor. [It seems a bit sick
                  to do that to a bunch of people tbh, not sure I'd cope but still, seems pretty cool].
Theres a catch though, as the games creator, Akihiko Kayaba states that if they wish to be free, they must reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss, but if their avatars die in-game, their bodies will also die in the real world. This seems illogical right? Nah, it's 2022 of course theres some kickass thing that makes this reality! It's called 'Nerve Gear', a virtual reality helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain. As a result players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. [seems cool right?]
Kirito was one of 1000 people selected to be a Beta tester for the game and as a result he doesn't seem too phased that he's stuck in the game as he's already acquainted with it. 
[its also because he doesn't really like the world irl as he was always chastised and told he wasn't good enough, so he stayed inside and just played computer games - major feels]
As a result he decides to take the game on, solo, thinking it'd be easy. As the anime progresses, two years pass in the real world and Kirito makes a name for himself within SAO - he meets a girl named Asuna, and its your generic romancy business if I'm honest.
Will Kirito and Asuna beat all 100 levels? What happens if they do? Do they ever 'wake up'? If they do, would Kirito ever put his Nerve Gear back on? All these questions, and only one way to find out!!
Overall, there are some hilarious moments, some moments of complete and utter frustration, some 'awww' moments and obviously some kickass moments.
One of my favourite animes to date, would highly recommend it. The animation in places is absolutely stunning, the scripts are great and the character/viewer relationship is special.
I'm stoked for SAO II, not sure about the storyline but i'll see when it's released in July.
Enjoy the anime.
*NOTE* There was an OVA released on 31st of December 2013, just sums up the entire of season 1 and with a few extra minutes of new SAO goodness!",9
"
                  It is no doubt how divisive Sword Art Online has become. You have people who really love it and people who really hate it. Basically the Phantom Menace  of anime. This review has no nitpicking and is honest. I will also tackle some accusations that I find to be bogus.
 Let's start with the weakest aspect of SAO; the characters. Most of the characters besides Kirito and Asuna either lack sufficient screen time, development, or interest. While Kirito is overpowered at times, he isn't that overpowered as his abilities are only exclusive in the game and is a regular human in the
                  real world who will probably die. It is true that he does have a few a**pulls, but its somehow okay for other anime protagonists such as Yugi Muto to have a**pulls?  While he is accused of being a ""harem protagonist"", he is completely unaware of the feelings that the other female characters besides Asuna exhibit for him nor does he fall in love with them.  Asuna, while starting off as a strong character, becomes a damsel of distress in the series' second half. And there is a DISTURBING scene involving her and the villain of the second half. At least she becomes useful after getting rescued. It would be great to see more of Klein in the anime as he would have been a decent comic relief character. The ""villain"" of the first half was alright but he has a vague motive of why he trapped so many players in the game. The villain of the second half was a total joke. He has a sensible motivation of researching captive players but he has a creepy and weird motivation that involves Asuna. He was also a weak villain as well and gets defeated easily. And people say that MCU villains are ""bad""? In all, the characters are pretty bland at best but not the worst.
 Moving on to the story, it has a rather promising premise but it isn't what it seemed. I would say that the way the story was executed is why many hate it. But the whole concept of ""being trapped in a virtual world"" has been used many times in media such as Tron and .hack so it isn't that special of a premise. While I did enjoy the first half of the series and executes some of the psychological aspects  of being trapped in a virtual world well, it has glaring flaws. The biggest gripe that I had was the pacing which went faster than Barry Allen. It jumps within a year or so in just a few episodes, which leaves out the development of Kirito's skills and his romance with Asuna. The pacing also leaves some plot holes. The structure of the anime is jumbled as the premise is followed for the first 3 episodes but then goes off into some side stories which are not really relevant to the premise before going back around later episodes in the first half. However, I did enjoy some of the side stories. While I did enjoy the romance between Kirito and Asuna, it was honestly rushed. I did not enjoy the second half as much as I did with the first half since it becomes  a generic ""save my bootycall"" story and the villain was whack. However what saved this second half was a decent fight scene between Kirito and Eugene. Other than that, the second half isn't worth watching. There is some controversy over the ""incest"" in the second half but the ""incest"" is only one-sided and it would only be true incest if Kirito confessed his feelings to his sister/cousin. But other anime such as Oreimo actually has incest but everyone seems okay with that? Overall, the story has faults but its alright.
 Moving on to the main positives, the animation and music are pretty well done. The designs of the world and characters are very great looking. I can pause at certain scenes and say ""Man this is beautiful."" The great artwork really makes the fight scenes look breathtaking and adds to the intensity. The music has different tones to match with certain scenes whether it be a fight scene, a sad scene, or a calm scene. Some of my favorite tracks from the OST are the ones with piano pieces. 
 Overall. Sword Art Online isn't as great as people think it is nor is it as bad as others think. It is a beautiful yet flawed anime with some interesting sci-fi concepts that is entertaining watch with some popcorn.",6

                Contains Slight Spoilers!!!
First of all, I'll start with the story.
Story:4
At first I was interested in this anime but then ended up disliking it as the episodes got worse and worse.
 Although the plot is pretty unique, it wasn't very clear, because the pacing was bad, to be honest.  I mean, we know that the goal in the first part of Sword Art Online 1 is for Kirito and some other people to clear the game, but it's like for a few episodes in a row something would be happening, and in another few episodes in a row, something else would be happening. It was
                  kind of just a bunch of little stories jumbled up together that sort of unfold and develop the plot. The episodes got worse and worse as it went on, it could've all just ended at episode 14. I don't get why they had to add the fairy world. It's like there were two bigger stories with small mini-stories in each that make up 1 season.
The romance sucked. SPOILER: In one episode, it showed that Kirito and Asuna would always bicker and quarrel and that Asuna didn't consider him to be even a friend, but then a few episodes later she would always hug him and stuff. End of spoiler. The romance wasn't well developed;it didn't show how their affection for one another grew. 
Nothing about the MMO stuff was well explained. If you haven't played a MMO, you wouldn't understand how the Sword Art Online virtual world worked, like I didn't understand until I learnt about MMO's. You'd only understand a little bit of the story. The leveling up was like ""what?"" cause in one episode Kirito would be level 20 and then in the next he would be level 48 and then level seventy-something. The building guilds (groups of players that help each other out to complete the goal of the game) and solo-players thing wasn't explained well, either. Also, 10,000 people can't play in one server. 
Art:6
The animation was okay in the SAO world. The action scenes weren't that well done. I think the action was alright but could've been done much better, like, it wasn't well detailed. It was sort of a ''Just about 200 slashes and that monster is dead'' kind of thing.
But the art in the fairy-world looked sort of childish. I personally didn't like it at all. 
Sound:7
The sound was probably the only really good thing in this anime to me. The openings and endings were all nice. I personally don't like English dub at all, so I didn't like the dub. The soundtracks were okay.
Character:4
The characters were alright but weren't developed well at all. They didn't each have their own distinct personalities. The main differences among the characters would be things like how the program thing named Yui called Kirito and Asuna ""papa'' and ""mama"", how Kirito cared for life and would rather die with someone than letting them die, how he was level 100, how Asuna would commit suicide if Kirito died, how she was good at cooking, etc.
Enjoyment:4
Sword Art Online could be enjoyable to lots of people but I guess I just personally didn't enjoy it that much. 
Overall: 5/10
If you are looking for a good romance and action anime with good pacing, I wouldn't recommend this one to you.",5

                Sword Art Online
Review By: John Fragglepuss Evans
Sword Art Online had me captivated from the first five minutes of episode one. The idea of merging the virtual world and the real world was fascinating. As one would imagine, there is a lot of humor based on MMORPGs, so if you have played that type of game, you will surely appreciate the humor. The story is interesting from beginning to end, leaving you always wanting more. There is comedy, action, adventure, drama, sadness, and everything in between.
I like how there has been three different types of MMORPG in Sword Art Online. There has been a traditional style
                  with the swords and all that, there has been one with flying, and currently airing for season two there is one with advanced technology and the guns. The different MMORPGs created for the anime have kept it new and refreshing.
You might enjoy this if: You are a fan of a wide variety of genres. This anime puts a lot of them together. It focuses more on the fantasy aspect of the virtual world, just so you are aware. Also, if you have played MMORPGs, you will likely enjoy Sword Art Online.
You might not like it if: You are looking for something more down to earth. This is an anime with more action and less politics.
Note to the Viewer: Be warned, there will be loss and heartache.",8
"
                This is a TL:DR Version, because people below have already stated good reviews and a lot of reviews already grasp the concept that i have going, which is. 
Great series, and when i say series i mean until episode 8'ish, then it takes a nose dive into an empty pool with you going ""WTF?.....why?"" 
SAO Has a amazingly good hook, specially if you are a MMO'er yourself. It has an amazing setup, but then cuts short once the ADD is turned on. It branches off into something you wouldnt even expect such a foreseeable master piece would do. And hence it shoots itself straight in
                  the foot.
Instead of being an ""Epic"" story of Reality and VR, something like the matrix, they went for a romance based story...eventually. Yes this is an enjoyable series, and i stress enjoyable only. But you most likely will feel disappointed if you liked the beginning. 
SAO had the power to sit below Gurren Laggan, but then cut itself short and shot down the ranks so fast i didn't even realize it happened and I had to make sure i was still watching SAO not something else. Because it flipped scenes so fast i practically thought i miss clicked the show i was watching.",7
"
                Sword Art Online is originally a Light Novel, still is. Same person who wrote Accel World. The anime itself is based of Reki Kawahara light novel, that became a huge success since Accel World anime was released. Most people compare this anime to .hack//Sign, Accel World and Log Horizon as the three anime are based in a virtual worlds, in this case Sword Art Online. 
I'll try not to spoil any of the actual story, but the 1st half on the anime starts of quite fast, Kirito enters SAO the game by connecting his actual body to the Nerve Gear, Nerve Gear is a virtual
                  reality heltmet, the heltmet can sense all sorts of things such as height, weight and age of the player etc. At first Kirito does not look like his avatar inside of SAO until certain events happens, this is when everything starts to go down hill when he himself and also other players are transported to the main centre of the game, at this point the creator of SAO inside of game reappears, Akihiko Kayaba is this person. Before this has happen Kirito and his friend Klein notice that something is missing when they entered the menu system, the log out button is not there meaning themselves and the other players are unable to log out of SAO. So we go back to the centre of the SAO where the creator of SAO starts to discuss why they can not log out of the game. 
The only way to get out of the game is to reach to the 100th floor the tower that consists of 99 boss inside each floor and the 100th floor is where the final boss is remain, But there is a price, every time someone dies in the game dies in real life, this became a international problem in the outside world. The only way to survive is to train and level up the avatar. Making sure that there health does not reached to 0.
Kirito meets a girl called Asuna, they start to connect through out the arc and they effectually fell in love. Kirito went though different experience though out the time in SAO, loosing people who he had met inside of a guild. He met other people who are still alive.  Kirito who was chosen as one of the 1,000 beta testers. Since he had previous experience and knowledge of the game, he felt that he could beat the game easily. As a result, he set out to beat the game on his own.
The 2nd half is when Kirito has woken up from beating SAO game but Asuna has not woken up and this became a problem for him. He discovers that there is another virtual game Alfheim Online, Kirito looks at an image of Asuma trapped inside of ALO. By someone, not putting who.
People had has there doubts about the 2nd half of SAO, because it drag on quite a bit. But in my opinion I thought it was ok, not bad just ok.
The art style is splendid in my opinion, the voices fit the characters quite correctly. The OST is also splendid, I can't stop listening to it to this date.
I'm still new to reviews but I hoped this has help. I do apologise if I had put some spoilers and I got carried away as well.",8
"
                Sword Art Online simply does not deserve all the praise it gets. While the animation can be impressive, and the music was decent, the story was boring at best, hilariously bad in the middle, and horrifically offensive at it's worst. 
The main character, Kirito, is a wish fulfillment fantasy straight out of a fan fiction, who has no consistency personality, but is consistently idiotic and bad, and the show treats him like the second coming of Christ. His existence is solely to sell merchandise and the show's premise.
The other main character, Asuna, starts off decently, but is slowly turned from a strong, headstrong warrior into
                  a damsel in distress, and is put in the most horrific and disgusting scenes I've ever seen.
And speaking of those scenes (those who've seen the show know what I'm talking about), SAO is downright insulting in the way it handles rape. It uses such a disgusting act as fan-service, which is humiliating to the intelligence of the viewers.
SAO may have some good qualities, but they are outweighed by the stacks of crap it tries to pull off. The only enjoyment someone might get out of this is from hilariously bad it can get; I thoroughly enjoyed tearing every scene bit by bit. Be warned, though; for if you stare into the abyss, remember that the abyss stares at you, too.",1
"
SAO ( Sword Art Online ) directed by Itou, Tomohiko is without a doubt the best anime ever made. SAO is ranked #3 for popularity, with a Membership of 1,085,974 people strong. Clearly, the geniuses behind this worldwide phenomenon known as the SAO franchise are experts in script writing. This plain fact is undeniable as it is prominently explored throughout the franchise. The masterfully designed script and characters are evident, from the bland, cliche shounen protagonist named 'Kirito' all the way through to the action-packed Phantom bullet arc where our beloved protagonist Kirito delves into the new and never before seen anime concept of having
                  an over powered character fight in a thrilling tournament style setting. I could continue on with my discussion but i believe in the importance of letting people make decisions of their own accord, I do not wish to influence you, the reader any more than i already have. Ultimately without a doubt, all i can say is you have not been enlightened, you have not been truly happy, fulfilled or content with life. You have not stood at the gates of heaven and clicked play to engross yourself in the immense pleasure that is 'Sword Art Online'. 
Oh and if that wasn't enough to convince you to watch the amazing God given gift that is SAO than I believe Kirito gender bending as a female character in the sequel appropriately named 'Sword Art Online II' is enough to change any ignorant minds.",10
"
                A fair warning before I do my review, I try to be as objective as possible but it is very difficult as I am subjective, but very open-minded, when it comes to anime. This is also my first review so bear with me. Also forgive me if I compare a few other series, as that tends to be my base of comparison, however the comparisons tend to be very minor.
When I first heard of this series, It sounded like one of the best in terms of setting and story line, and frankly, it did not disappoint. I waited for the dub to be released on
                  Toonami to watch it so I had also heard plenty of criticism of the series before watching it, which I also kept in mind. Afterwords, I re-watched the entire series subbed about a week later.
The story of the series was amazing. While it was not on as large of a scale with something like Shingeki no Kyojin, it was able to keep me on the edge of my seat from episode to episode. A common criticism that I saw against the story was due to the lack of boss fights, since there are 100 floors in Aincrad, yet they only showed four boss fights. I definitely kept the series from getting boring as showing 100 fights would get very repetitive. Only a few are necessary to show. The same goes for the time skips.
The art was phenomenal, the action was amazing, and the setting was beautiful and diverse, in both Aincrad and Alfheim. The character designs were creative as well.
The sound, particularly the voice acting, was top-of-the-line. This goes for both the original Japanese dub and the English dub. The English dub specifically was extremely well done.
Okay, the big section; characters. One common criticism I had seen was that while the list of characters was diverse, there was a lack of development in almost all of them. I, for one, liked the fact that the series focused on the three main characters, Kirito, Asuna, and Suguha. While there were many more characters, I feel that they effectively acted as catalysts for the advancement of the story, but mainly I saw them as foils to the characters and mirrors to yourself. I definitely could relate to them at times, and see the contrast between the main characters and the supporting ones. I feel that the series didn't need a huge cast of fleshed-out characters to be amazing. It could do it with a few.
One of the few flaws I did see was in the second villain of the story. To avoid spoilers, all I can say is that he seemed very generic and cliche in terms of his motives, however his ultimate plan did make him seem very diabolical, as the power that he held gave him a lot of leverage.
I enjoyed the series immensely, as it hit my sweet spot for MMO's and my heart. I especially liked the direction it was taken, while I see many people did not. I personally preferred that it took the series in the direction of inter-personal relationships rather than pure action and a fight for survival, which would not fit well. The romance was especially great (yes, it is my favorite anime genre) and the series holds one of my favorite anime couples of all time, second only to Clannad.
Overall, the few flaws are vastly outweighed by its strengths. I personally think of this series as a masterpiece and my current third favorite series of all time.
If you read the entire review, I thank you for your time. Also, if based on my review and opinions you think I should read the light novels, message me on my profile because I'm still unsure as to whether they will appeal to me since I have only seen the anime.",10
"
                This is a good anime if you have nothing better to do. The story line is based loosely around Kirito and his adventures. The story was alright, trying to explain how Kirito overcame the challenge of getting out of SAO (Sword Art Online). However, the only characters we ever learn about is Kirito and Asuna. The rest of the characters are thrown aside and, maybe given one episode. So we never know the background of  these characters. The lack of growth in character makes me feel like this anime was never worth watching. It's sound and art was well thought out, making us (the
                  audience) feel like we were actually in a game. The action was well thought out as well, making many scenes were you just hold your breath, thinking about what will happen next. However, during the action, Kirito was Overpowered. Something that takes out 10 people, Kirito kills with a few damage done to him. Plus, he has dual skill, which no one else has. That makes him considerably stronger. That is what is so bad about this anime.
Furthermore, Kirito is a walking chick magnet. It seems like most of the side characters were girls, and Kirito ends up helping them. It is true that Kirito is loyal to Asuna, showing that he never falls in love with the other characters, but the other characters always end up falling in love with him. And half of them don't even look that old...",5
"
                What else can i say? This is probably my #1  most favorite anime of all time. Why? you ask, well for starters, I've been a huge player of the MMORPG Runescape for quite a while now and this anime just brought everything i have thought of that game into reality. This anime is designed so brilliantly and the story that the main character travels is one full of action, romance, and tearjerking moments. The excitement is also pretty awesome. Imagine yourself being trapped in a virtual world like Runescape and to get out, you must level up so that you can clear 100 floors
                  of monsters and bosses. Its just some stupid game right? No, unlike any game you have played before, this would be the most serious game in your life since if you die in the game, you also die in real life. 
(Don't worry i won't put any spoilers in my review) 
For Story, i gave it a 10/10.
Why? First of all, it shows how much one's life can mean whether in the real world or the virtual one. The romance in this anime is beyond amazing. To be able to fall in love in an virtual world and then to bring it to the real world is quite awesome. The main character's love is able to surpass many worlds. It really brings out the romance in this anime and the realization of how strong love can make us. Sword Art Online shows us that with love, we can do anything, even beyond the laws of the world. 
For Art and Sound i gave them both 10/10
The first Opening of SAO is just awesome. I would listen to it over and over again and memorize the lyrics. The clashing of the swords to the fizzling sounds of when things die is just so specific and precise that even if you don't like the storyline, its worth to watch it for the art and sound. The art itself is amazing. Asuna is so pretty!!! I love how they have made the details about all the things in this virtual world. I find that to be able to touch an area infront of you so that a menu can pop up is very amazing. 
Character Development i gave it also a 10/10
In this anime, they really develop the main characters attitude changes through out their time spent in the virtual game Sword Art Online. Kirito (the main character) shows so much changes in his life and he becomes a completely different person than he was back in the real world. Sword Art Online may have just been a game, but it really matured Kirito in every way. He learned to take responsibility in this ""game"". Not just responsibility, but also to protect his friends and those that he loves. Great character development in this anime, it really shows the changes to the character throughout his time trapped in Sword Art Online. 
Enjoyment: 10000000000/10 (10/10)
LOVED IT. Its awesome, fun, boss, and is a great anime for those that like a mixture of action and romance with a touch of fantasy. The openings are very catchy, and is a great adventure. As a gamer, this anime really shows things that have been pondering in my mind for a long time. Such a great show, i really hope for there to be a second season and even a third. Praying for it everyday. 
Overall - 10/10 
If you had read everything above you would know why i rate it a 10/10 overall. If you didn't and skipped to the bottom well let me sum it up for you: ITS AWESOME. Every part of this anime is great and funny. Despite having some minor flaws, it is everything a gamer/anime lover would want to watch. I greatly recommend it to you all who are even slightly interested in watching Sword Art Online. If your friends told you to watch it, then listen to their advice because this is seriously amazing. 
If you spent time to read through my review you have my biggest thanks and I hope all of you can come to have the same passion for this anime as I have. Anyways, thanks for reading!",10

                SAO is arguably the most popular of the virtual reality MMO genre that has been especially popular as of late.
It gets A LOT of hate because of this popularity, and a lot of people criticize it for not being as in-depth as other animes of the same genre, but all of that aside, it's a great show. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode of this show (yes, even the second arc which people would swear is the antichrist) and I would highly recommend it to anyone that isn't an elitist. It's not the second coming of Christ either, but it's a wonderful show that builds a
                  beautiful world full of fun characters.
Tl:dr - Don't listen to the hate. If you like anime and are an avid gamer, you'll love this show.",8
"
                Well this is my first review. As most of you know there are light novels for this series, all of which I have read. And this has been perhaps the best read I've had in ages. The storyline, characters, vastness of the world and romance between asuna and kirito are perfect, and the twists will leave you dying for more. If you're here for an anime with a great storyline, have played any rpgs or enjoy a little romance mixed with action and suspense, then this is the anime for you. Although there has only been 4 episodes (at the time of this review), the
                  anime has covered a substantial part of volume 2 in the sword art series, so from here on out the main and incredible storyline will be followed.
Animation & Audio: 10/10
The animation is beautiful to say the least, and will no doubt accurately represent the amazing setting from the light novels as well as the character models. The voice acting for the main characters Asuna and Kirito have been spot on (of course), and the sound quality is overall, like the animation, perfect.
Story & Characters: 10/10
As I hinted at above, the story will have you hooked from the beginning , I'm sure many of you have played rpgs, and if you died in those rpgs, you'd respawn and try again of course. But in this anime, the rpg becomes real life, if you health bar drops you're killed almost instantly in real life. With that kind of premise, this anime will be very suspenseful and engaging.
I'll focus on the main characters for now because most of the others haven't been fairly introduced yet. Off the bat you can tell Kirito isn't the average anime protagonist, he chooses to go solo for the sake of his own survival rather than stay with his ""noob"" friend and protecting him in the VRMMORPG. This might seem like a shortcoming, but in the novels he quickly changes upon meeting Asuna (his main love interest+party member), and becomes a character you'll love. Asuna is very strong willed and at first seems to contrast with the anti-social and awkward Kirito, but we later find out how similar they are, and their relationship is perhaps the best I've seen in any other anime or manga.
Overall/Rewatch Value: 10/10
This anime will only be about 25 or 26 episodes long, covering just volumes 1,2, and perhaps some of 8 in the process, if it does well enough movies and ovas or even another season could be launched, allowing us to further immerse in this incredible universe.
And I'm sure by the time this anime is finished (or long before), everyone will be rushing to read the novels, and they won't be disappointed!",10
"
                Man, this show is....interesting.  A little background-this was basically my first anime and i watched it when i was in middle school, so i thought it was pretty good but now...
Anyway, lets get to it!
Story (2)-  The story in this show SUCKS!!!  First 2 episodes are really cool, and you can easily see why so many ppl love it.  Then you get to the rest...which all follow one of three patterns: 1. kirito meets girl, kirito helps girl, girl falls for kirito, kirito leaves girl 2. kirito does something with asuna/they solve a mystery/they make out 3. last episode's plotline (which
                  still sucks).  Rlly this show has such a strong platform upon which it could have expanded SO MUCH MORE.  Like the whole idea of MMO's is so cool, they couldve just made a better story.  The whole thing with kirito being a chick magnet is to be expected honestly, but the fact that they made it to the point that even his sister likes him is unneccesary af.  The creator of the show obviously wanted to experiment with the different arcs so he decided to put them at difference intensity and grimness levels-first arc was VERY intense, and kinda grim, second arc was not intense and not grim(except the 2nd to last episode), third arc was kinda intense and VERY grim (the whole gun thing just seems creepy), and the fourth arc was just useless filler shit to try give asuna some character.  Honestly tho, there was something in all this crap that my middle school self liked, so i wont give it a 1.
Art (9)- great, amazing, best part of the anime
Sound (8)-also good
Character (1)-easily the worst part of the anime
Kirito-hes the main character, an overpowered little shit, chick-magnet, and the hero?  the anime hypes him up WAYYY too much, and automatically assumes after the first arc that everyone LOVES him, but we rlly dont.  hes extremely flat and static.  while he does go through some hardships, the kid mostly has life going good for him, he gets out of the game, gets tons of girls, free to chillax cause his parents dont give a crap about what he does.  now i get that he was lonely cause he found out his parents are rlly his aunt and uncle and sugu's rlly his cousing, but the fact that he is willing to go back to a concept that literally slaughtered 4k ppl is ridiculous.  apart from his video game obsession, he is happily married to asuna (yea this is all in game but they basically think the same way irl too).  the fact that the rest of the girls in the anime all CLING to him even tho hes clearly in a relationship and doesnt want them is sickening, everyone in the anime adores him but hes rlly an uninteresting character that i could care less about
Asuna-started out rlly intersting, because she seems pretty powerful and stuff, but then she gets lazy and leaves ALL the work to kirito.  honestly would rather have the first few arcs have her as the main character, but looking at mother's rosario....mmmmm maybe not.  she actually, unlike kirito, is a dynamic character, but the problem is that her personality GETS WORSE as the series goes on-she ends up become a classic waifu character that loves and treats EVERYONE with respect.  if you keep going in the series (despite how much it sucks) ull learn that shes pretty smart and good at almost all the stuff that she does.  for some reason the anime decides to completely cut her out of the main plot and give it all to kirito, despite knowing that she would make a MUCH better lead.  the fact that she acts like all the other girls trying to get kirito's attention is just sad, considering that she isnt even competing at this point.  i love how this anime sets her up to be that badass female character but ultimately decides to make her useless yet again like almost ALL female anime characters. what a shame
Suguha-definitely another interesting character that turns into yet another waifu character.  what sadly defines her in the plot is her attraction to kirito (yep theres incest too!).  lucky for her tho, im sparing her the hate for this, cause rlly i liked the ending to the subplot-she and kirito reach a mutual understanding and go back to the way things were.  yea that would be nice if it stayed that way but it doesnt, SHE ACTS LIKE ALL THE OTHER GIRLS.  What the F***.  Have you not learned your lesson girl?  He does not like you, nor will he EVER!!!  anyway, so she has this nerd boy at her school in love with her and TBH hes just as cute as kirito irl without the glasses.  instead of having a thing with that dude, she persists with kirito, despite knowing that it'll never work.  
Silica-she's honestly one of my fav characters, just cause of her character design.  now as for her actual personality....hmmmm...lets just say its horrible.  she is the second of our dumb kirito gets girl filler episodes, but one thing that caught me at the end: she says to pena ""the day i got my very own big brother""  that should mean they have a sibling relationship right? not romantic? WRONG  the anime decides to make her literally go back on what she said and continue wanting kirito.  wtf???  they could've had an actual quality relationship as siblings kindve but guess thats ruined. oh well
Lisbeth-tragic character, yet another one of kirito's fangirls.  the ending of her episode tore me apart.  i would be 100% fine with her episode if it wasnt the case that there would be 5 more replications of it.  then hers the best part-she stays loyal to kirito! haha wow u dumb girl.  ok moving on...
Klein-hes one of the only other male characters so props to the creators for putting him in!  rlly i got the perverted older brother feel from him, but rlly he doesnt have enough interactions (real interactions, seeing each other does NOT count) with kirito to support.  hes pretty shallow and i just didnt like him all that much so nah
Yui-honestly added in there to make the relationship between kirito and asuna less sexy and more familial.  shes rlly not that important in the overall scheme so ill hold off on the hate
Sinon-she rlly is a strong character, and i liked how the anime sort of matured with GGO, and brought more mature characters like her in.  her backstory is pretty dark but also makes her seem stronger than all the other girls in the show.  ik that she rlly does deserve a break from the craziness in ggo so she decides to do alo for a while, but she just turned into another one of kirito's fangirls.
Villain #1-  this dude is forgiven WAYYY too easily by kirito, almost to the point of them being friends?  hes a psycho and deserves to be treated like one
Villain #2-  a disgusting rapist who's point is to make life hell for the other characters.  the final scenes in alo are 10x more disturbing than the first arc's are, but for some reason the rest of the season is more lighthearted.  rlly hes obnoxious af, and the show took a weird turn with him
Agil-hes just...there
Enjoyment (6)-  even though this anime is a full MESS, it actually fits together in a way that satisfies ppl.  im judging the rest of the stuff harshly but its not to the point where its a pain to watch,  its actually pretty interesting.  defintiely good to watch during the christmas time cause it gives u this nice cozy feeling but anyway i think its okay with enjoyment
Overall (5)- its either u like it or u dont",5

                Okay, SAO is definitely a weird and unpredictable anime. The first episode wasn't as good as I expected, but I stuck with it to see where it led on. After 4 or 5 episode, I'm all in. The first Arc, SAO (that's the arc), is brilliant. The timeline's a bit too messy, and the character development is unstable. You think the anime's got one heroine, turns out, it's got X many. The story itself is great for SAO. The second arc, not so good. If I had a way to express it, it'll be ""Why? What is the point? Go die for wasting my time.""
                  
So, allow me to expand on what I mean, if you're still reading. It isn' the fact that the anime's good which motivates you to watch the latter 8 episodes. No, rather it is anticipation. The following may contain MINOR SPOILER!!!!!!!
When Asuna is violated by that wanker of pussies, I got really angry. I've liked her since the start. And seeing her development through the series, you can't help but feel a bit attached. So when some dickhead starts to play villain, well, you can guess what happened. The producers tried to weave in another relationship in the second arc, but, the anticipation residing in you makes you skim that part. So you really have little idea what's going on. 
So apart from the second, useless and dispicable arc, it's a good anime. Yes, it did finish happily. But the ending's a bit... big bang-less. So unless you're a person with a cold heart, or someone who likes to be tortured, this anime's good. Otherwise, you'll have a boner all the time. 
BTW, this is the only anime where I've got to know the ending, midway through, so I won't have a heart attack from stress and anger. I think that shows how much I wanna watch it. Like seriously, its THAT much.",10

                Sword Art Online was surprisingly successful here in germany. 
Everyone urged me to watch this so I did and my thoughts afterwards were: yeah it's okay but why are you guys all going bat shit crazy about this anime? 
Me personally I don't get it.
Story (5) !!!SPOILER ALERT!!!
I admit, the first two episodes build up a huge potential. But I had to realize that they did not seem to be willing to use any of that potential at all.
They just present you irrelevant side-kicks which they kill off pretty soon.
The story is so fast paced that you don't even have time to like any of
                  it. 
All happens so fast that i found it hard to care about anything that was going on.
If they would have kept it down a bit, maybe SAO would have been a great anime. But like this it is almost inevitable that all those plot holes and deus ex macchina moments show up. 
Art (9) : Yes the anime looks great. They did a great job and really tried to compete among other AAA titles and they created some pretty awesome pictures. The beautiful images created were one of the few things that kept me going throughout season 1. 
Sound (9) : Great job here as well. Nothing to bitch about.
Character (6): Like I said. Due to the fast pace of the anime I didn't even have time to like any of the characters and even if I did they were killed off anyway before I knew anything about them. 
Enjoyment (6): Since they didn't really develop the characters, made me rush through way too compact storylines, there was nothing to enjoy except for the well done fighting scenes.
This anime clearly was not for me. If you like very fast paced stories and don't care that much about detail give it a go. You will enjoy the fighting scenes and maybe one or two major reveals.
If you are looking for a complex story and interesting characters, move on to a different anime, there is nothing to see here.",6

                Sword Art Online is about players getting trapped into a game, if a player reaches game over not only do they die in the game but they die in real life.  The year is 2022, Kirigaya Kazuto (Kirito) is the mean protagonist for this series.  It's basically about him trying to clear the game as a solo player.
Story 7-  The first episode captivated me.  I was so into the first episode only to find out that the next few episodes were trash.  Almost complete trash.  I read the Light Novel for SAO and I loved it.  I realized
                  the first few eps were following the second volume of the light novel which had almost nothing to do with the main story.  The main story starts around ep 5 or 6 and it was rushed way too fucking fast.  I was so pissed off at the anime.  It honestly was just so cliche.  I think I'm just being bias because I read the LN but it felt like the scenes weren't really played out well.  The story was really inconsistent throughout the series.  You see one character one episode and then you dont see them again until the very end of the series.  I took a chance to watch this anime a second time around and realized how terrible it was.  There are two arcs to the series...the first arc was good but it was way too rushed and it felt like you were missing a lot of things you should've known through the series and the second arc is just what the fuck.  The second was really disappointing.  Again comparing it to the LN it sucked DICK.  Anyway if it weren't for the LN then the story would have gotten a 4 or 5 because there is just so much information missing in the anime.
Art 7- I'm not really good at rating art but SAO's art wasn't anything to special unless you watch your anime in 1080p (now that's some good ass quality)  I felt like the art was just your average anime art.  I could compare this art to Angel Beats or Guilty Crown.  even though Accel World is the sister of this anime I wouldn't compare SAO to it because both their works are very different.
Sound 10- For some reason I really enjoyed the openings for both arcs of the anime.  I loved them so much I learned for openings on the piano.  Again I'm not really good at rating stuff like this I feel like sound should be in the same section as art lol. 
Character 6-  Man.  No character development.  AT ALL.  Kirito's character is so boring.  He never changes his mood.  It's always survive to fight to I want to see Asuna, eventually becoming I have to save Asuna (Asuna being the main female protagonist of the first arc)  I guess his character develops a little when he has to save her and stuff like that but seriously.  It's always the shit shit.  AND ASUNA'S CHARACTER what the fuck...she just sits there taking the shit thats thrown to her (well its not like she can do anything anyway) but still she wasn't hurt or anything like that.  I found it surprising that none of the characters were traumatized from a event that occurred for a long time.  These characters are ridiculous. 
Enjoyment 7- I really enjoyed SAO the first time around but the second time I noticed a bunch of flaws in the anime again comparing to the LN.  The main reason why I enjoyed the anime is because I really enjoyed the LN.  The first time I didn't realize that the anime had so many holes because I read the LN and disregarded all of the things that made sense.  and again if it weren't for the LN then my enjoyment level would go down significantly.
Overall 7-  I think this deserves a 7.  I don't really give low scores and I suck at reviewing (still new to the reviewing stuff) For all you LN readers I know or at least hope you appreciate this anime because it honestly is a good story.  The story wasn't told well through the anime though.  What I'm trying to say is real the light novel.  It's better than the anime.
oh forgot to mention, the fight scenes in the anime are pretty badass.",7
"
                 when someone recommends SAO you hear the usual SAO first arc  was good  and the anime went downhill in the second arc yea it definitely got worse . but SAO was a failure from the beginning. 
story :3 
sword art online started good in the first episode. people are trapped in a virtual game and you need to complete 100  floors to win. now you might think this a cool plot and that this story will be a long journey where our MC survive in a cold blooded game. but we get the complete opposite of that. Ep 2 time skip
                  our MC is at level 20 and 2000 people died in boss battle and no one managed to pass the first floor. kirito (MC) defeat first floor boss and says some cringey lines that the author thought would make him look cool but ended up making him look stupid and time skip kizito joined a guild and at level 35. his guild members die then he decides to play solo. time skip MC at floor 50 .MC meets unimportant side character and guess what he is known as the black swordsman. but why? we the audience  rarely saw him in a battle. how can the author expects us to take him seriously? and how did he get that strong? of course because of the time skips we didn’t get to see any character development. and another time skip kirito is with asuna . time skip two years have passed kirito at floor 74.?? the awful time skips leads to no suspense or intense scenes because we already know our MC is strong enough and nothing is gonna happen to him or to the other characters because he is always gonna show up to save the day all in all, SAO is poorly written , rushed and has no interesting events. Truly a waste of  great concept 
 characters :1
 kirito: has no personality since we didn’t get to see any character development . he is just very strong that he could defeat all his enemies and never fails. also his character design is awful. typically, from character designs you get an impression of what that character is like . the only impression I got that he is weak and very childish. his character design could have been better. 
asuna: she is introduced as a strong character but we don’t get to see her strong side at all but you know what she is good at cooking .She cooks for the MC and fell in love with him when they hardly know each other . her character went downhill when they tried to made her clingy to kizito .  she was ready to give up on her title as the vice commander and leave the guild just so she could party with kirito when she was literally convincing him to join her guild. this speaks volumes on her character. her relationship with kirito was cringeworthy . kirito-kun i want to protect you .. asuna your handmade sandwich is great. asuna my life is yours. Asuna please cook for me . Ausna let’s stay together. that’s literally their dialogue throughout the series .overall this anime fails to build on its characters 
art:8 
great visuals 
sound :7 
good sound effects and voice acting. wasn’t a fan of the ost though 
enjoyment :4 
some might find it enjoyable. depends on your taste
 overall:3 
A train wreck",3

                I have never read the light novel of this Anime, When I watched it, I really liked the plot as it is one that I have never seen in other Anime(s) to date. I also play a various amount of video games, so the setting and how characters were animated appealed to me quite easily. The characters were two good looking teenagers that anyone would love to continue watching. They were also strong, when some Anime, the main characters are absolutely useless and rely too much on other people. This makes their independence more outstanding. And when they work together, they achieve greater power. 
The
                  Second Half/Ending of this Anime was a slight disappointment to me when I was really hooked onto this series. Just a personal opinion here",9
"
                The anime that has such a love-hate relationship with the fanbase. Some people swear that this is one of the best anime to ever have come out, others just hate the entire series. I'll do my very best to provide as unbiased a review to this as possible, however late it is. 
10,000 players find themselves stuck inside a virtual reality MMO, created by the antagonist Kayaba Akihiko. Among those stuck inside is our hero, who goes by the gamer-tag of Kirito, and his love interest, Asuna. 
Halfway through the arc, they find themselves solving the mystery of Sword Art Online, but there's more. Asuna
                  changes her whole character, from being the femme fatale of the series, becomes the damsel in distress, all for the sake of progressing the story forward. It's absolutely insulting to her character. Just to rub salt on the wound, the antagonist that drives the latter half of the story is an abusive rapist type character who pulls no punches in showing how bad he is. Because we all need a bad guy we can hate, right? 
The qualm that almost every hater of SAO has (myself included) was that the story had so much potential. Instead of the absolutely sickening harem route that the author took, he could have built the world of Sword Art Online into a dark and gritty world, all the while building a romance between the two MCs. That would have definitely taken the story into a much better direction than where it is currently. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't quite sum up the story. Kirito, being the typical badass anime protagonist, isn't quite satisfied with one girl. The author feels the need to add the stereotypical friendzone-girl, the loli, the incest, all into the mix just to prove how much of a man Kirito is. 
Halfway through the Alfheim arc, I was wondering why the series I actually liked turned into such a shitty and generic harem story. Why? You had so much potential! I desperately wanted to like it, but it kept leaving a bad taste in my mouth. 
With the advent of the second season, focusing on another new MMO, to tack on another ""cool"" detective aspect to Kirito, not to mention add the ""cool"" archer girl to his harem. 
I so desperately want to like this anime, but with the direction it went, I really don't have any choice. The author keeps moving from world to world without any intention of actually building a world to it's full potential. For all of this, I have to give this series a 4/10",4
"
                I have to say that I was very enchanted by the idea of people being in a virtual world where they could do nearly anything they imagined within the scope of a game. Swordplay, magic spells, even cooking skills... this is a fantasy that a lot of people dream about. Of course, being stuck in it due to unforeseen circumstances is not entirely new. Nevertheless, it wasn't something I'd watched before, so it was exciting for me. And who doesn't enjoy good versus evil? Also, this series wasn't just about clearing the game. It was also about the use of mind-altering technology for entertainment, what
                  drives people to develop it and why people use it. Where is the line between the virtual world and reality?
The first arc of the show was not very well executed. There is a plot, but it is rushed and there are time skips between the episodes. The first few seemed to be filler pieces. It was a little disorienting to me until I realized what was happening. At first I thought that I had skipped an episode by mistake, but I suppose that a little time skipping is necessary given the nature of the conflict. However, I would have very much enjoyed it if it were spread out a little more as it would have helped with character development and let the viewers see more of the online world. I still liked the story nonetheless.
I was deeply impressed with the animation, and even the characters remarked how beautiful Aincrad and Alfheim were in their eyes. I frequently stopped to take screenshots. Scenery and backgrounds are colored in lovely tones and have shadows which make them appear realistic. They honestly made me want to use NerveGear for a few moments. In addition, the characters were brightly colored and therefore uniquely distinguishable.
Before watching SAO, I knew I would love the soundtrack because I had heard some of it on Youtube. Yuki Kajiura is one of my favorite composers of all time and she never fails to amaze me. The music is extraordinary and captured the emotions of all scenes and characters perfectly. You could feel sadness, happiness, hope, and even the dread of battle. As good as the soundtrack was, though, I did find sometimes that it was too good, if that makes sense. For example, if she had composed a good sad piece for a particular moment, it was great, but that particular scene was not that sad, so it seemed to exaggerate feelings. Kajiura is a composer that really knows how feelings sound like, so some of it might have been off balance for me because the plot had fallen through, though that is my opinion.
Ah, the famed Kirito. I myself enjoyed his character, a shy young man who doesn't do much in the real world but has a strong presence in the virtual one. He comes off as calm, cool, and collected until he or someone he loves is in danger. I found when he had shocked expressions, they made a huge contrast with his usual nonchalant face. But otherwise, he is very powerful and I could see why people could hate that sort of strength. However, I feel that the way he is portrayed in the first episode explains his power well enough and he does experience character development in the series. He becomes aware of the similarities of his life online and in the real world, discovering his identity and the way the world works.
Although Asuna is also a strong fighter, pretty, looks delicate, and is fast with her sword, I didn't like her as much as I liked Kirito. Her first interactions with Kirito marks her as a bit of a tsundere, but as she gets to know him she becomes warmer, though the two do bicker every once in a while. 
There are a few reoccurring characters, most of which I found likable. The others that appeared for only one episode, mainly the girls that fell in love with Kirito, were not so impressive to me because of that fact. A one episode love at first sight is really not my thing.
Now, a lot of people either think SAO is the greatest anime ever or is the worst, and I'm inclined to say that it is good, but not the best. I did enjoy the way the story went even though it was a little rough, and there were some particular elements that I did not like. (There is that lack of clear development for the relationship between Asuna and Kirito, for example. They suddenly came to like each other and I wasn't exactly sure why, at least on Kirito's part, since he seemed so solitary.) My like for the world of SAO made up for it, though, and that was enough. The animation and soundtrack are gorgeous, characters are fine, and sometimes I watched two episodes instead of one each night because I was eager to see the next part.
Final verdict: is this garbage? No. Is it super amazing? In some ways, yeah, but others, it isn't. Would I recommend it? To some people, I would. Would I watch it again? I have one or two favorite episodes of the lot, but otherwise I don't think I would watch the whole thing again. It wouldn't be torture to do so, though. So, 8/10.
Oh, yes, this is rated 13+ for a reason. Even if there isn't much bloodshed, virtual violence is still violence. Looks like it would hurt a lot. Plus there is a particular scene in the penultimate episode of the season that could be very inappropriate for children.",8

                PROS :
- Very unique Sci-Fi concept of anime where it introduces Futuristic Fully-Dived VRMMORPG to the viewer 
- Different pressure where you can die for real in games instead respawing
- Good - Average story
- Great art, animation, music, and voice actor
- Fairly good MC
- Lovely MC's girlfriend and they make lovely couple too
- Lovely MC's little sister
- Good supporting characters
- Packed with action, commedy, romance, drama, as well as common things you found everyday in common MMORPG games like cheater, quest, guild, etc- Good - Average Villain
CONS : 
- Most of the episodes are similiar to Filler Episodes in other anime, I know that its the part of the LN but to be honest it is not essential to story
- Overpowered MC which makes the game look easy on him
- Somehow the ending for the first world (Aincrad) wasn't clear to me, anyone feeling the same ?
- Some incest scene, although I don't really know if that counted as incest or not",8

                There is a myriad of reviews for this anime both online and offline. There also seems to be sometimes a big three-esque stereotype of people either loving or hating this anime. I personally don't see why, but that's just what some people feel. There's nothing wrong with that, but this anime is neither a devil spawn or god in the anime world.
--Review:
I'm going to try to shorten this review as much as I can. Sword Art Online by Kawahara, Reki was a great fun story to read, but the anime was only about average at best. The main reason why this is because it tries
                  to follow the light novel as much as possible, but in doing so made it extremely predictable, therefore hurting the excitement factor. There are other things about this anime that really hurts it as a whole are gaping plot holes, poorly transitioned love story, lack of character development, etc. Even so, those factors don't make this a terrible or even bad anime.
The best thing about this anime is its ability to make you feel emotions at almost any point of the anime, making you feel connected to them. Since, all the back stories in Sword Art Online have a purpose as to why they were put in. They tell about all the hardships people went through that blasted game. It really hits home, and it made the anime worth watching. 
Among other things this anime has to offer that is good are its the action sequences. Watching those duels in Sword Art Online were gorgeous. Seeing flickering sparks flying off the swords as they clashed, the glowing lights that came off their weapons when they were about to do some sword skill, were magnificent to watch. They aren't the best action scenes I have ever seen, but they are pretty to look at.
Is Sword Art Online worth the watch? Yes and No. If you enjoy watching some drama, or romance with some action sprinkled in between then this is worth watching. It has some great romance, and tear-jerking moments. Probably making it hard to put down for lovers of that genre. On the other hand, if you don't like that particular genre or only want to watch for the action. Well, you are going to get disappointed. The action is few and far between, and nothing about this anime is going to change your mind to make you love the romance/drama anime scene. 
Overall, Sword Art Online is average. Nothing spectacular, but nothing horrific. I personally enjoyed it, and am eagerly awaiting for the Gun Gale Online arch and Alicization Arc that are hopefully in the works.",7
"
                To be honest, the story was good for the first episode but not the rest. The characters would only be shown for 1 or 2 episodes. The characters should've been shown for atleast 4 or 5 episodes. Episode 25 was good except for the part when Kirito and Sugou fought irl. That showed that Kirito is a Mary-Sue. Kirito is shown to be handsome and is extremely skilled. He gets over-powered ALL THE TIME when he fights. Girls in VRMMORPG fall in love with him. Asuna is shown to be a Mary Sue because she is cute but also skilled. Men fall in love with
                  her, shes a good cook and has absolutely NO flaws which makes her really annoying.",7

                *English is NOT my first language! This review will be edited... eventually!*
Sword Art Online. Loved by many, hated by just as many. Hyped from the day one, and thus being praised as one of the best animes of all time... or, atleast, of this season. As a luck would have it, I wasn't part of that hype. My previous experiences with a... lets say, similarly overhyped titles, tought me a good and faluable lesson to sit back and wait, wheter or not the hype would wear off, as the time passes . And what do you know... it did. Majorly!
And yet, somehow, I wasn't prepared
                  for it! Even though I managed to save myself from the flaming hype-storm, and was pretty much the last one to ever see SAO from the beginning to the end, it still somehow managed to take me by surprise, by how horribly dissapointing it was... and I WAS warned in advance!
Sword Art Online, was a mental battle, unlike any other that I've seen since my DBZ-reviewing days! With a solid and interesting beginning premise, abysmally mediocre story, horribly unsatisfying ending, and disapointingly boring characters, SAO is a equivalent example of a show, done horribly wrong! A sad yet unfulfilling example of crippleling lazines, that should never be given as much of attention, as it so unfortunately often times receives. 
Story (3)
The story itself, is almost so basic and simple, that I would almost be tempted to call it ""ABC of Fanfiction""! Start with a strong and interesting premise, sully it with pointless exposition and boring bantering, and then just... end it! End it, by pissing to the wind! 
And the people, still affected by the hype, were the ones to say, that the story was deffinetly the best part of SAO! 
Wow! Really, people! Really?! This, is good ENOUGH, for a story?! This?!
Clearly, there's miscommunication between me, and the ""best story ever made, ever""- title, because all I can see, is just some jumbled bits and pieces of that said ""story"" here and there, randomly scattered allwhere and everywhere, where they would soon be drowned in a sea of melodrama and amazingly superior musical score!
But, let's not be overly critical here, just for the sake of it shall we? 
The beginging is indeed interesting enough - atleast, for me - to keep me glued in my anime-watching- position for about... ten... twelve episodes, at tops, when the story seems to be rolling... quite nicely. The world seems interesting... altough, a bit generic, messy and boring, in most parts, but there are - literaly! - some hidden gems in here and there, so it doesn't feel that bad... for that ten to twelve episodes, that is! But, after that magical point, when the story starts to lose focus, and it's all about just some random game-battles, escort-missions with teen-lolies, or characters just blabering on and on about some pointless gaming terms to one another, it all just... fell down to its face, with no splender, or dignity! The story literaly just stopped, and it seemed to have no interest to move forward  god knows for how long, until it suddenly just jumped into its conclusion, and pissed me off with a promises of a second season! 
If you've ever played any RPG's, or games in general... and if you know anything about fantasy/harem-genres - seriously, just look at the poster! - you will know, where this story is going, from the very start! No big surprises, and absolutely no actual creative thinking needed, from the outside of the freaking clishe-box!
""This one guy plays this game - he becomes uber-good at it! So good, that he becomes famous inside the game... for some reason - because he's edgy, emo, and... solo! Bunch of girls appear in front of him, with some boring side quests for him, and thus instantly fall in love with him... because for a reason! Then stuff happens, and then, the ending!""
It's like every MOE-game ever created! Tropped in a medieval setting! And not even that good setting, in fact! There's nothing but villages, forests or flower fields - boring!
This story was not worth of my time. It's not worth anyones time. It was tedious, boring, pointless, and deffinetly... not worth the hype it got when first aired! I could count for atleast hundred other animes, with better story, than SAO... but why bother?! Overrated Hype is after all even bigger/badder Boss, than the Nostalgia Goggles, so... no point for me dying, by hanging myself on that cross!
Art (6)
The art style isn't really anything, that I haven't seen done before - it's generic. It's doesn't have that ""so good it makes me piss myself!""- sort of quality, but atleast it's clean, nice to look at, and without any major hicbums... hicups! Both the magical bums... elements, and the elements of nature are actually done pretty shapely... well, and especially the sunlight was always such a arse-candy... a treat, for my eyes that I was almost drooling on my keaboard! (All those bums...!)
That being said, the character designs, nor the levels of the game, aren't really something to get all overly exited about! Or... maybe, the arses...
The characters are blander than bland, the most cookey-cuttered, the most basic ""japanese"" heroes, that you could ever think of, or find - young boy, black hear, dark eyes... blah! - and the levels of the SAO-game are just as variable as most of the Amnesia- custom story- levels! Nice fields of flowers everywhere... even nicer forests and village-sets, apparently stolen from some kind of team park... that went broke! 
So, yeah... Even though I normally never mention my legit opinions about the arts or music, this time, I have to mention the art as one of the view saving graces for this anime... because, believe me... this one desperately needs it!
Sound (9)
Speaking of sounds... the music in SAO is absolutely beautiful! Truly... this must be one of the most beautifully made soundtracks, that I've heard in a long time!
SAO's soundtrack has everything, that a good show could ever need. It's soothing, when it's needed, it's fast and energetic when needed, and it's sad, and emotional, when needed. It's almost too perfect to be excluded with SAO, but to be fair... this soundtrack was in the end the only reason why I even bothered to care some of the scenes, in the last third of the show.
I do admit... sometimes, such overally melodramatic scores may come just a tiny bit cheap ways to bring out emotions and weight in a situtations where there never really isn't... any... but atleast one of these scores brought tears in my eyes - on it's own, without any cheap deaths added! - so it gets a pass from me, this time, as a saving grace. 
Characters (2)
THEY SUCK!!!
Okey, so... that was blunt. 
No, really! They do suck! 
The main hero of ours is so OP, bland and annoying, that I would rather eat paint than call him even a character! I've heard many times, that Kirito is nothing but a archetypical wish fulfillment- character, and I couldn't agree more! Everything he wants, he gets! Everything he tries to do, he can... even if no one else can't, and with no actual effort, but just... deciding he wants to do it! With such a thick plot-armor, he never makes any major mistakes, or suffer any losses... because he is the famous Kirito - god of SAO!
Asuna isn't really any better. She's just some mediocre tsundere, with swords... and she cooks. That's it! There's nothing else in her, that would make her even a character! But, because SAO is clearly a harem/hentai-simulator, she also bends on top of the tables, gets groped by tentacle-monsters... gets almost raped in a bird cage... and actually is the one, that has sex with the main hero, so... Whait! Was there supposed to be a compliment in there, somewhere?
The villain of this turd, is still by far even worse, than... no, whait! There are actually... two, no, three villains! First, there's Kayaba, who programmed SAO, and turned harmless RPG, into a horrible, virtual-reality death-trap! He's pointless - he doesn't even remember, why he did all this, in the first place!
Secondly, theres this... Fairy King Oberon - oh, brother! - who kidnaps Asuna, locks her up in a cade, and ever-so gentlemanly, rapes her in submission... with marriage! He's pointless - he gets bitch-slapped and... cries? Idk...
Thirdly, there is this murdering quilt called the Laughing Coffin. They do nothing.
Who did I miss... Oh, yeah! All those booby-girls, who won't get to sleep with Kirito! Yeah... they're pointless, too.
And what's even worse, is that all the character development that happens, or doesn't happen, is based upon Kirito... because his harem is pretty much the only part of the cast, that gets any legit screen time! All they talk about, is Kirito. All they ever think about, is Kirito! But do they really change, grow or develope, as a characters because of this... constant hormonal obsession? No! Does Kirito ever change, grow or develope, because of his ever-expanding harem? Nope! He just stays the same, because he's so awesome that way!
Bo-f*cking-ring!
Enjoyment (4)
First, it was interesting. Then, it became fun. Then it was boring. Then pointless. Then stupid. Then boring, again! Then, there were bums... No!
It's like, the writers really did tried to give us something worth while, then went all ""f*ck off"", and decided to just wing it, since it already became so popular... apparently by merits beyond my comprehention. I still would've been totally fine with it, if the whole show itself was all about this mystery... how far, or how low humanity can really go in order to survive, and is make-believe world actually a better option for some, than the reality? 
And what about the conclusion, then?! 
What was Kayabas' intention for all of this - to make a point... to dick around, or just play god in his own world? Spoilers - we will never know!
I didn't want to see Kirito, running around with his harem! I didn't want any forced romance between him, and Asuna! I didn't want a villain, who can't even remember his own motives! I didn't want to see underaged girls being groped and sexually abused - I have my own sites for that!
When I can only enjoy a show, purely because of it's graphics and music, then believe you me, there's deffinetly something wrong! Horribly wrong!
Overall (4)
Sword Art Online, is a hot, steaming, overhyped and overrated mess, that I for once, can't bring myself to absolutely hate... unlike, many other titles, with similar crosses to bear!
The show just didn't live up to it's full potential. In my eye, it just had too many problems to overcome, and not nearly enough time, skill, nor interest to make an effort to improve things it needed to. 
Give us full and inventive story to follow - not just some shallow and bland harem/escort mission- simulation! Give us some interesting and complex characters - not these talking dolls with swords glued up in their arms! Give me a world, that's unlike any other that I've ever seen - not this mediocre medieval village-community, that I could've come up after lobotomy!
Overally... there are better things out there. A lot better things! I do see, why this show became so popular, but even though I did not like it, I'm not entirely one of the haters, either. Sword Art Online is... harmles, to say the least. It's deffinetly not something, that I would watch ever again, but luckily... there's always an Abridged series!",4

                Sword Art Online may be one of the newest anime that has the chance to become part of a new big 3. There has been a couple of ""Big 3's"" throughout the years. It started off with Fist of the North Star and DragonBall and the original Gundam. Then into Slayers, DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho. Later anime presented itself to kids and out came Yu-Gi-Oh and pokemon and Digimon. Then finally now the big three is Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach and their popularity is starting to fade. Will Sword Art Online ever belong in a Big Three? If they get their act together
                  because the show has potential. 
Story- The story is one of the most original stories I have ever witnessed. Everything in the story can lead to something unexpected. They are all in a game world where you can only leave if you beat the boss at the end of level 100. That literally could span 60+ episodes but there is the problem with the story. If you have a problem with pacing, you are going to be very unhappy with this anime. Everything happens so fast and frankly the whole show could have done without the last arc. If Sword Art Online were to put more episodes about the actual Sword Art Online and forget about the last arc the show would have been a million times better. They rushed everything and in the last arc there is a creepy character who likes a family member more than just a family member, if you catch my drift. They really did underutilize the story.
Art- Although the story was really ""meh"" the art was fantastic. If you like bright vibrant colors that explode in your face as you go into the new world Kirito leads you on you are going to enjoy this anime quite a lot, well maybe just the scenery...
Sound- The soundtracks are pretty decent just average. The openings were not that bad but they are definitely not the best and avoid the ending songs in my opinion. They were not that catchy to me but if you want to give it a try by all means go ahead. I watched this in Dub and I give this show credit, the Dub is really really good. I don't know anything about the way the Sub sounds but it's really all about preference. 
Character- This is where the lack of pacing affects the rest of the story. There is character development with only ONE character. The villains were so superbly creepy and menacing until the first one reveals his motives which leaves you scratching your head. There are many cool characters that deserve time to shine but you barley get to see them. Very disappointing. 
In the end I enjoyed it to a certain degree. It has a lot of flaws but a lot of promise. If you are uncertain whether you want to watch it or not I must say give it a try. Even if it's not awesome it's still got the right stuff to make you keep wondering what's next. There is a season 2 coming out this year so all my hopes are in it learning from the mistakes of season 1. But in the end I give it a 6. Not the best, Not the worst, has cool fights, cool enemies amazing art and a lack luster pacing but do give it a try because I have a feeling season 2 will knock everybody's socks off and you gotta start somewhere. Who knows, maybe it will join animes like Fairy Tail and HunterXHunter in the newest edition of a Big 3.",6

                (Some spoiler) SWORD ART ONLINE what to say, its a good anime to watch if you just started or like the plot.
Plot/story- it had a good plot, game gone deadly there's not much anime like that except log horizon but there's always two anime alike (my opinion). Anyway back to SAO the reason I gave it (8) was because even though the plot was cool and can be related to most viewers but the main problem for many was the second part after episode 14, I mean I would of been happy if SAO ended there but they had to add another game thinking it
                  would have some kind of effect like in SAO (game) but personally I didn't like it. The addition of magic was kind of a sell out because nearly every MMORPG has magic but Sword art online didn't, which made this interesting. Another thing that ruined the second part of SAO was the seriousness and the removal of the deadliness, in ALO no one should be that serious about its just a game and I understood why Kirito took things seriously was because he was STUCK IN A DEATH GAME FOR TWO YEARS so none of them should take this game serious. Speaking of death game the I didn't like the fact that they took out the you will die if you die here situation, what I mean is that they took out the killer boss fights and the and the overall theme that was in the first part of SAO which was partly well mostly the reason why I watched it.
Characters- the characters were great, well for the first part I mean they all had different characteristics and personality but I didn't like most well pretty much all the characters from Episode 15 onwards.
Art- The art was just a bit over average it was cool how the environment should have looked if a advance game would have been developed and when it becomes a view from the player it shows what they are seeing which is pretty cool.
Sound- no problem with sound it played the right kind of music for each scene for example boss fight would have a serious adrenaline pumping music where in strolls around towns have a peaceful cheerful sound.
Enjoyment- I enjoyed it even though someone should of told me about the second part a years ago but i recommend anyone to watch it up until episode 14 but if your like me you want to watch every episode.
Thanks to anyone if you read the whole thing, sorry for any terms that aren't right but watched SAO a long time ago
And please comment since this is my first full review and sorry for not using a lot of punctuation I was not bothered to edit my work, thank you.",8

                Contains minor spoilers. 
This review is only based on the first 15 episodes, the rest is garbage. This show really sparked my love for anime, while I was trying to get into anime.
Story: In the near future, Virtual Reality MMORPG are the starting to come out. MC was a beta tester for Sword Art Online, which during the first release, the players are unable to log out and then if they die in the game, they die in real life. So now the objective for them is to clear all 100 floors so they can beat the game and log out.
Art: This show has a
                  lot of good fight scenes, the artwork I think is well done. 
Sound: English subbed is better than dubbed. While watching it in English dubbed, Kirito (MC) comes off as a douchebag. Probably just lost in translation, but in Japanese the character interactions are more natural.
Characters: Kirito and Asuna are my favorite duo. This is just based off the first 15 episodes since after that they butcher Asuna's character. Their chemistry is natural and amazing. There is a legitimate concern for them while they are trapped in the death game. There are times where I sat at the edge of my seat wondering how everything would work out.
Enjoyment: I rewatch the first 15 episodes on a regular basis. About every 3 months or when I am stuck inbetween shows. But I swear after episode 15, it  isn't worth watching. 
Overall: The show was mind blowing, absolutely amazing and then it gets butchered. It sucks, they could have ran the show for 50 episodes just on the death game and I would have gladly watched it. But leave it to the makers of SAO to butcher everything they make after about 20 episodes. They go off on random ass plot tangents that add nothing to the story or characters.",8

                Have you ever gone to a buffet? The place overflowed with a variety of food where you could pick whatever you want to eat and take as many as you want provided that you consume them all within your time limit. Be honest, not everything you picked tastes “good”. Sometimes it tastes like soggy french fries you get from lazy fast food restaurants despite its alluring appearance and fragrant smell. I think Sword Art Online’s the same. You experience many things - both good and bad along with bad hidden in good and good hidden in bad. 
The sense of unpredictability and ups and downs
                  caused by the sheer messiness of the story makes this show one of the finest, convenient time consuming series which is actually worth your time if you actually don’t mind genericity.
I’m too lazy to write now so I’ll just finish it here. Uhh.. Watch SAO if you think you like isekai, RPG, edginess and harem. You’ll probably be fine if you like them all. If you don’t however, then SAO might be a bit of a yikes for you. Still, there’s this thing called “Alicization” which is pretty much the better version of SAO so if you can somehow pass all the messiness and reach Alicization then it might just be worth it.",10
"
                I don’t really like going into an anime that can split a crowd of fans in two. I usually hope that the anime will be good, or just pleasant to watch, I really don’t mind if the show isn’t brilliant...Sword Art Online is one of these series, and I’ve never started a show as reluctantly as I did with this one.
STORY
The story of Sword Art Online, or SAO for short, follows online game enthusiast Kazuto Kirigaya, as he plays a virtual online role-playing game, called Sword Art Online. This new game has a twist however; if you die in the game, you die in real
                  life, and there is no exit. The only way to escape is to beat the game itself.
As a fan of RPG’s, I think the setting is one of the best I’ve seen in anime. ‘Kirito’ must now beat all of the game bosses to finish the game and save everyone. It’s a simple, yet effective setting, it has a great first few episodes which can really glue you to the screen. 
Unfortunately, this doesn’t last forever, as there are huge time gaps, and I don’t meant a few days but MONTHS, which made it feel like you’re skipping three or four episodes. This then feels like you need to think really hard about what have our characters gone through, and catch up[ to whatever is going on. The plot itself starts to lose the excellent structure it made in the first few episodes, at about a quarter of the way into the show. I have to blame the original material though, as I heard that the light novels were written quite badly.
The side plots aren’t so impressive either, they’re just full of Kirito’s hunt for gir...uhhh...equipment. Yeah. Swords and armour...
CHARACTERS
Okay. The characters are the worst part of this anime. They aren’t the worst cast I’ve ever seen but they are definitely in the bottom 10 on my list. They  just made the show worse, in my opinion.
If the creators just focused on the main plot of beating the game, and maybe filled in the giant episode gaps, instead of introducing us to lousy characters, the show would have been better.
But what about the main two?
Kirito plays the role of the perfect teenager. Strong, good-looking and yes, capable of fighting by himself most of the time, yet for the first half of the show he also comes across as being utterly useless, as he can’t save his colleagues in a tough fight.
Asuna starts off as an interesting character, mysterious, and an excellent swordfighter. After the main two fall in love however, she just becomes a tsundere. That’s it. She becomes a textbook stereotype, and exists just to prevent Kirito from looking like an absolute failure.
She doesn’t really have a huge impact on the anime by herself, but by holding Kirito’s hand, they take this anime and plunge it into the nearest ditch.
Their relationship is SO forced, and it also comes out of nowhere! It is the biggest factor in making this show so polarising. It removes EVERY good thing, the action, and boss fighting this show had to offer, and it puts itself as the main focus of this show. Like yeah, there are people who have no problem with this, but some people like myself think it was a very bad idea.
Also, Asuna, you’re in a game where you could die, for real, yet your major skill is cooking.... So logical. There is nothing noteworthy about the two characters after this point, there is no character development, as everything just falls into place for them.
Like it or not, this show is a harem. All of the (female) side characters appear to have an obvious interest in Kirito, yet of course he only has an interest in Asuna, which renders all of the side characters’ feelings for him, useless.  The harem part also introduces us to possibly the worst character in the show, Suguha, Kirito’s “sister”.
The only reasons I see her in this anime for, are: Kirito’s helping hand in the second half, and to create incest themes. Yes, this show had to play the “ Not Related By Blood” card. Pathetic. 
She also emphasises Kirito’s stupidity. In the final episode, where Asuna is now saved, Kirito spends time with Suguha instead of his girlfriend who he has struggled to save for the entire second half of the show. It’s as if they put her there to continue the shabby harem setting from the first half. If there was any point where the show was pointing the middle finger at the people watching, this was it.
ANIMATION & SOUND
The animation was done by A-1 Pictures, the same people who made Anohana and Black Butler, and I must say, they did a really good job with it. The action scenes were excellent, characters were animated well and the background shots were also very good. I have no major problem with the animation when it comes to this anime.
The soundtrack is by far the best part of the anime. Yuki Kajiura did a brilliant job on this one! She made use of choirs to make epic battle scenes more epic, as well as larger orchestral works too. Also, I enjoyed some of the tracks that sounded like something from Spice & Wolf, that gave a scene a real medieval feel. The one song that stands out for me from the soundtrack is the famous “Swordland”. It includes a large orchestra, and of course a large choir, however the song is more famous for the choral section which has been ridiculed by the internet, because the Latin lyrics sound like the choir is singing about food.
From the 2 openings and 2 endings, OP 1 is the major winner; Crossing Field, an energetic and upbeat song, with great vocals from LiSA.
There are no problems with the Japanese dub from my view, both Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and Haruka Tomatsu did a great job voicing the main two characters.
FINAL EVALUATION
Sword Art Online has the potential to be called the most overhyped anime of all time. I do understand why some people call this anime a masterpiece, and I can see why some say it’s the worst anime they’ve ever seen. 
Did I love this anime? 
No.
Did I hate this anime?
No.
It has some serious flaws, yet it was enjoyable. 
Is this anime a waste of time? No way.
 I found it entertaining, even though it wasn’t the best anime.
 Its flaws made it above average, and that’s exactly the score this show is getting.

                Most people will agree that the Aincrad portion of season one is rushed and that Aincrad and and fairy dance should be separate seasons. However this is NOT the case of ""the adaption cutting out detail"", the adaption actually did a wonderful job and cant really help that it is rushed.
the reason the first part of season 1 is rushed is because it is not an adaption of a light novel/manga but of a entry in a story contest. That's how SAO started. A little short story contest entry. so the author himself didn't provide the detail need to give Aincrad its own season.
                  after becoming a surprise hit, the author continued the story with fairy dance, phantom bullet, mother's rosary, Alicization, moon cradle, and unital ring. But good news is Aincrad season will be redone. After becoming a hit the author is rewriting Aincrad and is going floor by floor, (The Progressive version), and the adaption producers already gave it the green light once they allow the author to write enough ahead of them. but considering the anime was working with a small contest entry piece, it truly is a masterpiece. however once progressive gets adapted, this will look like complete garbage.",9
"
                This is one of the best mmorpg anime out there. If you are a mmorpg die hard fan this is a good anime to watch, its worth it. However if you have never played a mmorpg before you might really end up disliking this anime. there are tons of mmorpg elements in it.
The only thing i don't like with SAO is that episode 5-6 is really boring and tons of people dropped this series during those episodes because they are just too boring and uninteresting.
However if you can bear it up to episode 12 then you will start to think SAO is a decent anime
                  at least. 
episode 1-12 is epic and it will turn into the best anime ever if they made all the episode retelling the story between Floor 1 to Floor 100.
alot of people got disappointed because this anime jump from here to there and it is very fast paced. alot of things are skipped so there will be plot holes. 
Episode 12-24 is starting to get meh and its turning into a more brother-sister relationship rather than Kirito and Asuna. 
this anime might seem like a harem since all the girls in the anime very much fall in love with Kirito, but thankfully this is not a completely harem/ ecchi anime. since the girls sort of give up on Kirito in the end.",10
"
                The first 13-14 episodes were very good. If the season would have ended there, I would have easily given it a 10. But no, the creator had to do another round and so once the story is truly over, he starts it back all again. But only difference is that this time it sucks. The story is boring and slow, it seems as if they are trying to reach the mark of 25 episodes. And it's tiring to see another round of VRMMORPG.
Now, I am not sure if I should watch the sequel or not, from the description it looks very much like the 2nd
                  half of the series. Still I would recommend anyone to watch this series because of the good first 13-14 episodes.. Honestly, at that moment, I thought SAO will end up as one of the best anime I have seen thus far. But alas!",9
"
                Sword Art Online. As the title says. It is a virtual mmorpg in which players battle through 100 levels/dungeons to win the game. At the same time, this is a life and death situation. If you are killed, you will be killed in real life. Also, you cannot log out of the game until you win it. The sole cause of this is none other than the creator himself of SAO: Kayaba Akihiko.
Story-8
while SAO has a great opening into leading to a life and death game, the stories that follow aren't the greatest. For instance, the first episodes cover the first level dungeon, which then
                  leads to the game 2 months after, and then 2 years. The story could have shown much more details, like the types of dungeons, play styles, available classes and weapons, and lifestyles. However, despite all this, the story does come to a conclusion, a tragic one, which does make me want to watch the second season. The action scenes are great though. As ""sword art"" says, there are mostly fights with swords. They are also different types of skills and abilities that are affiliated with the sword. The first arc of season 1 is much better than the second arc (ALO) in terms of action. But at least in ALO they develop the game more. While the action scenes may not last long, it is entertaining to watch. It is questionable whether changing the game from SAO to ALO was a good idea, but the ending turned out great. I also question Asuna's impact on SAO on ALO. She seems to be a relentless strong-willed fighter, but is hopeless and unwilling in ALO. In all honesty, I prefer that strong fighter girls stay strong and fight the same way they have been, even if they get involved with relationships.
Art-9
I have to admit, SAO looks like a real world, even though it is a virtual mmorpg. The places and dungeons look realistic, yet crazy. The swords are associated with color, symbolizing the type of characters that people are. The clothing is also unique. It is not the typical school or casual clothing, but rather vary from cloaks to armored gear to dresses.The clothing also resembles their characters. The scenery is great in SAO. Where they fight, the abilities that they show, and even the music. 
Sound-10
This is why I like SAO. The OST is amazing. The action scenes have great music that follow along with the feelings that people feel. The openings and endings are great. It is pretty heart-warming. Usually I will plug in the SAO osts when I do my homework. The music never gets old. The fighting scenes, the romantic scenes, and everything else just works with the ost. It also matches the type of atmosphere of the virtual world. A beautiful landscape with a flute harmony is lovely to hear, while a symphony of violins and electric guitars shows fierceness and tension during battle scenes. 
Character-9
While SAO does not introduce a great deal of characters, they sure do develop the characters well. Kirito is always serious until he meets Asuna, and then they begin to have feelings towards each other. That relieves some of Kirito's emoness as well as his distress. In addition, Klein always lightens up the mood. He is like a ""comedian"", always trying to make the best out of dire situations. And egil is a strong and good-hearted man. Someone you can always trust. As for sugou, they make a great job of showing how evil he can be. You will hate his guts to the point where you will smash a wall with your bare hands. At least that is what happened to me. His evil plan almost seems impossible to solve, but even the smallest hopes can lead to victory. As for heathcliff, he is a well-designed clever man. He is strong-willed, but can be too arrogant. Even as he created the system, thinking that nothing can go above or beyond the system, he couldn't have been more wrong. Overall, each character has some sort of trait that stands out, and makes it easy for me to understand.
Enjoyment/Overall - 9
SAO is entertaining to watch, and can keep you on the edge of your seats. Each battle only gets more intense, and Kirito shows his true colors by the power of his will. Those with strong hearts will prevail, as many anime show, but each anime has its own uniqueness in will that really grabs the watcher's attention. SAO is not just a virtual game of life and death. It is a matter of what you care about most, and what you will do to protect, even if it costs your lives. They say that everything has a limit, but there is no reason why you can't exceed your own limit. While the second season may not be so intense as the first, the action is there. At least they have action. And at least the endings are great. I look forward to watching the second season of sword art online, that is if they green light GGO and alicization. I recommend this to younger teens from middle school to high schoolers. It is a little bit childish for adults and maturing teens into their adulthood. Nevertheless, SAO is not a big disappointment.",9
"
                I get mad when people defend this show and say that it doesn't deserved to be dogged on this much. Do you really want to die on this hill? Don't get me wrong, this show is probably the pioneer of most isekai out there now, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't ignore all the flaws that it has. The Kirito harem is forever growing, but none and I mean NONE of them are best girl. In addition, SAO loves to add a sexual assault scene in almost every single installment. Why do you do this? And why do you do it so wrong every time
                  that it leaves a sour taste in my mouth? This is a beginners anime. Enjoy it when you start your journey. Then continually look back at this show throughout the years and realize that this is a stinker after you watch a couple of gems. This is a show you can easily binge and action/story that can be enjoyed if you don't dive into the shallow water and hurt yourself at the bottom. Just stay on your innertube coasting down the lazy river while our MC saves the day and conquers every female in existence while the true hero Klein is left in the dust.",3

                Story (10/10) - Every gamer has asked the same question at some point: What would it be like to be in a videogame? 
The world of Sword Art Online answers that question as we watch 10,000 people become trapped and struggle to survive and return home. It clearly illustrates that it may seem like a dream come true, but some's dreams are another's harsh reality. The first-half of the anime was what most were expecting. It wasn't until mid-way that I feel most people were starting to lose traction in the story.
Art (10/10) - I felt that the art was nice. From the environment to
                  the characters' designs, it was amazing altogether.
Sound (10/10) - The Intro really set the scene for each episode as the ending of each was closed with the comforting Outro. Another thing I enjoyed was the music that accompanied each emotional scene.
Character (10/10) - From first-seeing characters, to watching them progress until the end was nice. Some stayed the same, some weren't as bad as we thought; an all-around great cast.
Enjoyment (10/10) - Why wouldn't I enjoy a show that answers every gamer's dream? From touching moments to high-paced action, it's a very enjoyable ride.
Overall (10/10) - Sword Art Online has received widespread commercial success for its animation, soundtrack, and for showcasing the psychological aspects of virtual reality. Some may just glance at this review and think 'Oh, another undeserved 10', but this was the first anime I thought truly deserved it. From the beginning to the end, and everything in-between, it's something you can come back to over and over and enjoy it as the same as the first time.",10

                So the first half of this show was what I expected. Being stuck in a video game and die in real life if you die in the game. The fighting was great. (Bit of spoilers after here. Sorry.) When Kirito got married, I was like, ehh, but I could live with it. Then they had child? That was a bit of a stretch for me. After he got out of the game was were it started to go down hill fast. Asuna's story was a bit weird and disturbing at times. I loved Kirito's sister, but did they have to have her fall in love
                  with him? Nooo. 
Basically, this show had great potential, but they didn't execute it correctly. Many mistakes were made and it went way out of wack. I liked the idea of SAO, but it had too many completely strange twists to it.",6

                Sword Art Online 1 and 2 and Ordinal Scale, Sodo Ato Onrain: p
an anime game that has a nice animation, its have good characters a lot, for this anime story is more towards romance than to the game.
the animation I feel good, from the fighting movement, then the swordsmanship technique, then switch to the duel shoot, also with the last scene against the boss SAO floor 100 (An Incarnation of The Radius) is very exciting, the sound of explosions, animation attacks, sounds of the song when fighting , very exciting.
the main characters are very good Kirito-san and Asuna-san, the two main characters are able to
                  bring this story with good and exciting, especially when the romance scene, romance romance is made really thrilling,
Other characters are also good, like Lyfa, Sinon, Zekken as well.
the story in this anime I think is an anime battle, but the romance component is so strong that the anime combat component is not very visible, more visible is anime romance.
may be renamed Love Art Online. * lol
because it turns out here are also many other online games, also a lot of moments romance.
then for anime story games that use floor level, in my opinion less interesting, because a lot of players who have reached the floor 50 and up with ease,
the number of floors 100, then all of a sudden they all have reached the floor 50 and above, I think quite fast,
I think that's pretty quick, and makes it pretty easy to play
whereas their gamble is their life. if indeed there are quite a lot of players who are already on the floor 50 and above should the game was easily conquered before the first boss stormed the 100 floors with all the players.
* just the feeling a gamer.",8

                Ah yes, Sword Art Online. The show that people either love to love or love to hate. There is plenty of justification for either selection really; but which one is ""more correct""? I'm quite convinced that this is one of those shows that elitists love to hate simply because it's overwhelmingly popular. For comparison, it's similar to One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach. In my opinion, they all have huge flaws that realistically keep them from being masterpieces, but are nevertheless enjoyable. Sword Art Online fits this description perfectly. It isn't that great, but it isn't really that bad either. MAL offers a nice little breakdown
                  of ratings that is very suitable for this series. Therefore, let's take a look shall we?
Story - 5/10 - 
----------------
I find it hard to imagine that most anime fans, without knowing anything but the basic premise of SAO, wouldn't at least be intrigued by the story of SAO. Many of us are RPG fans, myself included, which might have us drooling at the very thought of a VR MMORPG (I prefer the classic JRPG myself). However, the promising synopsis suddenly turns into a disaster of sorts. The first half, especially the first few episodes, is quite good. These first few episodes are dark and engaging in that it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  
You actually feel some emotion from the main character that is rather believable; and that, my friends, is necessary for good storytelling. There are differing opinions on this, but I don't believe one bit of it. I'm convinced that those who especially hate the first handful or so, haven't even seen them. They aren't the makings of a masterpiece, oh no, but awfully close. Then...the descent begins...
The story begins to take a turn for the worse. A lot is forced down the throat of the viewer. It becomes quite tedious. It just isn't as believable as the first few episodes. Sadly, it gets worse. Once the first ""arc"" is over, however, the story begins to clutch at straws. I've never read the light novel, but I don't need to...this portion was a mistake. This is where the story truly attains the peak of mediocrity. This is where the haters have reason to hate. This is the ultimate reason why I have given it a 5/10...half good...half not good. 
Art - 9/10-
-------------
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that I enjoy the art. The art is pretty good no matter how you look at it. Everything is beautifully detailed, which is what one would expect of a modern anime. The characters are also well done. Everything about this series in regards to art is beautifully done. It's not my favorite style of art, but when reviewing, it's important to minimize one's opinion as much as possible. 
Sound - 9/10-
----------------
I'm never really sure what to really include under this subsection. Ummmmm....the music is great? It fits the tone of the show which is what one wants when watching anything. The theme songs are memorable which may or may not add to your experience. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that there's really nothing wrong with the sound. It's great, a 9 out of 10, end of story. 
Character -5/10-
--------------------
This is the most controversial subsection of the entire rating. That sentence looks ridiculous no matter how I look at it. Anyway, I say controversial because some people think there was excellent character development and there are some who think the opposite. I have mixed feelings towards both departments. You'd be a fool to think that there isn't any character development. There is some real contemplation between the two characters that many of us would likely consider. The worst of it, however, is so typical among these types of anime (see Bleach). We are introduced to so many characters yet fail to see anything ""real"" about them. We meet character after character, and in a spout of magic, they disappear. Yes, I get one-time characters, but these characters are supposed to be notable. What's the opposite of notable? That's right, forgettable. Trust me, you don't want that.
Once the first half of episodes were over, I began to mock the show and its characters (much like I did for Accel World). The plot reaches such a point of ridiculosity that it becomes incomprehensible. The love triangle is so piss poor that it makes the villains' seem that much more awesome. Oh, and I assure you that the villains are not awesome. In fact, they are as far as possible from awesome. The reasoning they offer for their ""crimes"" are absolutely pathetic. To put it nicely; the actions of the characters are forced down our throats so much that we begin to lose interest and in the end we just don't care. How can a show be a masterpiece if by the end, we just don't care?
Enjoyment -6/10-
---------------------
I'd like to point out that I probably enjoyed the show more than my rating suggests. Does that make sense? It does!? Good. The first half of the show had me impatiently waiting for each new episode. It was probably THE show I looked forward to the most for this particular season. Unfortunately, this changed, and I was forced to sit through some tediously boring episodes. It was hard to fathom how I could experience such a change. I felt as though I was being trolled. I started to play around with the idea that I was simply viewing a spin-off, but nobody is that cruel, right? 
To those still questioning, I say to you, it is enjoyable enough. Not very convincing, is it? Unfortunately, it's the truth. The second half of the series shoots the entire show into the net of 'meh, it was enjoyable enough, I suppose'. That pissed me off. The entire show seems to a metaphorical kick in the...well...you know. Don't worry; I didn't forget the female anime viewers. To them, it's like a punch to the...well..I'll let you pick, I've heard both are painful. To sum the enjoyment factor up in to two words would be easy: it flops. 
Overall -6/10-
-----------------
I had a hard time not giving this a five. I ultimately decided that the show isn't mediocre. I don't believe that the ENTIRE show is mediocre. I'd even be willing  to give the first half an 8 (if I was feeling generous), but the second half really hangs around the 4 or 5 range. It just simply isn't needed. It's frustrating for us fans when we know that the creators struggled to find a good reason to continue. It's even more frustrating when a series shows such  high potential only to be ridiculous in the end. The photo for its entry on this website is even misleading. There are characters there we hardly learn anything about. That should tell you a lot about this show. But is it as bad as some people say? No. Is it as good as some people say? No. If there's one point I wanted to make throughout this review, that would be it. Neither side is right. It really is smack-dab in the middle. If this series was split into two seasons, you'd have a 'very good' (8/10) season and a 'decent' or 'mediocre' (4 or 5/10). For me, that is the absolute truth; but hey, it's stilll better than Accel World (doesn't take much).",6
"
                At first watching the show, you'll think this is going to be a super packed  action show......but turns into a harem, (there's like 3 major fights) with little backstory for each character. some points in the show don't even make sense. IGNORE THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON, its a waste of time, with a terrible plot, filled with plot holes.  
              ",5

                You either get SAO or you don't.
SAO covers many different sub-genres -so if you're not open to a wide range of different genres and looking for a straight up action go watch some power rangers because you won't even understand the draws in this series.
If you need everything MMO-based explained word for word in an easy to understand dumb-down way go watch Log Horizon because this series expects you to have a little common sense and be able to infer on how they work.
There seem to be a number of people bringing up that our main character Kirito is ""overpowered"", however this actually isn't the
                  case as he's constantly facing isolation, loss, and defeat progressively throughout the entire story. 
I'm not going to say the series is perfect, there are a number of issues I have personally with some of the scenarios and to be honest I think the Yui arc was the worst point of the series, but no one really seems to give mention to that since they're blinded by their hate. The fact is that none of the people that watched this series really gave it a fair shot, they were told by their friends ""Go watch this; it's the best thing you'll see in your life!"" and they went in with the highest expectations, and tried to nit-pick absolutely everything in the series and actually ruined the experience for themselves.
SAO was never really about Sword Art Online, it was about getting out, there was no point for them to extend the Aincrad Arc because the entire objective was not being there, hence the time skips which people misunderstood as poor pacing.
The ALO arc has many good points, however as soon as it gets to the ""incest-like"" part of the story, literally everyone who isn't okay with that sub-genre says the series is garbage and that it shouldn't have happened, which was really just another point that you as a viewer needed to be open to in order to enjoy.
While I've watched SAO 5 times already, I did watch the series once English dubbed, and it was absolutely terrible, the characters lacked all emotion, there were awkward silences and changes between certain dialogues and it just felt pathetic, so if you saw the English dub first, you've just made a fatal mistake.",10
"
                Although the opening, and the animation was good I feel that everything else sucked in general. First I'm going to start with the story. The story had a lot of plot holes, bad pacing, and useless filler episodes. Next I'm going to be talking about the characters. The characters get only little character development, often many characters feel unnecessary to the story, and the main villain of the aincrad arc's motives are never explained in the anime. In conclusion I don't recommend this anime to anyone. It has a very bad story, and a very bad characters. Thanks reading my review, hope you enjoyed.

                One of the worst isekai animes to ever exist  and its criminally overrated. Idea of SAO is nothing new its been around ever since first videogames, when i was watching this anime for the first time i thought to myself wow this anime is going to be long just like naruto maybe 150 episodes 200 and on every episode we will discover one floor with brand new place with different theme and there will be boss fight at the end that satisfies us pushes us to watch more, there will be character progression we will see kirito get better equipment geat etc. And what
                  SAO gave us ? 14 episodes 3 month gap between episodes half of the show is filler nothing exiting happens, full of useless characters that we see them die half episode later, do you guys remember the chick died in the arms of kirito what was her name ? idk rest in piss cuz thats how much you mean storywise. Until episode 8 we only see ''1'' boss fight. But we see around 30 erotic moment including tentacle rape. At least tag it as ecchi and show us tits if thats what you wanted us to watch in the first place i dont mind ecchi but its not what i am here for so 1 point goes to Story. Another thing that bugs me is rare but good fight scenes i wanted to see more 6 point goes to Art and Sound. Asuna ? more like ASSuna am i right ? cmon show us more partial nudity 1 point goes to Characters. Big disappointment never felt enjoyment other than ep 1. Overall waste of time i cant bring back. (And its the first season oh boy second one is even worse)",1

                I'll start off by saying that you should take the score on this anime with a grain of salt and simply watch it for yourself. This is personally one of my favorite anime. This and Steins Gate battle for my #1 spot all the time. My favorite type of anime  are Shounen/romance, and this is the best combination I have ever seen of the two. I have shown many of my friends this anime and they all have fallen in love with it too. I think that some people out there just have to be anime hipsters and not like an anime simply because
                  everyone else likes it. JUST WATCH OR READ IT. After you've done that you can judge it. If you hate I'm ok with that cause you gave it a chance. If you love it you'll understand what I'm talking about. SAO is a 10/10 for me =)",10
"
                My first review. Yay.
Anyways, this anime is awful. Don't be blinded by it. It's awful. The art is good, but that's really all it's got going for it. The characters are dreadful, and one of the most stereotypical anime casts ever. We've got the overpowered loner who can't loose and gets all the girls, we've got the love interest who is a decent character ti start with, but eventually becomes as useless Peach from Super Mario Bros. We've got the little girl who has a crush on the main character. We've got the full-grown girl who has a crush on the main character. Everyone likes
                  on the main character. Its a pitiful excuse of a cast. The story is all over the place, just the second episode takes place a month later. I honestly hated this anime, and I don't recommend it. Just because something's popular doesn't mean its good.",2

                WARNING : This review may be considered a spoiler by some, even if it contains NO revelations of the plot.
SAO is an anime with great potential(well used, by the way) , with a truly unique and was well developed story. Sit easily the drama in which the characters live , and it's even easier to hold onto them. If you are expecting an anime focused on adventure and RPG , I do not know if you 'll find it here .
The existing romance can cause some ""depression"" or even discouraged by some to be a bit exaggerated and take time, but it becomes something central
                  to the story development .
BUT UNDERSTAND : This anime does not focus on online RPG games or anything like that, but the existing human relations behind these and the relationship of humans with the power and death, what makes you unique and exceptional .",9

                I recently found myself rewatching Sword Art Online. 5 years after I first watched it and dozens of anime later I decided to rewatch it. This was the first anime I ever watched.
This anime truly changed my life as it sparked the love of anime within me. I thought this was the best show ever made, and it truly was to me back then because I had never seen anything like it. Now, after having watched many anime from many niches including the critically acclaimed Neon Genesis, rom coms like Tora Dora, action shounen like Naruto, seinen like Parasyte, and comedies like Saiki K, I
                  can say that I am well rounded in a general anime knowledge.
So now as i returned to Sword Art Online after 5 years of experience, Japanese learning, and a trip to Tokyo, I wondered if it was as good as I remembered. Now of course my review must be biased based on my nostalgia, but I tried to remove myself from that as much as possible.
Sword Art Online is, in my opinion, the most ""anime"" anime that there is. It has aspects of pretty much every genre: action, romance, slice of life, comedy, mystery, supernatural, fantasy and displays typical traits of both shounen and seinen anime.
The thing that drives my love for this anime even today is the fact that it's placed in a not so far-off future. The desire to enter the full dive system and experience the wonderful world SAO paints still exists in me today. This is truly what I believe was amazing about the anime. The artwork that captures this and the enjoyment you get from experiencing this real MMO is astounding. The romance between Kirito and Asuna, while (extremely) cheesy at times, that is created in this world is also something that creates a sense of pure emotion I cannot describe. Especially during episode 24 with the well-placed flash backs.
The story's pacing is uneven which is great in my eyes. You get a long time to experience and learn the world of Aincrad and SAO. But the story does not stand still, the character development works well and the show isn't afraid to kill people you grow to like. The pacing is one of the best parts of the anime as you never really get bored. As the initial wonder starts to wear, it focuses more on the plot and speeds up the timeline of events.
The OPs and EDs are exciting and emotional. The action is awesome. And the voice acting is great. Whether watching SAO with 0 anime under your belt or 100, you will enjoy it. Sword Art Online manages to combine all genres of anime into one and put it in an awe-inspiring universe with a gripping story to top it off.
Now many people call it bad and like to insult it. I think that this is mainly just done because it's the cool thing to do. Anime is not meant to be Oscar-bait, it's meant to create joy and emotion within the viewer, and SAO does it perfectly. You will enjoy watching this and get invested into the story and be astounded by the visuals. I also particularly enjoyed how this doesn't fall victim to the cliché ""Anime Syndrome"" of not telling a character something important even though you are given the chance.
For enjoyment, this anime is 10/10 and I would recommend it to anyone. But if you want to get into what SAO does badly, the following will be my critical review in comparing it to other anime.
Like I said, SAO has aspects of all genres. The thing is that it doesn't pull them all off as well as specified anime of that genre do. For instance, the romance between Kirito and Asuna, while enjoyable and cute, is not nearly as heart throbbing as Clannad and Clannad After Story. The action is very well animated and fast and cool, but the action of Naruto or Attack on Titan is much better written and animated and extensive. The story is very compelling and dramatic, but the story of Death Note is even more dramatic and compelling. The character developing is done well but not to the level of Toradora. Do you get what I am getting at? That is one of the flaws in Sword Art Online is that while it does well in every genre, it fails to excel in a specific one. The only thing it truly excels at, in my opinion, is creating an atmosphere. Another thing commonly critiqued of SAO is the characters. I have to agree that they are not particularly unique. Kirito and Asuna are both somewhat generic with no major flaws. Sure Kirito doubts himself and spirals after losing friends, but that's not much of a character flaw and is more of a plot point. This doesn't mean you won't enjoy the characters, I very much did. Characters do not have to be unique to be likeable. The immense character developing that goes into them makes up for this and through the great plot, you will come to be attached to their stories. Another character issue is that Klein should have been more present. We barely get any scenes with him but he's supposed to be a friend. Another particular choice of this anime that really seemed weird to me was the rushing of Yui into being a daughter-like character. The relationship built with her seemed rushed to that point and somewhat forced. This seemed odd, and after having seen many, many anime, it is notable when a relationship seems odd.
Any more criticism after this point is just nit-picking. I believe that no anime can be perfect, but this anime really demonstrates the true power of anime. The emotion it creates and the captivating story it tells can be enjoyed by all and is unlike anything other than anime. I am very glad this was my first anime. Maybe that feeling of first discovering anime and my emotions at the climax of the story cannot be re-created, but the memories will still last, and I still manage to get butterflies at times after 5 years of watching anime.",8

                      Hello, I am Sonic, full username, 44sonic10. Today I will be reviewing the anime Sword Art Online. Now I understand there are many mixed feeling about this anime, but... um... let's just get on to it. 
      So first of all lets get on the story, the story in my opinion was okay, no, no, close to decent. In the beginning, I thought the pacing was alright but I do think that at parts of the show it is very rushed, and boring. I understand that the anime bases off from the light novel.
                  But heck even the light novel's pacing was better than this, and the light novel actually is in depth! But at times of the show you feel like you are actually in the character's shoes so I thought that was great how they did Kirito's thoughts. I give this anime's story score a 6, the pacing brought it down so much and I really dislike two arc animes. If you would like a story summary go to this link- http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online
      Now lets get on to the art, I think the art does not need really much explaining, as the makers of this anime did a fantastic job with the animation and everything. Because of the animation and how epic it was I really think that this is one of SAO (Sword Art Online) most strongest points. I give this a solid 10. If you don't believe me go onto YouTube and search up a fight scene. :D
     We're on the sound, I'm not the best at sound but by my experiences I think they did a good job on the dub and the sub. The lip-sync was great and the swords clashing together was great. I give this an 8.
     It's time for talking about the characters, here are the characters you really need to know about... Kirito and Asuna. That's it. No Liz, no Yui, no anything but if you talk about the second Arc thats a whole different thing but lets not talk about that, sadly, I do not wanna review that part and if I did this anime would get a 2. Okay, anyway, back on track. The characters are funny and I love their personalities, but, BUT, after a bit the characters turn into pussies. For example, Kirito is scared of a huge fish? Like WTF. I give this section a 7.
    Personal Enjoyment, you don't have to know much about this part, all of the bad parts aside... I actually really enjoyed this show, I mean if you don't believe me, look in my rewatches of this. :P
    The anime may be horrible at points but I think it is also really good but I think the major things, Story, and Character (kinda). Should have been more thought out all of that aside this is still a very good anime and I think you should actually check it out! My overall score will have to be... a solid 8! Thank you all for reading my review and stay tuned for my next ones!",8
"
                Alright, so we all know the story of SAO, or at least what all the plot summaries say. It's about a boy, Kirito, who enters Sword Art Online, a virtual reality game, but the creator has made it so no one can leave the game until someone completes it, and if you die in the game, you die in real life. DUH DUH DUH.
This sounded SO FREAKING COOL. I was so ready for some bad-ass monster fighting scenes and some crazy magical sword skills and awesome friendships, etc, etc.
What I got was a love story. This anime focused so heavily on the romance that I
                  felt it let the good parts go in order to push along the romance. There were SO MANY directions this anime could have taken, and well I thoroughly enjoyed the direction they took, it wouldn't have been my first choice. I went into this anime expecting to like it for its bad-assery, but I came out liking it for its romantic charm. I was pissed or a long while at how they handled this but looking back on it now I can't discredit the fact that I did really have a good time watching it.
However, in the second portion of the anime things got super weird, am I right?? We had everything from elves, to sister love, to crazy rapist guys. It was a bit much. Nevertheless, if you are thinking of watching this anime I do recommend you give it a go!",8
"
                Honestly the whole concept of SAO sounds fascinating and that's what probably attracted me.
I mean virtual reality video gaming? That's so cool. It's something that's far from our present (hopefully not too far) and it's neat.
I would like to divulge about how there was 2 Arcs in this particular season.
The First Arc was heart warming great and to be honest it was some sweet 17 year old fantasy.
But when the Second Arc came everything went to shit.
Honestly I think that it would've been great if they just stuck to the first arc. Like forever. But what can I say?
Taking advantage of the sales, popularity etc,
                  I guess it just screwed up the whole anime in general.
Well that's just my opinion so don't take it too harshly.
So for the first arc, my overall rating is what it appears to be rated about this box.
But for the second arc and anymore (including ""season 2""). It's a -1. 
I highly recommend not to watch it past the first arc.",7
"
                Sword Art Online suffers the same fate as a lot of anime, unfortunately. While having a beyond interesting concept that has endless amounts of potential, it falls short because it focuses too much on a cliche romance that downplays both parties involved. With a one-dimensional romance combined with a Gary Stu protagonist that barely does any work and yet is seen as the hero, it falls short in too many areas to count. Some deaths are just meaningless, villains are not intimidating or three-dimensional, and some arcs are just completely unnecessary. 
Honestly, the only reason this anime got the praise it got was because it
                  involved being inside a video-game world, and that wondrous potential overshadowed an endless amount of flaws that makes this anime meh at best. I highly recommend you look somewhere else if you want something of actual substance.",3

                If you’re familiar with World Of Warcraft it won’t be hard for you to figure out what Sword Art Online is. That’s right, it’s a high-tech online RPG that allows you to transfer you consciousness inside the game and it’s sole purpose is to take you away from your meaningless boring life. The most philosophical line in this anime is, ”There’s nothing more boring than to watch someone else play a Role Playing Game” and ironically this anime requires you to do exactly that. Having said that I’ll admit that it’s not all that bad, the animation alone makes it worth watching.
The story is about
                  a boy named Kirito who spends all his free time playing SAO and spends no time with his step sister/lover who lives downstairs. One day SAO’s creator also known as the game master traps all the gamers including Kirito inside SAO and makes sure no one can leave without finishing the game. Why, you ask? To fulfill his childhood fantasy. How, you ask? I guess you’ll have to watch it for that answer(It’s too complicated). Dying inside the game means dying in real life. Being a nerd Kirito turns out to be really good at the game and shortly gains a lot of attention. Later on he meets a girl named Asuna(A hot nerd, who’s also very good) and they fall in love. Thus begins a love story that’ll make most of the guys envious and so ‘irritating’ is the right word to describe it. Allied with a bunch of other nerds they work hard to finish the game to free everyone from the game master’s clutches. Most of the events in this anime sticks out as ridiculous but I’ll still say it’s innovative and rather amusing to watch.
Overall I’ll give this anime  : 7.3",7
"
                Tackling a dark concept, with a dynamic story line Sword Art Online shines as an example to Anime storytelling. 
Characters tackle nearly every human emotion, each time tearing your heart out with pity, hope, and tension. And with each event the characters develop and mature in multifaceted ways. 
The show pulls you into its world, surprising you when you are reminded that they are still playing a game.
Romance, tension, drama, and bits of comedy combine to create a show with a deep compelling story line. I can't recommend it more.

                Okay, I promised myself I wouldn't write a review for Sword Art Online, but here I am just because I honestly think SAO doesn't deserve half of the shit it gets. I am not a hardcore SAO fan, nor a SAO hater, so for once, here is an unbiased opinion on the anime; Sword Art Online.
Story - Sword Art Online's story isn't the most interesting although it isn't the worst and I actually quite enjoyed it. The adventures the characters have along during the story is far more interesting and is often overlooked by people. 
Art - The art is fairly mediocre although it is
                  clear and easy to look at whilst also showing action during the action scenes. Although being pretty unoriginal it suits the anime.
Sound - The sound is decent for an anime, it provides mood and sets the scene as sound should although it isn't anything special. The openings are also fairly enjoyable to listen to.
Character - Here is where the most shit is received. The character. Kirito is not a flawed character by any means and although this isn't great it doesn't ruin the anime, sometimes a perfect character isn't bad to watch. Although despite Kirito being perfect, many of the other characters; Sinon for example are flawed and imperfect as well as well as most of the other side characters. Although Kirito himself isn't flawed it's interesting to see him interact with the other characters.
Enjoyment - Sword Art Online is a fun little anime to watch. You don't have to be a hardcore fan to enjoy it but rather like it for what it is. I know many people who hated the show until they actually watched it, where they found a fun little anime. 
Overall - Overall the anime doesn't deserve the shit it receives by some, although it doesn't deserve the praise given by others either. SAO has it's weird scenes and moments, however at it's core SAO is a reasonably good anime. If your going to shit on this anime, please have at least watched it first so you know what you're talking about.",7

                First of all, I´m a huge fan of Sword Art Online. I´m in love with its concept, its main characters and everything. I´m not going to be imparcial, let´s be honest. 
Besides all of this, I know that it has a lot of problems. The author made the story to participate in a Japanese competition as a complete begginer. With a 200-pages limit, he tried his best to come up with a great plot with a beginning and an ending. I think that´s why the story itself focus so much on the main character, Kirito, and we can barely see any secondary character. So I
                  understand that there are people out there that dislike this Anime saying that it has time skips, no secondary characters deep development, etc. This story was published on the Internet, and because a lot of people loved the story, the author continued it going forward, and that´s the problem: building a huge franchise with no solid base.
In my opinion, SAO is going better and better from its start, specially talking about the Alicization Arc. It doesn´t feel like the author is trying to write more books only for the money as the narrative doesn´t feel in a hurry and stories are very interesting, at least for me, and I have great expectations in SAO Progressive: its meant to be a reboot of the original Aincrad Arc but going step by step, with a slow pace, and I hope it can build a great development of characters and, overall, to set a solid base to the entire Sword Art Online franchise.
I have seen all SAO anime, including its only film, and I´m writing this review after reading the first two light-novels, including all Aincrad arc.
I have to say that, as far as I am concerned, the Anime is a clear transcript from the light novels. Everything that happens in the novels, happens in the exact terms in the Anime. So that´s a +1 for me.
I personally think that the animation is fine, but it could be better if we had more chapters, longer fights... but that didn´t happened because fights in the book where also short as f... I prefer the Anime to stay canon all the time. Talking about the art, I of course love it. Kirito and Asuna are pretty similar to the original ABEC concepts, they both look very good and their outfits are pretty nice.
Talking about the sound, oh my god... inside the game, the environment sounds, combat scenes... I would say they are ok. But when talking about Openings and Endings, I have to say this: I loved and still enjoy all openings and endings all SAO franchise have, seriously. Is not like Naruto that there are pretty amazing songs but some others that are pretty normal for me. In SAO, I enjoy every single one of them. Crossing Field by LiSA, Yume Sekai by Tomatsu Haruka, Innocence by Aoi Eir, and Overfly by Haruna Luna.
Character development, as I said. I think they all look cute, but it has a lot of problems. Secondary characters doesn´t seem to affect both Kirito and Asuna decisions or future events, and we cannot see their past, maybe because in SAO it was not okay to talk about their ""real-life"" outside Aincrad, but I just think that it was because of the author. Or he forgot about setting great characters development, or he just wanted to focus on the main story to fit the 200 pages limit extension.
This season is divided in two separate arcs. The first one being Aincrad or simply SAO (first light novel) + secondary missions or characters (second light novel) as Yui, Silica, Lisbeth or Yuuki stories. The second one being Alfheim Online or ALO. Talking about this second game, I like the idea of flying, but I really don´t like all the ""elf"" theme with those pointy ears. So in this second game I was not seeing it because what was happening in the game, but mainly what was happening in the real life. I think the character of Suguha is amazing as she has a real development. She feels so human... And no, there is not any kind of incest in this Anime. Sugu has lost her brother for 2 years, and when he wakes up she wants to start to have a better relationship with her brother. But she is told that Kazuto is actually her cousin, and start to feel some emotions for him. That´s not ilegal, they are just 15 and 16 years old confused teenagers. They don´t do anything, Suguha tries to shut down her emotions and begin to fall in love with a guy she just met in an online game. This characters still don´t do anything, and when she later realizes that person she just met is actually her cousin, she feel again destroyed. As I said, I don´t see what is bad about this, and I really enjoyed to see all these emotions in this arc.
Overall, I could give this season a score of 7 because I know there are better well-made Anime out there. But SAO became my favorite Anime and I feel so much love for its franchise that I have to rise the overall score to 8. It can have worse characters, worse plot, worse fights than other Anime series... but if in the end I enjoyed the hell out of this Anime, and I feel so atracted to it, I cannot lie to myself.
I really think it is a good Anime. Do I recommend it? Not really. I mean, if you want to see a good serie I can recommend, I could say other animes that have a better plot or a great and solid base.
If you watch this season and you don´t like it, it´s okay. Don´t watch the next seasons and everything is allright. We don´t have to like the same Anime.
If you watch it and actually like it, go on. I think SAO improves each Season, and you can get a better experience if you can also read the light-novels. Also, SAO Progressive is going to have a film really soon. Maybe they do a great job and we can all experience what is left from the original story. And don´t forget Progressive is considered as canon. Maybe in a few years it won´t be crazy to recommend to watch Progressive first, and then jump into these Anime.
PERSONAL OPINION IN SOME FAQ:
Why is Kirito so overpowered?
It is told that Kirito has been playing MMORPG games from a long time ago. He seems to not enjoy his real life and focus a lot in the games he play. In this particular case, he was able to play as a beta-tester in Sword Art Online, so he is already better in the beginning of the Anime than almost everyone else. When he realizes they cannot exit the game, he inmediately leave the main town to earn as much experience as possible. And this becomes his main goal in life, to become better and better. I think we would all like him to struggle a little, to see boss fights that are actually close, etc. But I don´t see a major problem in all of this. I understand he is the main character, that puts incredible effort to be the best, and later he will feel invencible because he wants no one to die, specially Asuna.
When Asuna meets Kirito, she starts being more passive, less independent, etc.
I think both Kirito and Asuna fall in love and want to protect each other. They momentarily leave all the boss fights and actually question if they can never fight again to live in peace. They soon realise that people need their help to finish the game, and not die.
I understand dissapointment in some people in the second arc about Asuna being trapped inside a cage like a doll, but she has nothing to do. She is powerful, don´t get me wrong, but the story tells us that its impossible for her to leave from the inside. I just think the author wanted us to be frustrated and worried about Asuna. That´s all.
Yui is saved because Kirito now is a professional hacker.
Yeah, it feels a little artificial, I have to say it. At least in the novels they want to emphazise the fact that Kazuto left Kendo when he was 6 years old or so because he was more attracted to his ""mother"" job as a web designer. He starts to work and study a lot about computer, machines, etc. He will later in the Anime produce some electronical equipments by himself, so I just want to think that he has been in touch with computing a long time ago in the real life. We can also think that he just made a backup of some data, from a computer that was previously unlocked by Yui... But yeah I get it, a little of ""Deus ex Machina"".
I hope you enjoyed this review!",8

                Is SAO a complete dumpster fire? No.
Is it really worth your time? No
It inhibits the worst place where large Toblorones and the Bible Black Dub loath to look into. That black pit, is utter mediocrity. 
Kirito is Jesus Kun and even excusing the scenarios that are justified in universe for being OP, that fails to excuse him being utterly unbeatable except when people cheat even when there is no level disparity.
The entire rest of the casts consist of a single black guy, Klien, the guy who should have been the protagonist, and a harem of females who are sexually assaulted by monster, Kirito or both.
The
                  art's good, so's the sound design for the most part, but everything about the plot feels bare-bones, poorly paced and scattered and because all the characters either suck balls or are trying to suck Jesus-kuns balls you really can't get invested with individual character arcs (which is a power that can save for over arching plots quite easily, if the characters are interesting enough. EG Seinfeld).
Go watch the Abridged series, it's better paced, better reasoned and the characters have real, human emotions despite being a collection of negative character traits more than actual people.
It aught to be noted that I love both traditional and subversive Shonen and actually enjoy some of the better Iseki shows. This one is just not very good.",4
"
                Sword Art Online is about a virtual world where a lot of fighting and hardships occurs.
Through this anime, Kirito tries to break free of a virtual world that he is trapped in along with 9999 other people and he has to complete 100 floors to do this. 
This animes combines romance,action,adventure and a virtual game world all in one.
The one negative thing I will say about this anime is I felt it was quite rushed and would of been better if it had continued for longer and  if it had shown more about the character's personal lives.
I think people should watch this anime if
                  you like the idea of a virtual world, sword fighting, and that it is only 25 episodes",9
"
                Sword Art Online was and is a flawed but entertaining watch.
Okay, so why? Well...I think that the hype the series was getting sort of raised expectations - and yes, I'll be coming back to this point later on - for what I was about to watch
Now, I won't be including a plot synopsis as I think almost everyone will have seen SAO by now and if you haven't well then so much the better because you can draw your own opinions by watching it. All that said, let's get to the actual meat of the review, shall we?
The story and Characters:
I liked the concept of
                  the series and it started out really strong with a great pilot episode that knew how to hook an audience. The first arc of the series had some pretty likable characters and a fairly good storyline. I'll admit I was happy with the end of the first arc of the series but I thought it could've been better.  Then the second arc started and, oh boy, where do I start? It was just uncomfortable to watch. I can't really say much about the second arc without spoiling it but I'll try my best. The story for the second arc was, and I'm probably going to get totally roasted for this, I thought it was okay; but the lead female character was now a generic damsel in distress character and although she does get a few cool moments it's just not the same.
I don't think I've seen a series like SAO at all, that said I believe the concept of the show was done in another anime series - the name of which escapes me for the moment - so the idea isn't that unique but it's unique enough to stand on its own two feet.
The action scenes were really cool to watch and the comedy was mostly funny; there were times where I was left scratching my head in confusion but most of the time it was quite fun. An added bonus was the bare minimum of fan service (at least until the second arc of the series) which was a nice change.
The only real problem I had was with the pacing. It takes a few minutes to give some background info and then we're thrown into the world of SAO. From there it takes off at breakneck speed. Now, okay it did slow down; allowing for some decent character moments and development but the majority of the series felt very, very rushed and I feel it could've done with a bit more time to develop the relationships between characters - particularly the romance between the two leads.
Art and Sound
The series is beautifully animated and scored is just perfect throughout the entire series. There were times where the soundtrack brought me close to tears. This anime is just a feast for both the eyes and ears.
If there was any CGI in the series (which seems to be a common thing nowadays), I didn't notice/recognize it. The art style itself was very fluid and the background images were beautiful to see. The style and animation quality was consistent throughout the series.
I don't know much about voice acting but watching this series in English instead of in Japanese with English subtitles; it felt very natural - the performances didn't feel forced by any means. 
The music was beautiful and as I said before I was close to tears a few times because of it. I have listened to the OST a few times and I love it.
Now for the big question: Did I enjoy the series? Yes, I did. Overall, I thought the series was pretty good and even with it's flaws there was and is a lot to be enjoyed here. Yes, the pacing does get a bit erratic and yes, the story felt a bit rushed but I think that this series as a whole was a good piece of solid entertainment. 
That's my review, thanks for reading and I'll see you all again for the next one!",8

                Sword Art Online was just amazing. The second half was a bit of a let down, but I personally think that it's still awesome.
Characters: All the characters were unique, and honestly it felt like a MMORPG style character development. It was your basic OP main character, but it showed a lot of the struggles that each character went through. 
Story: Like I said, beginning half is amazing, but the second half is a let down. I think a issue is that the story went from action to more romance in the end (not that I have a problem with that) and it lost a number
                  of fans.
Soundtrack: The music was ON POINT!!! Music always helps give anime the chilling effect that Mangas can't and they did a awesome job in SAO
Overall, I feel like SAO is a enjoyable anime and that everyone should definitely watch it considering that it's going to get a 2nd season

                Many of you may look at the overall score of this anime and see a 8.3 but when looking at reviews it looks like a 5-6. This is because as many of you know the more popular an anime is the more hate it will get. The people who hated the anime are more likely to write a review to show their frustration. This is why you may see many negative reviews as the people who enjoyed it are less likely to write a review.
Anyway sword art online was an anime i thought i wouldn't like at first but the concept of the story and
                  the feeling i got from watching drew me in. Although there may be similar stories it just felt new. The art was very good, what you would expect from all new upcoming anime. There isn't much else i can say. Even though i consider this one of my most favourite anime there are still of course negative. The first thing was the pacing was a little to fast, they would skip ahead (they should of adapted the first part of the season into 24 episodes). The romance in the anime was a little force from no where a couple was formed there wasn't any real build up.
Overall i really enjoyed this anime, i didn't really expect it to be this good all the elements of the anime fit so well. I think despite all the negative feedback everyone should at least watch the first three episodes to decide if they will like it or not.",9
"
                In my opinion, if you're an average MMO gamer - meaning to play some MMOs but haven't really immersed yourself completely into the genre - then you'll enjoy this anime. It takes your imagination and helps it soar through the skies with the dive-in concept of virtual reality. The plot surrounds itself mostly around a romance between two gamers, but it still incorporates humour and adventure (with a pinch of thrill).
Story: 7
It is a very interesting concept, similar to other anime but unique in its own style. The romance is a little weak, but the comedic parts are great, especially after the lows of death
                  and failures. The bi-season change was not expected however, if the season ended with the end of SAO, then I feel like it would make more sense.
Art: 7
Not much to say here. Scenery wasn't overlooked during fight scenes, and monsters were illustrated well.
Sound: 7
The OST is beautiful, and supports the story well.
Character: 7
The characters are drawn with every detail in mind, from their hair to their outfits. It's easy to fall in love with the protagonists, their personality are well thought out, and the chemistry between Kirito and Asuna is sweet.
Enjoyment: 9
Overall: 8",8

                masterpieces are hard to come by. And when you come across a masterpiece such as sword art online, you know that you are in for a ride! the story elements, the characters, just everything that you find in this anime is absolutely amazing!! Lets start with the story. without spoiling anything, the story is amazing!!! firstly, The concept is amazing. It is the kind of concept that could go wrong very easily, but luckily sword art online was executed perfectly!! But i will also have to give credit to the amazing art and sound design. Because the opening music together with the flashy animation in
                  the first fight, was what sold me on the series. But the show would off course not be anywhere near where is is now, without its well fleshed out character, kirito. he the kind of character that gives you inspiration and courage, while being badass at the same time!!!! I really enjoyed this show, and would recommend this to anyone!!!! it is with no competition, the best show in the world.",10

                The first episode was definitely a jewel, it was excellent and i thought i'd stick to sword art online till the end. But unfortunately as the series goes on, the story lost its complexity and its opacity which made the series boring.

                when i first saw it, i thought it was a anime about drawing swords. I went online looking for anime to watch and saw that sword art's popularity was quite high. And off course i decide to give it a try. I was truly amazed by the artwork and the characters. Everything looked wonderful and it really caught my interest.
Definitely give this a try or you will miss out

                So, even though I'm not really sure how to write one, I will keep it short because I, myself, don't usually read reviews when too long. 
I wanted to make a review of SAO because of what I want to say, after reading some of the top reviews that I've come across, about the fact that any of those do justice from my point of view to what really SAO is or was: a pillar for anime. 
The story: the plot was revolutionary. Never forget that before this serie there were no isekai. I remember how I was blown away when watching the first episodes.
                  The art was so fresh, not only because of the drawings and the beautiful colours but also (maybe) because the plot was like a redesign of fantasy: a new and diversified version of the ""mainstream style"", which flavoured each scene with a sense of bliss. I'm glad that I watched the show right away and not after other isekai anime. I think that made me grow even more into anime. It's like watching the lord of the rings as your first fantasy film, nothing else will be the same. And I recognise that SAO has some flaws, but it never failed to deliver, and I think that the hype which builds up at the end of each episode makes up for the little boring Kirito. In the end SAO is a solid one in the entire panorama of anime which also stands as the father of a genre, and if you decide to watch it just keep that in mind, that everything you've seen in other isekai come after SAO, and many of them don't even come close to be better or even equal to SAO; the sequels are way inferior to the first one, the only one that come close is alicization, but it's still way worse.",9
"
                It is probably the greatest and most famous love story after Titanic. The Romeo and Juliet of the Anime world. It's a ""Still a better love story than Twilight"" . I am sure we all know about witch anime I am talking about. Dear readers, give it up for the one and only... SWORD ART ONLINE.
Plot and Storyline
We are again in the near future. Everybody in Japan is excited because a new Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online has been relisted.  The thing about this game is that you can control your avatar through nerve waves with the
                  help of a new technology called ""Nerve Gear"". What nobody knows, they can't log out as the game creator is holding them captive. The worst thing is yet to come. The only way to log out is to win the game by defeating the bosses on all 100 levels or floors. But, if you die in the game, you die in real life too. Let the survivor game begin...LINK START!
First of all, Sword Art Online (SAO) has only 2 seasons. I don't know why a lot of people say that there are more seasons. The seasons don't depend on the game the main character is in. Clear now? I hope.
 Season 3 will start...well nobody knows for sure, either end of 2015 or Summer 2016. Anyways it's coming. And I am soooo excited! 
SAO has one of the best stories ever, and that's why I think it has so many fans out there. A very interesting , catchy and most importantly unique story with a step-by-step developing plot . The thing about SAO is that there won't and can't be another ""in game"" anime, because every copy would just be SAO again. Kinda. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. One more thing, it's true. SAO is more a romance than action anime. It is both but the accent is set more on the love story rather than on action. In my opinion the virtual game and action were just the background so that the love story could emerge, which is not cool at all. They should have at least put more awesome fights and a bit more psychological tactics play into everything . In short the amazing story kinda falls in the shadow of all the romance, what I think is just a huge waste. A very interesting comment on season 2 from my class-friend: ""They made a harem show"". And they did. I never liked that in anime shows, but no, the Japanese keep on doing it. Tons of girls fall in love with the oh so cool main male character, and he doesn't mind at all. Oh If only I were at Asuna's (the mains girlfriend) place... Never mind, let's move on.
I am personally not a huge fan of love stories but I have to admit that SAO softened my heart a little bit. I believe that we'll have to wait some time for another great anime story like SAO to appear. The only problem I have with SAO now is that season 1 was way better than season 2(or at least the second half, the first one was good).Now I am scared that season 3 will just ruin the whole story it is by now. Hopefully not, my fingers are crossed, I hope yours are too.
Characters
The characters in SAO are actually not that special. There are some interesting ones like Yui, Keiko...There are just a few character development I've noticed, and the only thing that moves the mains further is love. But they still deserve some details to be told. 
Kirigaya Kazuto is in the very middle of the story. He was kinda always a ""solo"" player and never wanted to join a guild. What I really liked about him is that right after the Death game was announced a lot of players gave up at once, but he kept calm and accepted his destiny. The only thing I didn't like at all about him is the fact that he had the chance to play SAO in the beta test but didn't share his knowledge with other players. Not kawaii at all Kirito (his nick in the game). However, he soon realizes his mistake and becomes aware of what he did, making him the hope of SAO.
Kirito soon falls in love with cute Yuuki Asuna. Asuna is also a very skillful player and she earns the title Flash because of it. Although we don't learn much about her in season 1, the ending of season 2 is just about her. She is a girl that is born in a noble family, and as always she hes a lot of obligations towards her parents. In the middle is actually the relationship with her mother. It's a very moving story and I think that there are a lot of girls that can actually connect to it. If only everybody could just log their parents in their world, including me. A very caring, nice and at cooking skilled optimistic characters. Yuuki Asuna. 
Animation
The animation of this anime is satisfactory, not a WoW but not bad at all. But I have to commend the look of each floor and the landscapes. They really look amazing. Also the diversity of the characters and the costumes inside the game. Beautiful.  I wish AION looked more like SAO, but okaaay...(Btw. If you are playing Aion my nick is Yunome and I am currently level 32).
Conclusion
Sword Art Online is indeed a good anime and I really recommend you to watch it, if you haven't already. It has everything a good anime needs, an interesting story, a romance and action. If those three components are combined together you won't regret watching such show. SAO really has a very featured love story what caused the anime to have a couple of haters too. In the end I have to say that it is still better than any other romance show or even movie I've evr watched, including The Notebook, Dear John etc.(Just to make things clear I watched all this because of my friends, I am not a romance genre lover, but I don't mind a cute anime love story from time to time.) 
But seriously now, it is great. The majority on MAL also thinks that rating it with a 8.06 that describes the show just as it is. 
I loved SAO , you will too.

                  Sword Art Online has been a fairly popular show among the anime community. Whether it is overrated or the best anime to date we can all agree it has some issues.
   First and for most I love the concept of the story even though it has been done multiple times before. The concept has always had this soft spot in my heart because of my passion of video games and how cool virtual reality would be. But when you milk the concept for too long it makes it become less appealing and a complete hassle. The first arch is decent and
                  acceptable, then the second arch just takes the story into a irritating and unnecessary turn. If they would have thrown away the second arch and focused on putting more depth into the first arch it would be a decent story. However, they didn't and it was really just a big frustrating hassle.
  The animation was good for the most part. Although, I could find instances when it did lack such as the less important moments or sometimes in fight scenes but mostly it is good for the majority of the anime.
  The characters were awful, they had barely any development making them feel like people you just wouldn't really care if they died. The relationship between Kirito and Asuna wasn't developed or executed properly they just felt thrown together. Granted they did have one episode to build upon their relationship but other than that the relationship relied on what they went through that episode. I will say that probably the best characters are the antagonists, especially the second antagonist he was such a jerk and disgusting guy you wish he would get punished from the get go. If you are watching Sword Art Online for the characters you'll be very disappointed. 
Sword Art Online is a good concept executed poorly and milked beyond the limit that it starts to feel like a hassle instead of a well put together anime. I would recommend to watch it on Netflix rather than buy it, especially for it's outrageous price.",6
"
                For me, Sword Art Online was a guilty pleasure. As a huge fan of video games, especially online mmos- I went into watching this with an excitement that could not be contained! However, a few episodes in, this excitement quickly faded away. The visuals were stunning, so I continued to watch- but the story was full of skips that did not give the characters the necessary time to grow or for the relationship between characters to seem genuine. The story which started strong, was very mediocre. I would have also liked to see some of the minor characters who had all of an episode or
                  two arcs, what happened to them, and more about them. Because the pace of the anime was so fast due to the skips, they just felt very replaceable.  I went into watching this anime excited and hopeful but by the end I was very disappointed. 
I would have liked to see a lot more in the show that dealt with what was actually advertised. It's not to say that it was all bad, the visuals as I said before were stunning, and the sound and music was great. There are some touching scenes, some cool scenes, some scenes that make you go huh... but not enough to make me feel like it was completely worth watching.  I probably won't rewatch it, as it was a guilty pleasure and too much of a guilty pleasure is well...too much. ;) If you're looking to watching something that passes the time and doesn't take much thought, then Sword Art Online is for you. However if you want something that gives you a little more than flashy visuals and a mediocre story I would point you to other Animes in the same sort of genre of Sword Art Online- such as Accel World(which is not without its fault, but I found was much better than Sword Art Online). 
Some animes deserve the hype that surrounds them, however, sadly, Sword Art Online does not.",6

                I must commend SAO. Truly breaking the mold in Japanese entertainment, SAO is the first real mainstream anime to both enrage and exhaust you. Truly a commendable achievement. I have watched a lot of anime. From Bleach to Psycho-Pass to garbage like The 8th Son and Conception, and yet SAO is the only one that gets me indescribably angry. 
I hate it. I hate everything about it. I hate that Kirito never works and gets everything. You remember the memes with Shaggy and ""I'm not even using 1% of my power""? That's what this invokes. I hate how there's never a satisfying buildup. I hate
                  how there's never a fight that makes you think, or give a general shit, and it doesn't help that the main male lead is a horrible bore. Kirito sucks. But don't worry. He's assisted by a cast of equally inept dipshits who would give anything to fuck him. Almost every stupid character in SAO sucks because they exist either to bang Kirito or to be his braindead yes-men. And the villains? Every villain is so fucking lame. They show up, knock some shit around for like a minute, and then you'llneverguesswho gets mildly serious and then *BOOM* threat gone.
I hate this show. I hate Kirito. And most importantly I hate that this is considered passable. People like this garbage, this refuse. People think this is good.
Do not watch this show. Skip it and waste your time on something better. This is an insult to the medium.
I'm only giving this a 1 out of 10 because MAL won't let me rate it in the negatives. Fuck this show",1

                This anime is a breath of fresh air! 
I love that the protagonists' relationship is absolute. Even though there are other girls around, I constantly felt comforted by the feeling that they will be together by the end. The romance developed quite fast, IMO, which bothered me for a while but I dig their ship so hard and seeing them like an old couple warmed my heart. I also love that both of them are very strong. They treat each other as equals and more so, they know each others' moves by heart and could support the other without so much a word. Also, did
                  I mention the fight scenes? Yeah, I dig that too. Those scenes will push you to the edge of your seats and will leave you gasping for more. (But in all fairness, this is my common reaction to any fights with huge swords and epic fighting skills.)
The second arc was somewhat a downfall though. Asuna wasn't present in most episodes and only got short scenes in those she's in. Also, I didn't like the other girl so much. This particular arc is where we see Kirito in his down side. Always depressed and mourning for Asuna. Despite all that, I love seeing this side of him.
I can see why some people hate this anime. I'd probably dislike this too if I weren't into a heart-warming romance and epic fights and slow plot. But somehow, these three elements combined with the mangaka's writing totally worked out very well for me.",8

                I love Sword Art Online, I am in love with Asuna, I like her face and personality. Please give SAO a 10 star rating or I will kill you with my death note. And remember, if you die in the game you die in te real life hahahahahahhahahahahahahha. I don't know how many characters do I have to write pleas I am tired of typing. Sword Art Online is a pioneer of its genre in that, the source material dates from all the way back in 2002 (.hack// being of the same vintage). This is important to note as with all pioneering feats, there is
                  an initial sense of wonder and hype, followed by disappointment as the same concept is refined and improved upon. To give an example, the Victorians pioneered the underground railway in London, a marvel at its time but it was soon realised that they dug the tunnels too small. The tiny, overcrowded trains of today cannot be appreciated for its breakthrough in technology. SAO, due to its nature therefore shows the same seemingly obvious flaws that only become apparent in hindsight.
With that said, SAO is a fantastic piece of work considering how the author was only a high school student at the time, and how he ventured into previously unexplored territory. The author and the subsequent adaptation by A1 pictures successfully manages to impress the intended audience; the teenage market. This is done through a careful blend of adventure, cliffhangers , pacing, deux es machinas and a good cast of girls.
The show starts off with a highly interesting premise with players in a perfectly modelled virtual reality. Since their consciousness is surrendered to the NervGear hardware, the only way to return to the real world is through the “Log Out” button which has unfortunately gone walkies. We follow the life events of our protagonist, Kirito as he battles his way through his ups and downs, which is not limited to fighting.
Kirito also faces a daunting challenge emotionally, as the stakes are exceptionally high. A death in-game equates to death in real life. These obstacles flesh out the human nature of Kirito’s character in great detail. His behaviour, emotions and actions are closely related to his recent happenings and experiences. Kirito starts off as a social recluse who prefers to limit his interactions with other people. This leads him to shun the cooperative nature of MMORPGs and plays solo. Through a chance encounter, Kirito manages to befriend a group and re-learn the significance of friendship and comradeship, and how that improves his mental well-being. This does not lead to the unrealistic result of Kirito becoming instantly socially adept, as he faces further obstacles and setbacks that push him back to his reclusive old self. Such flaws truly show that Kirito is simply a mere mortal with variable emotions and feelings, which serves to connect with the viewer with empathy. For Kirito is only the strongest player in SAO due to his effort and research, rather than simply being perfect. Only through real experience can Kirito grow as a person, and the growth is closely tied in with the story.
A1 Pictures is to be commended for only highlighting the most significant parts of Kirito’s story as he fights to clear the game. Thousands of hours of level-grinding which was normal in the Everquest era of 2002 (when SAO was written) has given way to achievement caps relating to the hours you play in a day in 2012 (when SAO was adapted). To put it in simpler terms, the firms that make MMORPGs implementing such caps means the community has democratically voted with their wallets that level grinding is far too troublesome and boring.
We are therefore treated to relevant side stories instead of level-grinding filler. Each of these side stories involves an encounter with a supporting cast with wide variations in personalities and nature of the quest. Through the use of variety in the story, not only do we get to see Kirito develop, but also the world. The viewer is introduced to the world of MMORPGs involving Guilds, Raids, Smithing, Conspiracy and even a compelling virtual romance that becomes the foundation of a timely rejuvenation of Kirito’s character. Relationships however, are a two-way street and Asuna’s (the main heroine and Kirito’s girlfriend) worldview is also seamlessly influenced, and improved. The two-way nature of the relationship really makes it convincing, and leaves a lasting impression. The end product is an Asuna, despite her obvious flaws as a human, becomes a character whom many would look up to, due to her dedicated and faithful nature that was born out of hardship.
All of the above really shows that the writers performed an exceptional job. The accurate portrayal of the fickle nature of human emotions, and especially during the tumultuous years of adolescence really brings the show to life. The level of language, and the tones used by the voice actors were highly appropriate. They successfully avoid Kirito sounding like an aged professor with a PhD in SAO, and a realistic mix of rational decision making and emotionally-charged angst is used.
The quality of writing continues with the way the villains are portrayed. The first major villain, Kayaba is an accurate rendition of the genius, lost in his own world, which he seeked to control. He is the prime example of a person termed as a sociopath. The best aspect of him however is not his character itself, but the way he integrated himself into the storyline, and produced the most unexpected plot twist. This twist is a very crafty, and convincing one due to it being totally out of the blue yet in hindsight, perfectly plausible.
The second villain, Sugou on the other hand, is the purest example of a villain in recent times. Villains are meant to be bad, but not all can be successful at being bad and unique at the same time. A recent, highly successful example to compare is Raoul Silva, the highly-acclaimed villain in James Bond’s Skyfall. Not only was Silva bad, he was amusingly bad and obviously received pleasure from just being plain ‘badass’. In SAO, Sugou betters Silva by not only bringing amusement, but also the purest feeling of disgust against the character. In essence, Sugou is the victim of his own success, and the show goes to great extent by detailing his personality and motives. The icing on the cake is when Sugou subjects Asuna to the unthinkable, further solidifying the author and A1’s innovative risk-taking with the series.
Although show is somewhat lacking in all-out battle action which comes across as strange, due to its highly suggestive title; the art of swordcraft, the worry is misplaced. The rarity of such scenes only serves to enhance the excitement during the boss battles. The immersion is further exemplified by the convincing use of light effects during animated scenes. This highly appropriate use of animation technique serves to amplify the effect of each, and every single hacking and slicing motion. Instead of Diablo-style hack and slice spamming, we are treated with the significance of each motion. A1 Pictures have clearly taken on board the mantra of quality over quantity.
Unfortunately, following the mantra means the show tried to cover too much, in too little time. An attempt at too much quality in too little time. SAO attempts to provide a realistic and varied portrayal of the world of MMOGs. They have unfortunately made the pioneer’s mistake of being far too ambitious. Some characters are casted a little too far to the side and that includes those that greatly influenced Kirito’s development being one-episode wonders. This is especially evident in the ‘Aria’ sub-arc where A1 Pictures attempted to cover too much ground in a single episode when Asuna was introduced. Nevertheless, while this may seem detrimental, the flip side is of course, the less intrusive nature of the side cast. This approach avoids the trap of character bloat which other series have fallen into. Despite the blunder with ‘Aria’, Asuna gets the focus she needs later in the series.
The excellent writing and animation is greatly amplified by the renowned composer, Kajiura Yuki who worked on the music. The style of the music resembles her most recent previous work (Fate/Zero), but is sufficiently different to set it apart, reminiscent of the time she worked on Mai-HiME and Tsubasa Chronicles back-to-back. She forgoes her usual techno, and instead utilizes a greater reliance on classic instruments and the orchestra. A highly appropriate decision as the art of swordsmanship and the resulting swordfights are traditional in nature. Despite classical instruments being rather ‘soft’ in comparison with electronic music, Kajiura delivered beautifully with the softer style actually multiplying the effectiveness of the battle scenes. Her mix of opera in the battle tracks only serves to give a sense of ‘epic’, seen in the likes of “The Lord of the Rings”.
It is important at this point to mention that SAO actually has two, highly distinct arcs. The second arc is not a death game, but a race against time. It also gives a much-needed change in pace from the seriousness that hung over the first arc. Unfortunately, the benefits of a slightly light-hearted arc is also its downfall. The sense of urgency from the race against time was not portrayed in the best manner, with Kirito taking seemingly pointless detours, which in actuality was in fact, perfectly reasonable. A1 Pictures disappointed in this regard, disconnecting the viewer with the character’s decision-making. Nevertheless, the detours sets the foundations of Kirito developing in the real world, and explores his relationship with people that are the closest to him. Aside from the minor drawback, the quality of writing is still very good (but not excellent) and the quality of animation and music is maintained.
All in all, the excellence of the individual components (e.g. sound, animation) come together at the end to give the viewer an anime that is pleasant to see, awe-inspiring to hear, and minds in intrigue with the story. A1 Pictures has successfully created an adaptation that entertains a wide variety of audiences. SAO is a must watch for fans of adventure, fantasy, romance and even harem. Even the detractors derived a whole new level of entertainment, expressed in forms not limited to reaction videos on YouTube. The product’s success is clearly seen through pure, objective evidence by means of Blu-Ray sales as viewers have overwhelmingly embraced SAO.
Overall, SAO gets an excellent 9/10. A truly enjoyable series that crosses an extremely wide range of anime fanbases which is no mean feat. It is probably fair to deduct a single point in light of the slight weakness in ‘Aria’ and in the second arc but not any more than that due to the amount of ground that required covering in order to complete Kirito’s development.
Now that I’ve mentioned ‘Aria’, there is another anime of the same name. This series must never be watched, for it involves girls simply rowing boats for 3 whole seasons. Worst of all, a ‘moeblob’ (in other words, ‘moe[brown stuff]’) loli character is introduced, being evidenced by her having an S-tier Zettai Ryouiki. The wise community must avoid such monstrosity going after easy cash and stick to shows of a deep and profound nature, such as SAO.",10

                This is my favorite anime by far, while I do love everything about this masterpiece, I realise that it's not perfect.
For the story, I find it strikingly amazing and fantastic, the problem is that there are plenty of plotholes and inconsistencies, but overall, it is really involving, it has everything, comedy, romance (witch I loved), high stakes and shows us the lives of the charachters in a dangerous world.
I have nothing to complain about the art of this anime, it is great, the charachters and enviroment look beautiful, it's really immersing and detailed.
The soundtrack of this anime is amazing and I have never seen anything
                  like it. I'm always listening to the intros and outros, and the melodies, played in battle and other moments.
MC is absolutely fantastic, all I have to say is that all charachters could have gotten a little more depth and developing, but it is not bad as it is.
Overall, I love this anime and I despise the fact that hating it has become so mainstream in the anime community. Hating on SAO is an easy way to get some people to agree with you and have they ""let you in"" in the community. Its retarded and whenever I see someone meme-hating on SAO I prepare myself to discard they opinions to the trash bin they deserve to be. THERE IS NO PROBLEM on disliking it and pointing out it's flaws, but it's been six years now and it has become overdone, I can tell genuine criticism from the meme-hating.
Give it a try and don't listen to the haters and you are likely to love it as much as I did.",10

                this is my first review so dont hate :D
STORY: the concept of being trapped in a video game and have to beat it is a good one, but they turned it in to a harem anime -_- kirito in the beginning with asuna was meh, the first few episodes was okay, but they started introducing all these random girls who has no purpose for the original plot ""getting of the videogame"" the second half was pathetic -,- they just wanted to stretch out the anime as long as possible.
ART: the art was gorgeous as expected for a-1 pictures
SOUND: i love the songs in the opening
                  and the ost's and the voice actors was okay.
CHARACTERS: 
Kirito-  generic protagonist who gets strong and get the biches
Asuna- Asuna was okay for the first half of the series but she becomes almost useless in the second half
Suguha-was there for only the supporting plot for the second ""cousin incest""
Yui- is cute :3
ENJOYMENT:
My first watch was okay for me but when i rewatched it i saw all the flaws and mistakes.
OVERALL:
its an okay anime for the first half, but the second half.... dont bother, the second half was shi* and all the other seasons are basically useless -,- they are only trying the stretch it out as long as possible to make de moneh.",5

                Some may disagree with my ratings for this anime but I guess I'm entitled to my opinion. 
I loved this anime and its sequel so much, I binge watched probably half the episodes in a day which in hind sight may have been a mistake as I didn't have much to watch in the long run. 
I feel that it mixes character development, emotion and action perfectly in what  I believe is a fairly unique plot. If you're a gamer, you'll love it. If your a romanticist, you'll love it. If you just love anime in general you'll love it.
One of the main things
                  I love the most is that because of the nature of the story (no spoilers), SAO has the ability to have you on the edge of your seat almost scared for what's about to happen and on top of that, something which is usually a big issue for me in most anime's is that the love situation in SAO isn't a massive tease. The love story works out and is one of the other main reasons I'd recommend this to anybody.
The voice actors used I feel fit each of the characters very well, of course I'm speaking for the Japanese voice actors, I cannot speak for the dubbed versions, and also the artwork and animation was top notch meaning that at least for me, the anime all in all has very few flaws, if any so to conclude I'd say this is a anime everyone should watch at some point as its full of enjoyment, intense scenes and fights, romance and a happy ending that we all love.",10

                Sword Art Online is an anime that popularized the ""trapped in another world"" storytelling premise that is overexposed in varying capacities with a number of recent anime and was originally explored a decade earlier than Sword Art Online with .hack//SIGN. Like the mentioned show, both have divided opinions among fans for one reason or another as many were turned off by .hack//SIGN for being dialogue-heavy and not as full of action compared to Sword Art Online, an element which is one part of what drew fans more easily to the series. However what may be more accessible to casual anime fans does not always necessarily
                  make for a good quality series, and Sword Art Online is rife with plenty of issues throughout its run.
First, let us explore the core element of Sword Art Online that drew in its fans in the form of its ""trapped in another world"" premise. For the world of the series, the thousands of players trapped in the online game are forced to play through it in order to free themselves from within it and will actually die in real life if their online avatars are killed while within the game. The series gets into some decent ideas with exploring how this could affect players in differing capacities, but a myriad of reasons related to story focus and pacing kill the amount of depth this could have gotten and felt too dumbed down as characters like Kirito seem too well-adjusted mentally to their dilemma. This pales in comparison to its predecessor series, .hack//SIGN, which actually devotes time to exploring the mental trauma this situation would have on its affected player, Tsukasa, who goes through varying stages of development with his character throughout the series as he copes with and tries to comprehend the circumstances that have him trapped in the MMORPG he is in.
Plotting is another issue that Sword Art Online suffers greatly from. The anime is divided up into two arcs with Kirito getting into different conflicts with two MMORPGs that he takes part in for Aincrad and Fairy Dance. Many fans think of the Aincard arc as the best arc in regards of quality since Kayaba Akihiko was a seemingly competent and morally ambiguous villain with the plans he had to trap the players within his game. However, the arc suffers from rushed pacing that makes the narrative a bit disjointed as it jumps through different points of time in exploring Kirito's interactions with different players and fighting against either enemy monsters or rogue players. While Fairy Dance arc has a more smoother narrative, its storytelling lacks the high stakes of the Aincrad arc and has a rather pitiful excuse of a villain compared to Kayaba. Also as the series is heavily focused on Kirito (who has his own issues I will elaborate on shortly), he is rather overpowered as a player as this kills the stakes of any major battle we see him in and in cases where he would be in some sort of crisis, the anime resorts to deus ex machina a great deal to have situations swing in his favor.
Characterization is also an issue with Sword Art Online as this seems to have quite a bit to do with the series being a sort of otaku gratification title with how it is structured. As our lead character, Kirito doesn't have much going for him in the way of depth beyond being your typical good-natured hero who is overpowered and feels too much like an audience surrogate for fans to get immersed into his experiences within online gaming. In addition, he seems to have a lucky streak in attracting many relevant female characters within the series to him thus leading to a needless harem scenario. As there aren't many other major male characters within this series, the choice of having nearly the whole female cast attracted to Kirito appears to be deliberate from the show's creators as the mentioned female characters are not allowed to be on Kirito's level in combat and don't get much depth beyond whatever affection they have toward our male lead. This especially hits the female lead of the series, Asuna, hard in later episodes when she becomes Kirito's main love interest and her character's strong-willed demeanor from the Aincrad arc takes a big hit in the Fairy Dance arc.
In terms of visuals, Sword Art Online is a bit of a mixed bag. It sports gorgeous and highly-detailed scenic shots found within online and real-life settings that are a treat on the eyes and character designs are decent in detail as well. Battle scenes are a mixed bag as there are moments of decent animated sequences, particularly during the Fairy Dance arc when the flying mechanic is utilized. However, animation shortcuts are utilized at a number of points with still and pan shots, which stick out rather prominently during heated battle scenes.
Overall, I find Sword Art Online's reputation for the ""trapped in another world"" premise of anime to be greatly overhyped. It comes with plenty of issues for its plotting and characters, and feels too much like an otaku gratification title with the depiction of Kirito's character throughout its run. If you really want a good ""trapped in another world"" anime within an MMORPG, you'd be better off tracking down .hack//SIGN as the series does a much better job with exploring the psychological effects of being trapped in an online game.",5

                ***Possible Spoiler***
This anime is pretty great and I really loved this concept, Being ""trapped"" in a Virtual Reality MMO, this is the ultimate dream for a gamer. Now, focusing on the story and such, the pacing seemed to vary at times. Some events seemed to last awhile, while, at the same time, end abruptly - same with the ending. Personally, as great as the battles were, I preferred the ""down-time"" when they were just living their lives in SAO. The artwork and music made the anime more awesome with its storyline, it is one of the best of 2012 in my opinion.
I didn't want it
                  to end, but, at least this way, it left while the series was still fresh in my mind.",9

                Sword art Online is a good anime (rated as 7). A lot of people are being vocal about it being some of the worst things they’ve seen, for me this was not the case. Sword art is however an anime of two halves (as you may have already found out), with the first half being much better than the second (a separate story in the novels). I urge you to see it through though and you can even finish watching before Alfheim online begins (second part, pretty obvious) as the Sword art section is very good, Hence why I’ll look at them individually
SaO:
The characters are
                  quite likable however, each of the characters you see on the cover picture (Kirito and Asuna notwithstanding) will have one episode each and I think that is one of the areas it could have been improved upon as there was not nearly enough development on secondary characters.
The story is a good one, and it will make you want to keep watching, as you really will feel the threat hanging over every character that one wrong move could result in their deaths, that being said there is far too much time skipping. The first level boss has a devoted episode, yet the very next episode Kirito and co have advanced about twenty levels, and personally I think the beginning of the 100 levels would have a been a good place to put a larger section of the series.
The romance sub-plot develops naturally, and you really want to see it advance, however I believe it goes a bit far towards the end of the series with talks of children.
There is a very good twist during the series which leads to the end of SaO and start of Alfheim which I never saw coming, which is a good addition, and makes you instantly interested in how things are going to unfold.
Watch it, it is a very good anime, and separately would get 8/10
Alfheim:
My biggest grudge here is how Asuna: Ass kicking female lead has suddenly been demoted to damsel in distress, and the romance sub-plot here is a little less likable and a little more…not….
The story progresses even more quickly that in SaO and could have done with another handful of episodes, but there is absolutely no threat involved, as you’re just watching everyone play a game, and death isn’t death.
This far through the anime you’re quite committed, but there is not really a draw in this one and is merely ok, separately would get a 5/10.
Ideally they would be separate series’ with SaO as 24 episodes and Alfheim as 12, however, I suggest making room in your day for Sword art Online, even if only the first part, not to mention that the score is pretty fantastic as well.",7

                Sword Art Online (or SAO for short) is perhaps one of the most controversial anime of recent times. And not because of some offensive joke, questionable morality, or avant garde presentation. Anime fans are just so decisively split on whether or not SAO is actually a good show. Many swear it's one of the best anime of the past ten years. Others say it's one of the worst of all time. The answer, as it so often does, lies between these two juxtaposed positions.
SAO is the story of Kirito, a gamer who purchases the titular virtual reality game Sword Art Online on launch day. Upon
                  trying to leave the game, however, he comes to a horrifying realization: They cannot leave the game and are in fact stuck inside the world of SAO.  If a family member tries to remove the virtual reality device, the poor player will have their brain fried. And if you die in the game, you die for real. The only hope for salvation is for a player to complete the game and defeat the hardest boss on the highest floor of the world of SAO.
This idea isn't particularly original, but SAO executes it very well. The entrance of the Game Master is full of tension and horror, as well as memorable visuals. Kirito himself makes for a surprisingly solid protagonist. While it is true that he adheres to many of the light novel tropes that keep most adaptations down, he does actually have some flaws and develops as a person throughout the show. People die because of his mistakes, and he has to live with that. The show also implies that in real life, Kirito is a complete loser. Living in the game world is a chance for him to be someone important, someone cool. The ""skills"" he wasted his life honing are so suddenly very valuable indeed. But of course, he is a light novel protagonist, and he has more than a few moments where he pulls of feats so completely senseless and narrative-breaking that it almost renders the emotional weight of the story moot.
Thankfully, the supporting cast is there to carry him when he fails (Or, succeeds too well, I guess). The other characters are fairly archetypal, but fun archetypes nonetheless. You may have noticed that the running theme in SAO is ""unoriginal ideas executed very well."" SAO has great animation, scoring and creative scene staging to make tired ideas seem fresh and exciting. It's very easy to forgive it for relying on tropes when it just does it in a way that's so much fun. Back on the subject of characters, Asuna is far and away the show-stealing side character. She acts as Kirito's love interest, but she is a fully fleshed out character in her own right and acts with full independence. She's also implied to be the second baddest dude in the game (after Kirito himself of course), so she rarely needs to be rescued and in fact saves Kirito's bacon more than a few times. Anime is full of underdeveloped female leads, but Asuna is not one of them. She and Kirito also have a very believable chemistry and their relationship feels very real, in a way few anime romances do. When so many anime feature romantic subplots that go absolutely nowhere (Or even backwards!), seeing a relationship that actually blossoms, grows and ends with a fulfilling result felt more refreshing than a Sprite water fountain in the deep south. And the anime as a whole reaches a very satisfying conclusion. Episode 14 ends the series on a strong note, and the viewer is left with an enjoyable anime series to reflect on.
Wait, what? It's not over? What's this elf nonsense? Why does the opening suck? Who is this new chick? Why is Asuna in a cage? No... no!
Halfway through the show, the action shifts to a new game world and everything that was enjoyable about the show previously is thrown out the window. Kirito ceases developing as a character, an awkward and VERY uncomfortable romance suddenly appears between him and his sister (WHY MUST ANIME DO THIS?), and Asuna is all but completely removed from the show as she becomes a damsel in distress. Not just a damsel in distress, but one frequently subjected to degrading fan-service (which the previous arc was almost entirely free of). The sharp drop in quality of the show is INFURIATING. It feels so needlessly tacked on, especially considering the show's strong ending with Episode 14. As if to insult the viewers, the great opening song from the first arc (""Crossing Field"" by Lisa) is replaced with an entirely forgettable new number. It lets you know right away ""Hey kids, hope you're ready for this show to suck now!"" The worst part of the new arc is how it blatantly emotionally manipulates the audience to continue watching. I was FULLY invested in the Asuna-Kirito relationship, and I NEEDED to see them end the series together. The villain of the second arc frequently tortures Asuna and is such a disgusting human being that I couldn't help but watch the entire second arc in a single night, just so I could see him get his comeuppance and finally put this show behind me. Of course, that feeling of being FORCED to complete the show only served to further soil the enjoyment I had taken from the first arc.
The sister romance is also incredibly uncomfortable. Though perhaps she isn't related to Kirito by blood (maybe she's actually his first cousin? It wasn't entirely clear), she has DEFINITELY acted in the sister role for their entire lives. And one does not simply become attracted to your sibling, blood related or not. The show cranks up the fanservice in this arc as well, as if it knows it desperately needs to keep your attention with such a tepid and uninteresting plot. I couldn't care in the slightest for any plot lines in the second arc, save for Kirito's end goal of rescuing Asuna. Consequently, the episodes become an absolute slog to get through. There is little to no real tension. Coming from the first arc where people could die at any moment, having an arc where Kirito is for all intents and purposes just playing a video game leaves the stakes feeling very low.
If there is one good thing to be said for the second arc, it's that the voice acting (in the dub at least) remains top-notch. There is a particular emotional confrontation between Kirito and his sister that resulted in me having a genuine emotional response. I legitimately felt bad for his sister, despite not giving a crap about her for ten or eleven episodes at that point. This is entirely thanks to the amazing work of her voice actress. Way to go, whoever you are.
The drop in quality from Arc 1 to 2 cannot be overstated. SAO begins as a fine show, full of familiar elements but executed with talent and a sense of fun and creativity that keeps it flowing to a fairly strong ending without skipping a beat. But immediately after the second arc starts, everything goes downhill and the viewer is tortured by the connections they made in the first arc into finishing the show. Would I recommend SAO? Yeah, it was good. But for the second arc, just watch the first episode and the last two. Spare yourself the pain.",7

                When it comes to popular anime series, Sword Art Online is always one of the names that comes out more often. Despite the general good reception, many people consider it overrated or dull. For me, is an OK show with some aspects above the average but also some enormous flaws. And yes, I actually agree with people who think that there is a giant wasted potential in this series
MINOR SPOILER AHEAD! BE WARNED, WANDERER! 
Story -6- Ok, let's start with the story. I will not summarize the plot because I think that everyone knows more or less the premises of the show
I was amazed when
                  I watched the first two episodes. I was expecting so much, an epic story with great plot twists, battles with monsters and ""red players""...the core idea of the show is just so fucking good that I still can't understand why they put it apart to transform it in a general romantic story
The Aincrad Arc was ok. I give it a 7 but is just...ok. I mean, it could have been much better, as I was saying. The story jumps to his conclusion too early: for example, it would have been interesting to actually see the first days of imprisonment in the game. 
We have a brief narration that tells us about this period. Why, in the name of God???
Let me see it by myself! Why you should skip maybe the most important part of the story?? 
Let me see the way people reacted to what happened! They have been trapped in a fucking game for God knows how much time....let me see how people started founding Gildas in order to survive and complete the game, let me see some badass players who decided to stay on themselves, let me see people crossing the event horizon and committing suicide for the shock! Damn, let me see how Kirito has managed to survive all this time. I want to see the protagonist struggling with his fear, I want to see him fighting the desperation and the shock, as he is only a teenager stuck in a deadly game who progressively becomes a badass, the way he interacts with other players...but no, we skip the first months of the story because...who knows? 
And sadly, the series skips almost all the interesting plot hints that it gave us in the first episode. We have those so called red players who kill other people to loot them. There is a gilda, called Laughing Coffins that is actually devoted to doing this. Well? No epic battle between Kirito, the other players and them? 
The story focuses to much on the relationship between Asuna and Kirito. And it could have been ok for me, if it wasn't the only thing that mattered for the way the story unravels itself. 
If the series showed me the two main characters fighting countless battles side by side before falling in love, I would have liked it much. If secondary characters have had more development and screen time, the ending of the first arc would have been breathtaking and tearjerking. For the way the show skipped all the interesting sub-plots that could have been interesting, it was just...good. I liked it but I felt that I could have liked it waaaaaay much.
The Alfheim Arc is terrible and it lowers the rating. 
Also there, main plot points are skipped or badly developed to skip to the conclusion. The relationship between Kirito and his step sister, who is in love with him, could have been very sad and deep. But the show doesn't develop it this way, it rushes everything. The fact that people cannot die for real in Alfheim, also, really kills the atmosphere of the first arc, that was the main point of the story, in the first place
So many wasted potential here. Sure, the story is not so bad as people say in their reviews. But, in the end, when you have finished the last episode, it leaves you with the feeling that it could have been endless better and not just ""ok"" 
Art -9- Nothing to say here: the art is by far the strong point of the series, altogether with the sound. Action scenes are just great, the characters are well-rendered and animated and the scenarios give a redefinition of the term ""Scenery porn"". Also, in the first arc, the concept of the city of Aincrad is awesome: the first time I saw this castle flying in the middle of nowhere, wow, I liked the idea so much. 
The best moment by far, under this light, is the ending of episode 14, where we see the virtual world falling in pieces in the lights of the sunset. Fantastic.
Sound-9 -SAO features some of the best opening and ending theme in anime's recent memories. ""Crossing field"" is great, you will found yourself singing it (well, trying to singing it unless you know Japanese) since the second episode. The background music is powerful, the sounds during action scenes are convincing. As for the dub, I'm from Italy and I have no complains about the Italian dub of the series, every character's voice, even the secondary ones, feels right for them
Character- 7-Another criticism that is often associated to SAO is the fact that ""There are no characters except for Kirito and Asuna"" and that ""Kirito is a dull protagonist""
""There are no characters"" is an exaggeration: background characters do their job, nothing more, nothing less. They could have had a deeper characterization, a better development, yes, but, as I said, since the story rushes to the end without a complete exploration of the many possible subplots and of the relationships between the great part of the characters, wel...
It's a shame, characters such as Klein or Argyle are there, screaming ""GIVE ME SOME MORE SCREENTIME! GIVE ME A BACKSTORY! I CAN BE USEFUL FOR THE PLOT, YA KNOW??"" but instead they are demoted mainly to extra. The show works more or less anyway, but this is another feature that I wish the authors had considered and explored more
I didn't felt that the protagonist was dull, instead. 
He is a loner who act by instinct, with a convincing tragic backstory (his gilda was destroyed to his fault and so he doesn't want to get close to anyone), he is the good guy who helps out people around him. I wasn't expecting a lot more, he is still better than a lot of main characters from more acclaimed animes and I didn't felt for a moment that he was ""Dull"", ""Not characterized"" and so on
And an interesting thing that no one noted about him (and thatI found interesting) is that he never openly says that he wants to complete the game, he just says that ""he will survive in this world!"" before he gets in love with Asuna. Then, at that point, his goal changes. In multiple occasions, Kirito is shown to be at ease in this virtual world. He doesn't give the idea that he is craving to get home, before, as I said, he finds a reason to get back to real life
Asuna, the other main character, is not the generic tsundere as I thought she would be (in the first arc, at least) she is pretty badass, considering that she is one of the few characters who kills on screen a person in the series...I don't feel either that she was a bad developed character, she is quite good for me
Enjoyment- 8-Honestly, I enjoyed SAO. I don't regret watching it. 
The fact is that I don't usually analyze every single problem that a show has when I start watching it, unless those flaws are really unbearable and ruin the watching experience
And, in my opinion, this one is not so bad that you cannot enjoy it. 
The action scenes are awesome. 
The setting is great. 
All the flaws that I have analyzed before, are reflections that I carried out after finishing the show. After all, I watch movies and anime to relax and enjoy myself, not to criticize every single thing that I don't like in it. There are indeed series that are so badly written or stupid that you eventually stop watching them because you can't even find a good thing in those. But this is not the case and who hate this series so much that he gives it a rate below 5 is probably missing the point of animated shows
The only part that got me shaking my head was the Alfheim Arc, there were some moments that were just...weird or bad and got me saying ""C'mon, what is this crap?"" aside from that, the series is enjoyable, if you can just ignore his flaws wich, belive me, are not so horrible that you cannot unsee them
BONUS - Aincard Arc ending (MAIOR SPOILER ALERT)
And now, am I the only one who was really thrilled by the revelation that Heatcliff was the bad guy? Seriously, that is one of the best moments in the show, one of the few things that couldn't have been better. And also, the final speech of Akhihiko Kayaba, when he states that ""he doesn't remember why he created Aincrad""
Why so many people hated that part and felt that it was stupid? 
He was a genius who created his own world. A world where he can be God, where he makes the rules. He was so lost in his delirium that he put the lives of hundreds of people to jeopardy just in the desperate pursuit of the meaning of creating life. And, in the end, he is satysfied because somehow Kirito defied the laws of his world, such as sometimes men defies the laws of their very world. This was the meaning of his speech. I didn't found it stupid nor incoherent with the series, it actually was pretty deep
So, said this, the conclusion
No, this show is light years far from a masterpiece. It could have been one, yes. The premises were that good. But in the end, it has to many flaws. The main problem is the linearity of the plot, the lack of a tangle of subplots and the scarce exploration of...well, pretty much everything. It can be reassumed in ""We are trapped in a game. We beat the game. We are save"" 
I could spend hours listing anime from where SAO could take inspiration to create a more dynamic and engaging world. 
HOWEVER...
The show itself is not trash, either. Is pretty enjoyable, nevertheless. If you reduce your expectations before watching it, you would probably not be disappointed like many people were. Give it a shot and decide by yourself, after all, not every anime series has to be a introspective and perfectly written piece of art to entertain his public
Ah, also
I deeply reccomend ""Sword Art Online Abriged"", also. It's a sort of parody/revisitation that you can found on Youtube, on the channel called ""Something witty entertainment"" 
It got me laughing my ass of and, in a couple of cases, copes with the problems of the original show :D",7
"
                as a fan of video games, it's only natural that this series really got me engaged. you really feel connections to the main characters. a terrific story of survival, romance and friendship all together in harmony. the music is absolutely stunning and always sets the scene the way its supposed to be. there are soft melodies for kirito and asuna and their relationship, one of the most beautiful in anime, as well as dramatic music for epic boss battle scenes, not to mention some times when something happens that makes you think, what was THAT about. characters great for the most part, although one of
                  the villains who appears in the fairy dance arc(episode 15-25), is a little hard to take seriously(trying not to spoil anything for those who haven't seen this) overall this is my personal favorite series, and with a new movie coming out in japan next year (and hopefully here shortly after that) i hope the series keeps going, because this story is just great 10/10 outstanding",10
"
                Spoiler-free part, read at will. Overall, avoid at all costs.
Quite honestly, this is the only time a show has infuriated me so much to even write a poor review. The review is as follows:
This show starts promising, gives you an interesting storyline, decent graphics and music. However, in the span of three episodes it pulls a very poorly executed ""Hancock"" on you (kills off characters it tried to setup, thus causing shock and awe in the viewer) and leaves you hanging with nothing to do. The show pulls the rug under you and doesn't even try to have the characters reach anything. It uses a
                  vulnerable spot on the ""viewer's heart"" due to the situation and then kills a character that the viewer may like, but without the proper setup for it. Essentially, killing a perfectly good character without any good reason. Again, avoid at all costs.
--Here's the Spoiler filled part, do not read if you still want to watch the show---
Here's how it kills one character it tried to humanize and have Kirito (the protagonist) assure her of her perseverance:
-Kirito is warned of Sachi's disappearance;
-Kirito tracks Sachi;
-Finds her;
-Assures she'll be fine;
-Return home and go to bed;
-Sachi still can't sleep and shares a bed with Kirito, thus barely setting up a sweet spot within the viewer and the main character as well;
-Jump forward to a dungeon where they all die quickly in succession, except the main character;
-Seems like a daydream, nightmare or otherwise a bad thought;
-It isn't.
-Show jumps towards Kirito being all depressed and shit.
-Avoid at all costs.
That's it. No setup, just straight kill the character in a shitty sequence that in regular shows it'd seem like a bad dream. After making such an empty promise too, the main character then feels depressed after their untimely death, but the show barely spent any time at all instilling the seriousness of their death. Instead they were something of the sort ""They died btw"".
Did I say ""Avoid at all costs""?",1
"
                The last thing the world needs is another SAO review, I know that, but I need to get this out of my system so I can move on. If you like the show, it's probably best you move along, there's nothing here of value for you.
I honestly went into watching this show not knowing what to expect. I'd heard the critics, but I also had several friends that just love the show and would constantly talk about it and get mad at me when I said I hadn't seen it and had little interest in it.
Finally, I just said screw it, and I started the
                  first episode and it was...actually not bad. The intro with the nerve gear and login screen got the gamer in me pretty hyped up, and I'm a sucker for hype OPs, so the show got my attention. The episode itself wasn't anything great, lots and lots of exposition, but it established the premise and the main character and things looked to be off to a solid start.
Things fell apart almost immediately. My biggest complaint about the show overall is blindingly obvious in episode 2, and that's that pretty much all of the characters, including Kirito, are unbelievably stupid. The way Beta Testers are hated on in the game makes no sense, the way Kirito responds makes no sense, the way that one guy refuses to drink the potion to save his own life makes no sense! This problem persists through the entire series where pretty much every important event is bogged down by how dumb the circumstances that brought it about were.
Beyond the characters, the writing as a whole is really bad. They establish the combat system as some kind of multi-player action rpg based on rotations, or ""switches,"" and attack combos, which, while not like any MMORPG I've ever played, is actually kind of cool for keeping the tension up because a system like this would require pinpoint timing or you're screwed, but the one mechanic they carry over from traditional MMOs is the stats system that makes most fights primarily determined by numbers rather than skill, as demonstrated 2 episodes later when Kirito takes on like, 7 people and they can't even scratch him, which effectively killed all semblance of tension for the entire rest of the series.
A less talked about thing I hated about the series was how epic they failed to earn emotional responses was. **Spoiler** (because there are apparently people that haven't had this show spoiled completely still) when the group of noobs Kirito was hanging out with died because they did something stupid and Kirito didn't stop them, it actually tried to play it off as a big deal, and I'm just left wondering, why? They didn't seem like bad people, but it was painfully obvious they were going to die, so I felt absolutely nothing when they did, and in fact got mad at the show when Kirito was balling over it because of how bad the set up for it was **End of Spoilers**
There are 2 main things I heard in defense of the show; good animation and a good romance. I'll actually concede on both of those, the animation looked pretty, and Asuna was by far the best character in the show, but neither of those were enough to make this a ""good"" show for me. As a point of comparison, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works did both of these aspects better in a similar death game scenario, and even that show doesn’t get that great of a grade from me because you need more than that, it’s hard to become invested in characters and fights when everything around them makes no sense.
The animation was pretty, and the character designs were actually spot on (though in Kirito's case ""vaguely cool looking guy with absolutely no distinguishing personality"" is hardly something you want to get spot on), but what was happening on screen never mattered to me, so the pretty animation was completely wasted.
As for the romance, the first time I felt any genuine enjoyment in the show was one time I was so annoyed at how stupid Kirito was acting that I said ""no you idiot"" out loud, and at the exact same time Asuna called him dumb too, and I actually connected with a character. Just to be clear, Asuna is not anything great, her personality changes from shy loner to confident tsundere to loving wife felt forced at times and was pretty cliche, but I did enjoy it, and I can see why people would love it. The reason this doesn't save the show from being horrible in my eyes is how they constantly undermine it with dumb chauvinistic crap. First of all, a 15 year old girl with Asuna's personality would be eaten alive by every gamer community I've ever been in, that's not sexist, that's just a fact, gamers are pigs, but if you get me to buy someone like Asuna is one of the strongest characters in the game, stop making her a damsel in distress, it's dumb. That said, during the romance arc, I was thinking of the show as a ""bad but not awful"" show, maybe 4 out of 10 overall, then...the ending happened.
I'm not going to spoil it, but the thing Kirito does in that access room and the way the final fight goes down are some of the dumbest things I've ever seen in television. Kirito does things that by all rights should be impossible, and there is no good explanation for it.
This review is only on the first 14 episodes. I give it a 2/10 overall. It almost constantly assaulted me with stupidity and lazy writing and it offended my intelligence. The second half of the show doesn't ruin it, it was already horrible. If you like the show, cool, good for you, just be grateful I'm not going to watch the second half, if it's half as bad as I hear, it would definitely push this rating over to a 1/10
Rant over, man I feel better",2
"
                First, one thing I'd like to say. I gave 10 overall because of the first part of the anime.
The story itself is amazing, the ideas about futuristic nervegear, playing virtual MMORPG, that's all we've been dreaming for. Trapped in a death game, being a solo beater. Having a cute girlfriend around. Lol. I really love sword art online that I even read all of the novels. I read the fairy part (ALO) even before the anime reached that point.
Truly I was really dissapointed, that the SAO part ended halfway of the 25 episodes and suddenly continued with ALO. It was way too rushed. I realized
                  that it was rushed from the first few episodes, with too many changing subjects and unexplained details going on. But still, the  transition to ALO part was horrible.
Details, we need more details, don't rush. I'm sure it would be hell lot better if they hadn't rushed it to ALO halfway, meaning 25 episodes of complete SAO.
The ending. If they had made the dissapearing moment of SAO as the ending. It would make an epic one. But they didn't, the even continued the hospital part on the same episode, truly I was shocked. Are they serious making this anime?
Regarding art, it was brilliant. I love the chara design especially the colours. But well there's something that's been bugging me. I can't sense any impact in the anime, like when you clashed your sword, or fall down, crashed. Usually you can sense that.
The sound, I think the sfx and soundtracks are epic enough, making you drawn to the anime
Characters are enjoyable, but people said that they let Kirito shine too much on the story and tend to forget everything. They even said that the movie was only about krito.
I really enjoy this anime but with it being rushed like that It was dissapointing.
Well this is my favorite anime so I'd give a 10 of course.
I hope there's a remade or if they're gonna make a new season please don't do the same mistakes",10
"
                Sword Art Online, what to say about this piece of work. Well I'll start with the good, it looks alright and the opening songs are decent for the most part. Though the openings visuals do leave much to be desired. The show's number one problem for me is the main character Kirito. Kirito is about as bland as a white fence. Though that would be a insult to the white fence. His character comes down to nothing but, ""I am emo and I rock at video games"". If you're a fan of strong female characters, TURN AWAY IMMEDIATELY. The girls in this show are just
                  around to be hopelessly in love with Kirito. And when I say girls, I literally mean, EVERY GIRL IN THIS SHOW. And this leads to a lot of annoying fan service that just makes already bad scenes/episodes even worse. The plotholes in this show are so frequent and obvious from the start that it makes you wonder if the creator did any research into video games. Fun fact: HE DIDNT. If you are a fan of video games or at least know the fundamentals of MMOS and RPGS then you will understand what I mean as SOON as you start watching the show. This show is so bad that it gave me writers block from how stupid the writing is. I think any decent writer who knows anything about video games or character development could do better. Heck, my friend could probably do better than what the writers do for this show. I would go into more detail about how bad this show is, but that would lead me to spoil the show. So I will end it on this, SAO isn't as bad as everyone says it is, ITS EVEN WORSE. Go watch anything else. Even the Dub of Fairy Tail is better than the Sub of SAO.",1
"
                We all know that Japan is very good with inventing technology, but in this anime the technology can make anyone jealous. 
BUT!! I don't think anyone would want to be stuck in VR for two years because some psycho made the VR world but forgot why he made it impossible to log out. Even though the reason for what happened is lost to all of us, this is still (personally) one of the best anime's I've seen so far.
The characters are good, the flow of the story as well. The struggles they face don't always feel hard enough to overcome, but like we all know
                  if the characters have good motivation and yell then they win the battle.
The story is very good and it makes you want to watch episode after episode, there are a lot of speculation with the success of this anime.I guess it just depends on the viewer in the end.
SO if you enjoy game play, romance, heart brake, and friendship. Then I definitely recommend this anime!!",8
"
                For the 2 people that have never seen SAO for whatever reason I am here to try to convince you to not watch said anime. Some dumb kid gets trapped in an mmo. He is good at it. Dual Swords you say? Amazing. He is the best, you will be constantly told this and how cool the son of a bitch is. A bunch of other people are also trapped in said game and if you die in it, it is game over. More crap happens, cliffhanger wait for season 2. Girl that plays said MMO that loves him ends up being hot IRL was
                  the biggest fantasy asset SAO had. Not as terrible as people will make it out to be but it is far from good. Dialogue is mediocre at best and bland as it can be. Asuna's VA is pretty good though. There you go, I just saved you time you could have spent huffing paint or fapping to Hestia.",4
"
                I've seen a lot of people give this a top rating and nag on others because they liked it and I did not. Im going to tell you why it is not a very good anime and here's why. Before I start I give this an overall rating of 3/10.
Story 2/10: As you know the Anime is split into ARCS. Each Arc last about 12 or 13 episodes so basically the midway point in a season of 25 episodes. I personally do not like the ARC way of story telling which this anime struggles with severely. The story is not very good, the story surrounds
                  around 1 character and his struggle in this anime's universe. This anime has one of the best CONCEPTS for a story ever. Trapped in a Alternate Universe. This anime destroys that concept. So the first Arc ended in my opinion the worst way possible and so starts the second Arc. The second Arc is the worst arc in the entire anime itself. Its boring makes no sense, does not explain the world they are in very well and develops almost no characters! The plot is even more simple than the other Arc, rescue mission is the best way i can describe this Arc without giving spoilers, this arc is basically a huge rescue mission and its simple the plot stays on the same track and I wish it were developed more than. Heres your antagonist....hate him cause he took this person. Arc ends as expected and people thought the anime was done and over with. I was unhappy with the anime at the time and when i saw the trailer for season 2 i instantly was resparked in hope for this anime.
SEASON 2, comes back with a waaaay more interesting story revolving a character named Sinon in the first Arc at least that what i thought until the arc was nearly over. It follows the same plot as the first season's first arc but the mystery of how people are dying is what intrigued me the most. The character development of Sinon was the best part of the anime!!! The episodes with her in the beginning of this Arc were just here with sprinkles of Kirito thrown in. I liked that they spent the time to make a supporting character the main role in the beginning and i was glad that the devs of this anime did that! Until it started to focus back on Kirito who gained almost no development the entire rest of the show... This Arc ends in a non cliche way (surprisingly) and it becomes a more happy anime after that. The second Arc in season 2 is what people think is the most sad in the anime. The second Arc follows another character with something happening to her in real life, it is a plot that has been used before in other animes but it is still very rare. This arc ends sadly and happily whichever you want to interpret. The anime ends here. 
Art/Animation 8/10: Though i didn't like this anime i did really like polish of this anime, they took extreme notice to detail and the animation looks smooth and not choppy, the effect that they used were very appealing and nice to look at, the world that was created was very well designed and it didn't seem cliche in the slightest. Overall this is one of my favorite art styles in any anime.
Sound 8/10: Whether you are watching the Sub or the Dubbed version this will change your mind. The sound in this anime is very nice, the music they play at points really fits the mood for the situation, the opening for both seasons are very well written and sound very nice! IF you are watching the Sub version you will find that the voice acting is very well done! IF you are watching the Dubbed version, the voice acting is horrible and makes the characters sound 4 years younger than they actually are.
Character 2/10: I was close to giving this a 1/10 due to the fact that the character development in this anime was horrible.There was one good part in the anime which made the development go from a 1/0 to a 2/10. I would rate it higher from how well it was done for the 3-4 episodes it happens in but there are so many character that they just used cheap and easy ways to develop characters like, oh no my *insert loved thing* died or something happened to them that makes me worry trick. In all the character development fits well with the story, they are both horrible.
My enjoyment with this anime is a 4/10, im a junky for well designed art and music and it makes me happy to see an anime put so much time and effort showing that to me. Though i may really be into those kind of things but i like it when an anime has a good story and characters that have backstory longer than a sentence. Basically all of my enjoyment for this anime comes from the music and art design as its the only really well made things in this anime.
Overall 3/10: Now that was my opinion on this anime. Im not happy with it, im really not. Looking back to my rewatch of this anime so i could make this review, It felt like torture to me, i almost fell asleep at points i was so bored. But I wanted to make this review to warn all the people that want to watch it. I personally do not recommend this anime, if you are really into video games and love action this is a good one for you. But if you are a person like me that loves story and action and character development then i do not recommend this anime.
Happy Travels!",3

                 Sword art online  carries the same amount of enjoyment as cleaning up after your drunk friend who took a shit on your floor,  it is exhausting to finish and smells rancid.  Shit taste online leaves a bad taste in most peoples mouths in for a good reason,  it absolutely blows. 
 To say the author Reiki kawahara is out of touch is an understatement. The author does not understand shit about video games or anything to do with them and he can’t write a love story if it hit him in the fucking face.  Don’t give me started on
                  season two and it’s uncomfortable rape scene  that made the entire audience grimace.  If you want a quality anime stay away from this so it is horrible.",1

                I've re-watched SAO many times but I recently watched it once again and I think I have a more clear understanding of it. A lot of people say that the love story between Kirito and Asuna ruined the anime, before I strongly disagreed with that. At the time I was so blinded by my own fantasies that I didn't realize how that whole ""love"" aspect really did ruin it. I don't think Kirito and Asuna being together was the issue, it was the over dramatic ""so in love we'd die for each other"". I also think Yui's entire character was completely unnecessary and inappropriate for
                  the show. Her character also added to the poorly done love story. I mean come on, Kirito and Asuna are teenagers why did they have to throw in a get married and have kids concept? (Although I do know that Yui isn't their real daughter) I think pretty much everything else in SAO was very enjoyable and I think the show could've been so much better if love wasn't a major theme; it took away from the deeper themes. However even with all this, I still give the anime a pretty high rating because I thoroughly enjoyed literally every other aspect.",8

                  Sword Art Online Is bad. Thank you, I’ll be taking my medal and leaving now.
Sword Art Online (SAO) has gotten the short end of the anime stick for the last decade now and for partially justified, partially unjustified reasons. It’s been collectively harped on by any sufficiently large creator in the anime scene and then beaten to death by the entire community. Despite what MAL hipsters might tell you, liking SAO places you in the minority. As far as many people are concerned, liking SAO gives you the dreaded “Normie"" label. SAO is far from perfect, in fact by any metric the show
                  is suffice to say, underwhelming. But thanks to being the anime community's punching bag, a lot of the actual merit behind Sword Art Online has been lost. I feel as though SAO has been unfairly treated; I want to take a deeper look at the success of SAO, Its immense popularity and impact and the subsequent critical reception it received before giving my own review of the series. 
* This Section has nothing to do with the actual review and is more an overview of the “Rise” of Sword Art Online for some background, feel free to skip it *
Cast your mind back. It's 2012: Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 just dropped; Far Cry 3 is taking the gaming world by storm; and Journey is a sleeper hit; but more importantly (or sadly, depending how you see it) I was addicted to Valve's brand new Counter Strike Global Offensive. You see, competitive gaming had its own mini renaissance in the early 2010’s. Many games burst onto the competitive market with some of the hypest gaming events we had ever seen. Azubu frost v.s Taipei Assassins in the League of Legends S2 World Championship or DreamHack in the winter of 2012, competitive gaming saw its first real major boom. So I think many of you can see the appeal behind a Video Game based anime, especially in an MMO setting which appealed to a lot of people. Games Like World of Warcraft, Maple Story and the Tales series captured the imagination of adolescents like myself. So it was to no one's surprise that in 2012 Reki Kawahara’s Light Novel of SAO received an anime for the first two major story arcs of the series by A1 productions. To say this anime blew up would be an understatement. This anime to this day is ranked in the top 5 most popular anime of all time (according to MAL) and has been in the discussion of anime consistently for a decade now. It’s easy to see why such an anime would capture the audience's hearts. There is an intrinsic link between games and anime with an abundance of anime inspired video games and vice versa. However this could not be said back in 2012. There was certainly overlap with people who liked games and anime, but the anime community on a whole at the time was quite esoteric. Sword Art Online closed that bridge between games and anime giving us a definitive Game based anime. Whilst there were series before that used the video game anime idea (.Hack//Sign) you can clearly see how after this brief “SAO renaissance” that a sort of boom of game based anime ensued the release of SAO (Overlord, Log Horizon, MMO Junkie) I like a lot of these anime, and I think if we were to judge SAO’s merit simply on its impact to anime in general, It would be quite positive. However over the years the reception of SAO critically has drastically fallen. People don’t like this anime, and it’s fine not to, but it feels as though a lot worse shows have been ignored in favor of lambasting SAO. On every platform (Youtube, Twitch, MAL) you find people mocking this show to no end. It makes me kinda sad that an otherwise mediocre anime has received as much hate as it has. I want to just say that I realize the hate towards SAO is rather tame, and that most people don't mean ill will when they criticize SAO, this is no darling in the franx. But I find it disingenuous that these “anime connoisseurs” claim to hate it as much as they do. In fact I'm almost certain that most of the hate surrounding SAO is just a byproduct of elitist anime culture; but I want to make a clear distinction between this admittedly small, yet vocal crowd and people who simply dislike the show. I’m aware that most people just don't like SAO and for a very valid reason. The show isn’t good and I wanted to talk about why.
*Start of the review*
~PART 1 : Aincrad Arc~
Sword art online is set in the near future where technology has advanced to the point where we can make completely immersive virtual reality; this is sparked by the innovative release of “the NerveGear”. Sword Art Online is a game that is the gateway to a fully immersive fantasy MMO. However this gaming sensation quickly turns to despair as the players who bought the game find themselves trapped unable to leave. This is part of an unknown scheme where if you die in the game, you die in real life.
This anime has a great plot. But that's the most praise I can give to this show. This Show sets up a world, gets you invested and then kicks you in the balls. The first three episodes excellently build the world just for it to drop off with a plethora of sloppy writing and poor characters. I could be nit picky and talk about minor issues (like how when people's real faces are shown, all of them are the most stereotypically attractive people) but SAO has capital B Big problems fundamentally with its narrative. First of all this series has no stakes. It has the illusion of stakes in its story. Main characters never die, and if they do, they are always brought back to life. Side characters are only ever killed off for the convenience of the plot. It doesn’t have to go overboard with the deaths like Akame Ga Kill, but there needs to be actual tension in the story. Characters with real personalities that aren't just cardboard cutouts. This issue is best illuminated in the moonlit black cats, a guild which Kirito briefly joins. We spend one episode with all these characters, and it is so obviously annoying that they are plot devices to make Kirito a sad emo boy. I knew that these characters were going to all die in the same episode. Why? Because you know a bad show wants to kill off a character when they start giving them a synopsis of all their personal problems and backstory like some sort of Shakespearean Soliloquy. This is exactly what happens with Sachi. It’s infuriating that what could blossom into potentially interesting characters are thrown out in favor of Melodrama. Even with me ignoring Kirito’s silly reasons for not wanting to show his real rank. That somehow people wouldn’t want to guild with him since he’s “too high level”. Which is a poor excuse the writers came up with so that Kirito doesn't have to show his level. But I digress, this issue is seen throughout the whole series, there is never a time where I felt as though a character was at any risk. But, on its own this isn’t a “smoking gun” that this series is bad per say. What I find far more egregious about the story telling in SAO is that nothing ever feels like it happened, or in other words, it felt rushed. The story is moving forward at a bit of a bumpy pace, but nonetheless the characters are progressing through the story at a reasonable pace, and then it just ends. The ending to the first half of SAO was abrupt to say the least. It almost felt like Reki wanted to be done with Aincrad and move on. At the very least the series could have reached the 100th floor but they didn’t even do that. Kayaba was never built up as a villain in the story (which I will elaborate on later). There was never any preamble to the ending, just a fight and it ended. The series would have benefited from having the 24 episodes dedicated to just the Aincrad arc, because I and many others would agree it's the best part of the series. The series didn’t even need to try very hard to get audience engagement. Despite my criticisms, There's actually a lot to like about aspects of SAO’s story. I like that Asuna and Kirito get together easily. Even if their relationship is staler than out of date bread and less exciting than the story of Halo 5 I liked that Reki picked a girl and stuck with it. A lot of series do the “will they won’t they” and it's so obvious that they are gonna get together, which is why I respect that Asuna and Kirito get together early. Another thing I enjoyed was actually a very wide range of genres that the series had. Each episode was sort of its own mix of different genres. One episode it’s a side story romance and then it goes into a three episode long murder mystery. Personally I enjoy this type of episodic anime, especially when It can still relate to a main overarching narrative (i.e cowboy bebop) . I Like this idea, it’s been done infinitely better by other shows, but I like it. I think the execution of this sort of episodic structure is a good idea, but not a well thought out execution. This is in large part due to the story feeling Juvenile. There's nothing wrong with writing and catering to a younger audience, but a lot of the more “mature” themes rarely add any substance to the story; this is a much larger problem with the latter half of the anime with the honestly disgusting misuse of rape, but it is still an issue in the Aincrad arc. There's nothing wrong with Sexualization, or even over sexualization so long as it’s relevant and fits the characters personality. But sometimes the way SAO handles its female characters teters on the edge of Sexist. I don’t believe that to be Reki Kawahara’s intention but that's definitely how it looks sometimes. Which Is why I find randomly flashing Keiko’s panties very Juvenile. It’s the type of fan service that feels out of place. I realize that this issue is prevalent in a lot of anime, not just SAO, but it is an issue in SAO regardless. 
A large part of what I find disappointing about SAO is how amazing some of its aspects genuinely are. The music is great. It really sells the MMO vibes of the world. The soundtrack obviously takes heavy inspiration from music of the middle ages that other MMOs were inspired from. The Western European influences are seen everywhere from imagery to the designs but most prevalent in the music where emphasis is placed on instruments such as the flute and other wood instruments. However SAO blends together aspects of Contemporary music quite well with electronic sort of breakcore elements. Curve this with a healthy mix of Classical, seasonal and new age and you have a great OST. One thing I love about this OST is the use of the more orchestral sounds, epic symphonies which heighten a lot of the scenes but also hide some of the more indiscriminate flaws within the series. The music made me reminisce a lot about the video game OST I loved in the past; the ones that came to mind were that of Lineage II and Morrowind (basically the whole Elder Scrolls series). Even more memorable about the music in SAO is the great opening themes. Lisa is a GOAT, I love her music and Crossing Field is just such a banger. It’s one of those songs that gets stuck in your head for days with one of the catchiest choruses I’ve heard. The ED Yume Sekai by Haruka Tomatsu is straight fire, a really relaxing song to chill too. The visuals actually give me Durarara vibes which I thought was cool. On the topic of sound, SFX. WOW, this anime has good SFX. Just like map design in video games SFX in anime largely goes unnoticed. That's because it's not meant to be noticed, and you only notice it when it's bad. However the SFX in SAO are genuinely great, they perfectly fit the MMO vibe. The way objects glitch and how button presses sound fit the setting to a tee. The voice acting is nothing to write home about, but none of the performances were bad. In fact the vast majority of the vocal performances In SAO are pretty good. Yoshitsugu is inoffensive at worst and pretty good at best and Haruka Tomatsu is always good at playing female leads so I have no problems with any of the vocal performances from the cast here. 
I hope that this point has been abundantly pointed out by now, but SAO was a series that in theory had a lot going for it. Stellar production, a fairly large budget, a good concept at the peak of its relevance and a flurry of talented staff members working on the clock to produce the best anime they can. So where the hell did it all go wrong? It’s my belief that at the crux of the issue - the foundation for all of the negative aspects in SAO; it's the characters. 
SAO may have had a strong start story wise, but from the get go I knew that Kirito was going to be a boring character. Which at the start, was fine. A lot of good plots have tapered over poor characters, especially if that plot is interesting enough to keep me watching. But as it became abundantly clear that the story of SAO was not going to improve at all, it pushed the burden of the show mainly on the cast. SAO might possibly have the flattest most lifeless ensemble of characters I have ever seen. Starting off hot Kirito is a shit character, there really is no better adjective to explain how much I dislike Kirito. Kirito sort of perfectly fits that whiney “Everyman” archetype, the typical teenage boy. Kirito is 100% a self insert character who’s appeal comes from the fact that you could literally be him, which to be honest, is something I’m fine with. A lot of anime have weak Male leads which are usually carried by a great supporting cast (SAO is not one of those shows but I digress). Kirito also happens to be an overpowered “badass”, I say that in quotations because it is the weakest attempt at trying to make a character look cool at all. It's like Reki really wanted to make Kirito like Guts or Alucard without realizing the appeal of either character. Kirito doesn't have a quarter of the depth Guts has as a character and not even an inch of the badass nature of Alucard. Kirito is a childish attempt at creating a “cool” character whilst also attempting to have the same depth as characters like Guts or Spike Spiegel. I think the most egregious part for me about Kirito’s writing has to be the lack of inspiration, Kirito is not a character, rather a random string of character traits like his entire personality was taken from the spark notes of a middle schooler. The same goes for the supporting cast. Asuna is by far the best character in the entire series, that's not me saying she’s well written or even engaging but she is the best character. She has a strong personality, gets shit done, doesn't whine and by all means is the most practical character in the first half of the show (not in the second half but I’ll talk about that later). She’s as 2D dimensional as it gets and her introduction is some of the edgiest shit i’ve ever seen but genuinely she carried the first half of this series; and it shows, she’s definitely the most popular of the female leads, even if the MAL stats say Kirito is more popular I would wager that Asuna is the more popular character. The rest of the cast is just so asinine and unimportant it's hard to write anything of significance about any of them, I could write a whole essay on the cast of MMO Junkie or even Overlord. SAO is simply overshadowed in every way by its successors and it shows in the casts lack of anything. A supporting cast should help push the plot forward whilst also showing off  aspects of the leads, that doesn't mean that they should be completely ignored. You need to give some, even equal parts attention to the stories of the supporting characters, not none at all. 
I know it's gonna be weird hearing this from me after I just committed arson on top of the SAO grave but the first part of SAO isn’t just the best part of the whole series, but I actually enjoy watching it. To put it simply, it's pretty fun. What I mean by that is that it’s easy to watch. Sometimes, even with anime I really like, I find it hard to get past certain episodes, or I find the content too heavy to get through. I didn’t have any of those troubles whatsoever with SAO, that's because it's easy to consume. But credit where credit is due, it's hard to stop watching SAO once you start and that definitely gives the show some merit.
~PART 2 : Alfheim Arc~
Now, think about every positive thing I said about the characters and story in the Aincrad arc and throw it into a heaping dumpster fire. Alfheim, even by long time fans of the series, is regarded as the worst arc in the entire series, and for good reason. It's asinine, boring and probably one of the worst arcs in anime history. If the first part of SAO was a breeze to get through, Alfheim is like walking through a mile of thick sewerage in Shawshank prison. 
The Alfheim arc picks up right where the Aincrad arc left us (around 2 months later). It mainly explores Kirito’s struggles readjusting to life back in the real world and explores how his relationship with Asuna is progressing. And by progressing I mean that Asuna is now stuck in a Coma and being kept alive in another VR game where she needs to be rescued; there's this creepy Jared Leto looking fuck face licking her and shit (and thats the least creepy thing he does) saying hes going to marry Asuna and its all one big mess. To be honest, I don't mind this setup. It’s a fairly logical progression of the plot, it sets up some decent stakes, gives us a time limit and a potentially interesting new area to explore. However Things pretty much instantly derail from the second episode onwards. Alfheim suffers from one of the biggest issues in the media. It happens in a lot of games, movies and books. Alfheim suffers from the age old question of “Why” or more commonly “What the fuck is the point of any of this”. So much of what happens in the Alfheim arc doesn’t contribute in any way to the ultimate goal of the series. At some point you start to wonder if Kirito even gives a shit about his Wife since he spends half of his time dicking around with the most pointless things. Everything to do with salamanders and the clan leaders is completely inane. The plot spends far too much time on drivel that doesn't amount to anything when It could be spending that time forwarding the main story, or even exploring some of the more important sub stories; Such as the incest one. Yeah I’m not joking. Apart from the fact that it's only there to fulfill a very strange Brother Sister fantasy thing (you know the whole step bro meme that goes around) it's just not very well written and really creepy. The worst part is that given a more competent writer the incest sub plot could have actually been interesting. But when it's put in perspective of the entire series and the context of the creation of SAO, it feels as though it's there to appeal to a very creepy fantasy. One thing that I touched on in the first part is Reki’s tendency to cover more taboo themes. If you thought it was bad in the first arc, then you haven't seen how bad it gets in the second one. The use of rape in the Alfheim arc doesn't teter on sexist, it straight up is. I find it genuinely revolting seeing Asuna get straight up sexually assualted in some of the most ridiculous ways just to add insult to injury. The Tentacle rape scene is almost comical, if it wasen’t for the fact that she’s getting raped; at best this scene is Softcore porn at its worst its straight up hentai. Which would be fine if it was a Hentai, or even an ecchi. What I find so infuriating about all of this is that Reki Kawahara so desperately wants to make it look shocking and mature but it ends up looking juvenile and disappointing. Rape is a very touchy subject and for it to be used to carelessly is really disappointing. But it gets worse. The scene where Sugo tears Asuna’s clothes off and nearly rapes her is far too excessive. I’m all for adult and shocking content so long as it has merit but the Rape scenes here are just so unnecessary. I don’t want my critiques of these scenes to be the only reason I dislike the Alfheim arc as I think even with these scenes removed it's a massive disappointment. But It’s so hard to get over the egregious over sexualization in this Arc. If you think I’m disappointed by this story, I am far more disappointed by the use of Sexual assualt in these scenes. 
Nothing much of the characters has changed apart from some new forgettable faces and the total destruction of any positive character traits these people had. Kirito went from an Overpowered edgy teenager to an even more edgy and overpowered teenager. I’m all for cool guys who kick ass and never lose but Kirito has to be the most annoying one. God can only know how he can be so gifted at everything he does, that he can play a game for literally a weak and be better than literally everyone. If I thought he was annoying in Aincrad then Alfheim only made it worse. Asuna got the short end of the stick too. She went from the best character in the series to a typical damsel in distress (sort of like a Kabenari situation with Mumei). They decided to bring back Yui, for god knows what reason. And they introduced it to a bunch of people who don’t matter. I couldn’t tell you a single interesting thing apart from their good or their bad. Sugo is a shitty villain from a writing standpoint and also from a moral standpoint. He's probably the most cartoonish villain in the entire series sporting the most maniacal evil lip licking in any anime ever. Suguha has a strange incentuous relationship with her older brother and I hate everything about these characters. 
~Conclusion~
It Could be better. But It could also be a whole lot worse. A lot of people really don't like this anime, and it's fair enough not to, I don’t care for it much myself. But to the people that blindly hate everything about this series and write it off as pointless drivel, I implore you to give it a rewatch, you might find some actual merit. I know it may seem like I just spent 4000 words completely shitting on this anime but I do genuinely feel like it has been thrown to the wayside for the wrong reasons.
Thank you for reading.",5

                SAO where to begin with the main characters personality and looks your first thought is probably wow I think he's a total badass...and your probably right as well. With kirito as the main character of this anime he totally boosted the shows popularity by a lot. With him doing depth defying stunts like soloing a boss and bringing out a new skill or overcomeing death in the game by useing sheer will power. With him as the hero he moves the story along and it would be kind of boring with out him. On the other hand you have ausana who is also a key
                  character in this anime as well. With out her there would be three episodes gone right there as well or when she takes kiritos blow to chest and dies. If it wasn't for that kirito wouldn't have been able to over come the nervgear using his will power. All in all she was a good heroine but the thing that sets me off about this anime is the huge time lapses in the game. It jumps from floor 2 to 25 to 56 to 76 and then were done. With all that space in there there could have been atleast 10 seasons all based on each 10 floors of the castle. This would have made a way better anime than it is now, but then the art would be sloppier than the stunning work of art it is now. So do you really think there should have been this huge time gap in the anime? I think there shouldn't have because although the manga is exactly like this producers change anime form the manga all the time. I say they would have made more profit from doing this than what they already have done. I'm not saying I hated it though I loved every bit of it from the sound track to the characters I just think they should have made it longer instead of takeing long bits of the anime and makeing it a Swiss Cheese anime. All in all I would give it a 7.75.",8

                Sword Art Online was the first anime series I watched. I hadn't grown up with anime and didn't understand the appeal of animated shows as my friends did, so I came into watching SAO with little to no expectation. Fortunately, I was unaware at the time of the extreme overhype this series had built up from its novels, so I was able to watch each episode without bias, which definitely impacted my opinion of the series.
In concept, being stuck in a video game isn't too far from the reality of many teenagers these days. I have immersed myself in numerous game environments previously, so I
                  can relate to the addiction, the intensity, the drive and motivation to be the best, the feelings of loss and depression, and the satisfaction of feeling alive in a fantasy world.
Did A-1 accurately capture the emotional turmoil of being stuck in a game? Yes. Did the series develop characters based on their real-life personalities rather than their in-game personas? Yes. Both of these aspects I found rather appealing, because they helped SAO become a more relatable and realistic scenario to a certain demographic of online gamers.
Then why is the story rated a 5/10? I actually appreciated the quick pacing of the first couple of episodes, because gamers tend to naturally learn to think and adapt on the fly, meaning that this demographic would be able to fully understand the introduction of the plot and its characters without missing a beat. However, I felt as if the story transitioned from point A to point B with a dramatic tone, rather than one of desperation. Considering that the introduction led me to believe that escape from the ""death game"" was the main objective of Kirito's quest, I was definitely disappointed by the multiple episodes that focused solely on side-quests. Given, these tangent episodes did add to the plot through the introduction of new characters; however, in a story with such an extreme binary ending (life vs. death), I believe screen time would have been better used as a sort of Kirito POV rather than, for example, showing a scene on floor 20 before skipping ahead to floor 47 with little to no explanation of the journey through those 27 unseen floors.
One of SAO's strong features came in its soundtrack. Yuki Kajiura gave us a wide variety of colorful pieces and battle themes that accented the drama of the series quite nicely. Initially, I found the composition to be a tad lethargic, mainly because I kept hearing the same elements used over and over from piece to piece, even in contrasting game environments, which bothered me. However, as the series progressed, the sound director did a phenomenal job of weaving ""uncomfortable"" pieces into scenes full of uncertainty and drama, which spiced up the scenes that A-1 wanted viewers to notice. Considering that the majority of the series took place in either towns or dungeons, Kajiura wasn't given too much freedom in exploring different musical themes, which hindered the potential of the series quite noticeably.
Overall, I found Sword Art Online to be very hit-or-miss from demographic to demographic. I enjoyed the SAO setting much more so than ALO, and I would have loved to have seen an increased focus on the main characters clearing the game rather than living in the game. The contrast between main characters and supporting roles was unfortunately only noticeable in screen time and not by difference in personality, which I believe contributed to the show's inconsistency from arc to arc. However, as a fantasy-meets-reality concept, I felt that A-1 executed the ""death game"" element as well as needed to make the anime seem relatable and believable from a gamer's point of view. Was SAO a good anime? Perhaps not. But I believe its positive elements were strong enough to warrant a re-watch.",7

                Beautiful and engaging, this series makes you see and think what some might do if trapped in a world where life is safe only if you engage the dangers that surround you. The main characters in this story pull at your heart strings as they struggle to escape this trap of epic proportions. Action, suspense, life, death, and love, this story keeps you hanging on every plot twist and turn, making you want more. I hope to see what challenges Kirito and Asuna overcome if they continue the series as far as the manga progressed.

                A much better take on the ""trapped in an mmo"" idea than the .hack series. The first arc was very enjoyable. The introduction to the characters and their predicament is well done and the continuing struggles of Kirito are interesting. The second arc was basically garbage as Asuna goes from formidable ally to helpless damsel in distress while Kirito's story focuses mostly on his strange relationship with his (not) sister. The third arc was once again excellent while the fourth arc is the worst of the lot.
IMO they should have extended SAO to 25 episodes and made season two 25 episodes of GGO.
Watch the first
                  season. Skip the second season. Watch the third season. Skip the fourth season. Profit.",7

                *CONTAINS SPOILERS*
Hey! You like MMORPG games such as Runescape and league of legends? Well, why not try sword art online! The only MMORPG where dumbass underage girls fall for this generic but overpowered piece of shit! Try SAO today! (WARNING: You won't be guaranteed to get anime Waifus, the only one getting that shit is ya boi Kirito The Hoe Stealer.)
Story: 1/10
I'm sure lots of people can agree that the premise of SAO is pretty cool, But the way it's executed is by having an overpowered character, lots of Harem, and Players acting like there is no death or alive scenario.
The first episode is well
                  done at showing you the premise of Sword Art Online. 
Fast forward to the second episode, Kirito Murdures a Monster with the ""Power of Friendship"" after the death of a character that just got introduced. It's crazy how the Writers expect you to care about the passing of a guy that was presented in the same episode, and this problem seems to be happening a lot on Sword Art Online, because fast forward to episode 3, The same darn thing happens when some retarded hoe with no personality passes away. How can you care about a character you haven't grown to love or one who existed for like 5 minutes?! Thankfully, this problem didn't happen on the 4th episode, but what did happen is a problem that just made me drop this thing. 
A young girl gets introduced by having her scream ""Pina"" for literally 5 minutes. The girl gets (of course) saved by Kirito. Kirito accepts to help her on a journey because She is just like his ""little sister"", I repeat, He feels like she is just like his l i t t l e  s i s t e r, Welp, Kirito's ""little sister"" falls in love with him, and if that isn't worst, they also showed that underage girl without her shirt n' pants. Welp, better drop this shit because I sure as hell know where this whole anime is gonna go! What next? Kirito marries Asuna as clearly shown on the Opening, or maybe He survives the game considering how OP this man is, or maybe he gets more hoes on his small PP, or maybe he steals every hoe on the planet, or maybe the FBI finally finds him?
Honestly, I ain't gonna waste my time watching some overpowered piece of shit getting hoes and underage girls, What I'm gonna do is call Kirito's damn parents because boi Santa is gonna give him some actual real shit for how naughty this little BOI is. 
SAO, the first anime I've ever dropped! Although I might continue for self torture.
Art: 7/10
If It looks good, then it's not very good, nor great, nor outstanding, what it actually is: good. 
7/10 g o o d.
Sound: 7/10
Good. The opening is amazing and the voices are alright.
Characters: 1/10
The worst. You got the overpowered retarded piece of shit, The dumbass retarded girls who always fall in love with the overpowered retarded piece of shit. One guy that was decent is Ryoutarou but man this boi had no screen time I legit forgot he existed.
Enjoyment: 1/10
I don't enjoy harem, I enjoy comedy, and this shit has none. They missed an opportunity to implement comedy much like One Punch Man where the whole anime is joking about how overpowered the main character is, but that didn't happen, what happened is harem shit.
Overall: 3/10 
This anime sucks doodoo water, and I don't like seeing an anime sucking doodoo water, so I stop watching the damn thing sucking doodoo water! and hopefully you will too!",3

                Truthfully, Sword Art Online had it's flaws; and could have been much more successful with the potential of the first first episodes. Typically I tend to stray away from main-stream popular animes because they don't typically live up to my expectations. HOWEVER, when I first began the series; in the first few episodes I was extremely hooked. In fact, I was until the end of the series.
 But honestly the flame did die out after episode 14. Alfheim Arc was no where near successful as the Aincrad Arc, but I mean thats expected with any second-part series. 
Overall, I believe Aincrad could have been stretched
                  into a much longer storyline and I would've still been interested. From one episode to another, it moves between months of time and I believe much more could've been added in between. Aincrad Arc deserves a 9.5/10. 
As for Alfheim Arc, this was much less enjoyable but I still couldn't put the series down. I believe this was stretched possible too long, and could've been wrapped up much quicker to give Aincrad some more development time. It just personally didn't live up to expectations after the Aincrad Arc; and I felt as if the writers were just 'adding it in'. However it was still enjoyable. 7.5/10.",9

                This show is basically a highlight reel of what's wrong with isekai and all the cliches in the genre.
It starts out with a really interesting premise. A good situation for a story, a semi-interesting MC, factions, chaos, it was a good start up. After about 4 episodes it all went to shit.
The interesting main plot was rushed to a degree that it was obvious that they didn't know what to do with it or didn't care about it. It picked up cliche harem vibes (and even incestual vibes halfway thru S1). The love story was somewhat shoehorned but cute for the most part and gave
                  us the best side-story with the little girl. The poor rating hinges mostly on the fact that everything good, the interesting main plot, the MC being hated for being a beta-tester, all gets abandoned very easily. We're left with a rushed story, an overpowered MC who just becomes annoying, and an unconvincing love story.
The first major arc, which again was incredibly rushed and would've made good for an entire series itself, was brought to an unfulfilling asspull ending. Then the poor love story was continued as the main plot of the second half of the season in the most irritating, unrealistic way. To sum it up (minor spoilers) the driving force of the 2nd season is that MC's love interest isn't woken up after the end of SAO like everyone else, and in her sleep her marriage is arranged (in the 21st century) with a guy who puts her in a literal birdcage in another game.
tl;dr good premise, terribly executed.",5

                Great Anime! I enjoyed this anime a lot was fun to watch and keep me interested almost the entire time. I tend to have a habit of watching one anime as soon as possible to the very end of it. With this anime i had no problem with that as time flew by and before i knew it the anime was already over and had me thirsting for more.
Pros: Great storyline and character developments really enticing and addicting. The battles are pretty cool and have you rooting for the home team! :) Romance is present but still good action within the anime; best of both
                  worlds. 
Cons: Ending just makes you want more of this anime. Really fast anime really makes you wish it was longer.
Other: Not really in depth with graphics or audio as i just started watching anime, but i'd say this uses good of both.
Overall:Great Anime wish there was more!
Recommend: Definitely, for those who are looking for Fantasy, Action, and Romance definity a great anime to watch. Especially if you're into online gaming like myself.

                i am writing this to give my thoughts and i mean no hate ( i mean i kinda do)
I started SAO for 2 reasons
1: my friend begged me to 
2: i wanted to see how bad it was for my self
Well here we go
Chapter 1, characters:
well overall the characters suck major balls with 3 good characters at most
witch all get around 20 minutes of screen time each and barley any linesthe mc Kirito is bland and has no real stakes since hes op in every game,
Asuna is bland annoying and worst girl shes built like this ""i'm a strong independent women"" type but almost every season shes needs saving scratch that every episode the villains are so sub par my 8 year old brother has made up better villains with his legos they all have no real motivation and there just there to be ""bad"".
Chapter 2, story:
Can i even call this a story its so bland and i get that it was before the isakei bloom but still
the amount of times the writer just says fuck it Kirito wins this one guys you see everything coming there are no stakes since Kirito has not lost once ever, theirs also no consistency for example Eugeo who shows up later in the shows gets his eye poked out and he just gets it healed, like the writer just undoes the bad things that happen.
Chapter 3 art/animation:
I will give this show a little credit for its nice sakuga at moments but most of the show is basic and non applying.
Chapter 4 game design: 
i dont want to drag this out so i recommend watching
(Mothers basement) ""why SAO is a terrible game, Too
Chapter 5 Final Thoughts:
shitty show dont waste your time also forgot to mention there is a few rape scenes and incest :)",4
"
                Story: decent concept, done absolutely horribly, it started off pretty interesting but literally an episode after I was
Contemplating that maybe people are being way to hard on the series, it drops in quality quite quickly, so many things don't make sense at all in the story and it is filled with time skips and pacing is way too fast, 2/10
Art and animation: not gonna lie, it is absolutely banging, fight scenes are really good, art is really good, 9/10
Sound: sound fits this anime really well and it is extremely well done in general, op and ending are both some of the best I have ever
                  heard 9/10
Characters: probably the worst thing about the show, every character is horrible, kirito is the worst mc I have ever seen in fiction, they try so hard to make him look like a badass but honestly he is just a dickhead, for starters he shows multiple times that he is a simp for asuna, secondly he is a massive asshole (spoiler alert: in episode 2 everybody joins in to defeat a boss, but the person that led the attack dies, kirito was a beta tester so he knew how to beat the boss but he didn't tell the others how to do so, but someone finds out that he is a beta tester and calls him out for not telling the others how to beat the boss and his excuse is ""I was the best beta tester everybody else was trash"" and he was holding back majorly, if he used more of his power and told people how to defeat the boss then nobody would have died), thirdly he is extremely oblivious, it is like he forgot he is in a life/death situation and he is still playing a game, asuna treats kirito like shit but the pacing was to fast so she barely got character development, the rest of the cast barely make an impact so they aren't worth talking about but most are really bland characters, it is a 1/10 but +1 for having an non stereotypical black guy that is surprisingly a decent character (though not being in the show that much)
Enjoyment: 5/10, I want to say I didn't enjoy the anime, but fight scenes and humour keep me from doing that, but other than those two I hated watching this, so I'm dropping it",2

                THIS REVIEW IS FOR ALL THE SAO HATERS CAUSE BOI... I WAS ONE OF YOU UNTIL NOW
Just to point it out SAO was my first anime that i watch back when i was in the Last Year of Middleschool 5 years ago.
SAO opened the gates to anime for me, however as i grow older i saw the flaws in it's plot and characters
I see that SAO could have been better and so i started hating on the fact, thinking that someday it would be what i envisioned it to be.
However that is just not the case, the fact of the matter is you can't change
                  a writers story and he created SAO to  ENTERTAIN the watchers because SAO is meant for all ages. Thats why when i watch SAO for the very first time and as my very first anime i was ENTERTAINED, i was hooked by the art and as you say an OP character that gets boobs and women is my kinda style for a middle-school gamer student.
It made me Entertained and made me enjoyed SAO, however as i grew older around mid High-school, I re-watch the anime reminiscing the first anime i watched and seeing the plot and character as dull as paper it made me Angry and Mad as to what it COULD HAVE BEEN making me a hater.
But as of now I manage to see both sides of the spectrum and I for once came to a good conclusion that SAO isn't as bad as i usually said. But SAO is an ENTERTAINING anime to watch without thinking. It's the anime where my middle-school self got hooked and enjoy because of it's easy to understand narrative thats dull and enjoyable sound and art. Its just a anime to watch and go, you dont need any discussions no forums no debates no nothing.
I had enough discussions of how SAO is bad and everyone shouldn't watch it VS SAO is the best anime and everyone should watch it. It's just an anime for you to just Chill and enjoying the ENTERTAINMENT that it provides. 
For me i could remember 5 years ago that i really enjoyed the anime to the point that i become an otaku. It opened me to a culture that i haven't experienced before and so i shouldn't be hating on it yet grateful.
For reference even the creator Reki Kawahara, decided to remake the plot of SAO by creating Sword Art Online: Progressive. I read the manga and i enjoyed the plot better, however SAO as it is i could score it as the following:
Story : 3 (Storywise it's paper)
Art : 7 (Art is good at the time)
Sound : 8 (Sound is Great, loved the OP and battle soundtrack)
Character : 4 (Characters are a bit dull and generic)
Enjoyment : 7 (I enjoyed the anime for what it have given which is ENTERTAINMENT)
Overall : 6 ( It's an OK anime)
For all thing considered im not a SAO Hater nor a SAO lover, i just enjoy the anime for it's worth and i believe i didn't waste any of my time watching SAO if you open your mind.
If you want to watch SAO, watch it. Be my guest, i won't argue or discuss anything about the plot i'm now just enjoying the ENTERTAINMENT it provides. Everyone differs and overall it's not a bad show if you see it in an ENTERTAINMENT point of view like me. It's no longer what i consider a sh!t show but more of a enjoy it for what it delivers that what you want it to deliver.",6

                SAO (Sword Art Online) scored very highly for me as an anime however there are some hiccups. First I believe that they could have taken more time to show the progression of time and develop the characters a little more. The first few episodes took place over a few weeks which was understandable. The randomly they jumped a few months into the future then even further after that. One episode shows them going to a new place for 2-4 days then they're called back to the front lines and the guy says its been 3 months! 
The story is mostly original. I say mostly cause
                  the whole being trapped in a videogame has happened in anime (Dot Hack), movies (Tron), and other media (Dot Hack and Tron are just 2 random examples) but the way they went about it was very original. 
Some of the filler episodes are frankly useless while others really show you why the main character is the way he is (pity they didn't do that for some of the other main characters) The main problem with the story is that it focuses too much around the main character and jumps around the time line far too much.
All that being said I loved the anime and would definitely play the game if it were real. Some stuff in it made no sense at all though. Taking someones sword to fight an enemy for example when they didn't give permission or even know it was happening. ""But that's what pickpocketing is!"" I hear people typing sarcastically and they're right. Taking an item that doesn't belong to you from someone else is a pickpocketing skill that is in a lot of games like that. However out of all the games I've played I've only ever played one where you could steal the item they actually had equipped. 
Think the main complaint I have is for the second season/part/whatever you wanna call it. It kinda felt like they were just pushing it through for the sake of doing so. ""Oh I can give you enough money to suit up most your army with Ancient class items? (Guessing that's epic level in wow give or take) Alright take all my money, I'll just continue to use this random sword. (guessing to be around a green level sword in wow). The first part was awesome and it has a great re-watch value and all and all I would say the anime as a whole was almost a masterpiece...almost. I believe if they made the anime longer even with a few filler episodes or some bouncing back and forth, make it 2 seasons for the 2 different games other then just 1 longish one it would have been a masterpiece. However beggars can't be choosers and over all I would recommend this anime for at least a one time watch to see how you enjoy it.",8
"
                Let me start off by saying wow.... This anime was amazing. The action. The love. The intensity. The movement of the entire show! ALL OF IT....JUST BEAUTIFUL! I would have to say this is one of my highest ranked shows because of all those factors but....here's my review on WHY exactly it was what it was.
Story: EASY 10.
The story is mostly about this MMO that people are trapped inside of and this one character decides to go on a journey to solve this problem. That's it in a nutshell. But what I really like about the story is its originality. I have yet to see
                  another anime that dealt with Games and treated it like life and death. That was really mind blowing. Second thing is how they started the show....awesome. they went right into the whole you're gonna die theme which made everything very well played out. Its cool how they brought in many characters throughout the anime but they mostly focused on about 2. Third, they included FEELINGS as in emotions throughout. Now I know a lot of anime that played with emotions like Clannad and Elfen Lied but this one was really the go-getter. It incorporated tons of emotions. I felt connected to the characters all the way but ill say why later. And lastly, the ending... this was by the most satisfying of all anime. I had no questions left at the end because they were all answered. No hangs or anything. And tbh...I think that's what made this so great...all of it.
Art: 10
I liked the art a lot. It showed expression, action, and depth. The creativity was there and it proved itself to be worthy of such a great review. The expressions were mezmerizing and the action...oh the action....best parts of the show. Everytime you saw an explosion or a rush, you felt engaged and running along side the character. It was splendid. 
Sound: 10
I like a lot of OST's but this one is sure to be memorable. Both of them. I think the first one is a bit better but still....both good. The action scene sounds were great too. Nothing felt off or anything.
Now this is where its fun...
Character: 10
Since you spend all your time trying to get to know Kirito you begin to be, feel, and even act like him. All his emotions portrayed during the anime relay onto you. The character building is there and doesn't stop throughout. Every character is quite memorable too.
Enjoyment: 10
Overall I felt this anime was a beauty. Idk what could've been better in the show. With everything that was shown during this anime its hard to say that it wasn't the least bit entertaining. It really kept you on edge and if you decide to not watch this anime....then you're a fool.",10
"
                This show features all the worst tropes an anime could possible feature. It is masturbatory male power fantasy with a giant harem of girls fawning over the main character's video game skills.
What if I could live in an mmo
what if everyone was FORCED to play it with me
what if i was the chosen one
what if women were amazed about me being the chosen one
It is basically your dream. But is that necessarily a good story? In this reviewers opinion, the answer is no. The only original idea in this show is the setting where a lot of people are stuck inside a virtual reality mmorpg,
                  and it honestly doesn't play that large apart of the story. Sure they talk about it all the time, but the mmo is set in a generic fantasy universe, so the anime is basically set in a generic fantasy universe too.
However, I must admit, I do think every single trope of anime is in this somewhere, so if you only care about watching the same retired stuff over and over, this may be a show for you. There is a cute girl with a pet, there is a pervert male sidekick, there is casual incest, every woman in the story serves the purpose of damsel in distress for the main character to save, there is a way too long Ross and Rachel like love story which only culminates into a kiss (I am not saying it should be a hentai, but at least implying a sexual relationship seems appropriate at some point), and don't worry, there are plenty of filler episodes to explore each and every single one of these bland ideas.
I guess the art is good. It is not very artistic, but it seems to have an okay budget, so they have a lot of animated action sequences, which I guess is cool.
Other than the art, the story gets the highest score from me. Just pure power fantasy is actually a very popular story, which you will meet in a lot of pop culture, it is just not for me. 
When I watch shows and anime I like at least some kind of originality, and not just a ""wouldn't it be cool if a girl was forced to play video games with me""",2
"
                I was just scrolling through all the reviews, and found something most with worse ratings had in common: the lack of character and plot development. I completely agree that the plot of SAO may be very simple, the characters have not too great a personality and the general feeling about it can be almost stifling at times. 
But, I think you might just be trying to pool all anime into one. Some claim that an anime needs an in depth plot, twisted and interesting characters and the that you get an orgasmic feeling whenever you watch it. The thing is, that's wrong. 
Not all anime
                  are made with the intent of being a well thought-through masterpiece of creation. Some are here for mere entertainment: In this case, SAO. All the aforementioned parameters may be shallow, clearly predictable and so on. But that doesn't matter! It's still a fun series to watch. I had a great time while watching it. And I'd say everyone could get a kick out of it if you would just concentrate on enjoying the show, and not constantly think ""Oh, Kirito's such a dickhead for doing xyz"" and so on. 
It can be fun, it can be cool, and it can be entertaining. Just remember that not all anime were created with the same intention. 
With that in mind, go watch it, and have a blast!",7
"
                There's a saying that often goes around in music production, that goes like this:
""Mastering a bad song is like polishing a turd. Yeah, it'll look nice, but it's still a turd.""
Sword Art Online, in this case, is the turd.
The first few episodes actually do a pretty good job of pulling you into the series, despite Kirito being utterly inept the second he has to be social. Yeah, there's not a terrific amount of depth in the story, but it looks & sounds nice. There are some seriously wallpaper-level moments in the first few episodes.
As the series progresses, though, that lack of depth becomes actively angering,
                  as it shows up in pretty much everything the show does. Those narrative shortcomings that were relatively easy to gloss over before become glaringly obvious as the show goes on, with clear logical solutions to problems being completely ignored over & over again for reasons I can't even hope to explain.
It's shocking to me how many missteps this show takes in terms of its plot, especially in the 2nd half of this season. The pacing ranges from ""snail stuck in molasses"" to ""wait, it's already done?"", and can flip between either of those extremes without a moment's notice. They take needless detours from the story for seemingly no reason at all other than to pad that 25 episode run-time, and basically don't even bother trying to justify them.
It almost felt like they were trying to make a terrible story, but couldn't find the self-awareness or the humour that makes some of those bad works worth watching.
All this without even mentioning that Kirito is basically God when it comes to skill at both games in the series (is that a spoiler? Eh, it's not like it's some gut-wrenching twist). The second of the two games adds a new element to the combat - flight. And somehow, after spending 2 full years in a game where flight didn't exist, not to mention that little thing called real life, he's able to completely master it in basically 5 minutes. 
""Best Player in the Game"" as your opponent? No problem, Kirito the Video Game God is here to help. Doesn't matter if it's Call of Duty or Tetris, he has you covered. Now THAT would be an anime I'd watch (if they made it a comedy). Unfortunately, they don't take this angle and end up seriously saying that Kirito can take on the best player in a game he picked up a week ago.
And that kind of encapsulates my thoughts on the series in general - it sounds like it should be a parody with the things that happen in the show, but it plays all of those situations completely straight.
Basically the only thing I enjoyed about the plot (well, relative to the rest of the season anyway) was the romance portion (so it was a GREAT idea to basically reduce half of that relationship to a damsel in distress - and other spoiler-related stuff that's frankly disgusting - for the second half of the season!), but even that was done better in the Abridged version (it's on Youtube, go watch it - it seriously turns this into a 9/10), as is pretty much everything else.
If you want a dumb, good looking anime & don't really care about a good story with memorable characters or any sane decision-making, the first half of Sword Art Online is for you.
If you want the exact same thing, but this time entirely unnecessary in pretty much everything it does, then the second half is for you. I just hope you know what you're doing when you're watching this.
I wanted to like Sword Art Online so badly. It looked and sounded great in the first couple episodes, and I've always been a fan of this kind of premise.
But, as with the turd, looks can be deceiving. No matter how much you polish it, it's still just a turd.",3
"
                This is my first time writing a review so please don’t judge Sword Art Online known as SAO is quite good has a good story / plot to it ill sum it up to you in my own words. It’s about this kid name Kirito-kun that’s his game name he got to play the beta for SAO only a thousand are picked and when the game comes out for SAO all the players get teleported to the 1st floor and are told by the GM that you cannot log out of this game and if you die in the game you die in real life
PROS:
                  Very good story, Voice actors were great I liked them, 
Read: this is all on my opinion you will see it different in your eyes 
Cons: Don’t finish it in 1 day",9
"
                I want to first of all say that Sword Art Online is perfect. I'd rate it a ten for every category, I'd recommend it to everyone in the world, and I'd go on record as saying that Sword Art Online is the single greatest anime ever made.
I want to say that. But I can't.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every second of watching the show and I wouldn't take back a bit of it, but I cannot justify giving it a ten. I can say it's a favorite of mine, but not my favorite. I can say I loved it, I can't say I adored
                  it. And the easiest way to explain this is as such:
Sword Art Online has some of the most psychologically perfect relationship dynamics I've ever seen. As such, every character was able to be identified with, and this led to me genuinely caring for everyone involved. Top that off with some outstanding action sequences and a surprisingly rewarding story, and you have what can be called a masterpiece in anime.... for fourteen episodes. 
Fairy Dance was not bad by any means, but it definitely killed a lot of momentum of the season, and definitely should've been its own thing. Having it in the same group as Aincrad made the whole show suffer as a result. If you're someone who's thinking about watching SAO, for any reason at all, all I have to say to you is this. If you think you'll like it, watch it, you will. If you aren't totally sure, watch Aincrad, then after that see if you want to finish. And if you're only watching it because a friend told you to, pretend that the show ends episode 14. You'll have much higher feelings for it.",9
"
                People who watched Sword Art Online can effectively be divided into two more or less uniform groups. The first being those who hype up this show to a ludicrous degree and claim it's one of the best things they've ever watched, won't stop talking about it, etc.
Secondly, you have the unique snowflake non-purpose hipsters who will spew out five generic paragraphs about how horrible SAO is and how you should feel bad for watching it because it's the worst anime to disgrace their screens at its mere mention.
I'm here to represent the ""middle ground"" between these two extremes. Simply put, SAO is not the best
                  thing I've ever watched; far from it. How ever, it's also a far cry from the worst. Let's take an in-depth look at each categroy to see why I feel this way. As they say in the show, ""Link...start!""
Oh, keep in mind, I will refrain from including Sword Art Online II in this review aside from a few minor comparisons I may need to make.
Story: 
I'm sure you all know the basic premise of SAO. A major MMORPG with full VR controls is released in the not-so-distant future of 2022. Everyone is having fun with it on launch day until they realize they can't log out. The game's creator appears to tell everyone that this is intentional and the only way to return to the real world is for someone to beat the game's main bosses. Attempting to exit the game any other way will fry the player's brain in the real world, and dying in the game will result in the same effect. Cue our main protagonist, Kirigaya Kazuto (known by his online gamertag, ""Kirito"") setting out to be the first to save everyone. 
Now, like most other Toonami faithful, I've watched .Hack, so the whole ""dudes playing an MMO"" thing isn't new or mindblowing to me, but even so, it seems like it'd set up for an interesting story. What we got instead was... a bit different than you'd expect. The story shoves most of the other cast aside to focus solely on Kirito and his various exploits. Though the show has its fair share of episodes/scenes full of action and making actual progress, there are an equal amount of segments that amount to introducing a new female character and having them instantly drop their panties at the sight of Kirito. Okay, not literally, but they do all fall for him at first sight, and it gets old fast. 
There are also a lot of scenes that are just talking and it comes off as needless fluff. There are also a good number of seemingly needless timeskips early on that got me really confused. Therefore, a lot of people tend to complain that SAO has awful pacing. While I agree that it isn't the best, you also have to look at the fact that it's only 25 episodes. The slower-paced scenes will come and go before you know it, and one way or another, progress will be made in due time. The second arc focuses on a different game entirely and again, feels a bit unnecessary, but it wasn't unwatchable. 
If I can praise anything here, it's the idea of the game itself. All the mechanics such as sword skills and switching seem very interesting and could be applied to a real game. I'd love it if someone actually made an online game out of SAO with its base mechanics. Watching this is what got me back into MMOs.
Art:
Most people will agree that the art and visuals are one of SAO's stronger points. Structures and landscapes are beautifully drawn and almost breathtaking to look at at times. Many of the game bosses are unique in design and cool to look at. Many of the fight scenes are masterfully animated and I felt like they were almost on-par with the likes of DBZ. It's particularly cool when Kirito, Asuna, Klein and the gang team up for a major battle and fight in sync.
I don't have many complaints here honestly. The characters themselves are drawn just fine, but most of them weren't incredibly eye-catching either. Ingame equipment such as Kirito's signature coat have unique designs compared to real MMOs.
Sound: Another strong point. There was hardly a single piece of music in the entire show that I didn't enjoy. The main opening, ""Crossing Field"" was one of the better ones in the soundtrack, and if you watch all the way to SAO 2, you'll hear the ending theme ""Shirushi"" is downright beautiful and tugs at my heartstrings. 
The voicing on the other hand... is a mixed bag. Normally I'm a staunch defender of English dubs, but this one definitely has its flaws. Kirito is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook (Eren Jaeger, Henry) who seems to voice every male anime protag the same. Many lines meant to be taken seriously during critical moments come out as cheesy and borderline humorous. No offense to the guy, but he could've at least tried to sound different here. On the other hand, I enjoyed Kirk Thornton's performance as Klein.
Character: 
Now we've reached what is sadly this show's weakest point. A good chunk of this show's cast has, to quote a friend of mine, ""the depth of a CapriSun container"". Our main hero, Kirito, is unfortunately the worst example. Kirito is a completely flawless hero who can overcome every obstacle the story throws at him without breaking a bead of sweat. He will win every battle because he's Kirito. I don't like to use the term ""Mary-Sue"" because it feels like dumb terminology made up by elitist fanfiction writers, but if you must, that's the best way to describe him. He gets every girl, all the best gear in the game, and at best, might pretend to struggle before he miraculously succeeds time and time again. And unfortunately this is the guy that will be hogging the spotlight for most of the adventure. 
Kirito definitely has his moments, but they're few and far between his flawless victories and this guy alone is the reason many people dislike SAO. The main female character, Asuna Yuuki, isn't much better, but she's also a more ""fun"" character, for lack of a better term. Without a doubt, my personal favorite character in the show is Klein. He's a ""noob"" player Kirito meets and befriends on the first day and shows up several times as the show progresses, getting stronger and forming his own guild. He's got significantly more to him than Kirito, and though he does get to participate in several major battles and do his part, he's mostly shoved to the side in favor of our main hero. He gets slightly more of a role in SAO 2 and I can definitely appreciate that. 
I didn't have much of an issue with the villains but I also don't have a lot to say about them. Kirito's sister Suguha wasn't very interesting to me and that's all I've got to say. Yui is the standard ""Moe"" character and probably my least favorite. Most of the other cast honestly isn't onscreen long enough for me to say much for either.
Enjoyment: 
At the very least, I can say I had fun watching SAO. I watched it in just a few sittings while I was ill and there weren't too many parts that made me outright want to turn it off and drop the series altogether. The visuals I mentioned earlier definitely pulled things together a bit better. Other than my earlier complaints, it's a fine anime for those looking for something short.
Overall: 
In conclusion, Sword Art Online is at the very least, decent. I feel like too many people view it in extremes, as either the best or the worst. Obviously I don't expect everyone to have the same opinion as me on it, but this isn't a show that people should be negatively criticized for enjoying. It's fine as something to watch ""on the side"" if you have other shows you prioritize more. If this show had a better protagonist, I think it'd get a lot less hate.",6
"
                I think this anime specifically gets a lot more flak and grief from the community then it deserves. This isn't to say this show is devoid of any issues, on the contrary, this show has many issues which bothered me. 
Using beer as an analogy, this show is akin to Budweiser (cheap American beer) when compared to more craft beers, as they tend to have more flavor and personality. As such, the mass market appeal of the show can't be ignored since its simple nature makes it easy to digest, especially for new members to the community.
 Breaking down each component (Story, Art/Sound, Characters, etc.):
*MAY
                  INCLUDE SPOILERS
Story: 
This was the part of the show I had the biggest issue with. A good story should be the driving force for watching the show and is what should keep you watching. While the story started out promising, it started to drop the ball soon after it started rolling. I liked the initial premise of the first 5 or 6 episodes, and I didn't mind the change of pace in the second half of that arc. However, the unnessecary timeskips were more disruptive than helpful. 
That being said, the second arc of the story is much, much worse than the first. It contributes little to the overall story, and only serves to hurt it. The change in each of the character roles undermines the development from the previous arc. I think the story would be much better if they removed this arc and used those episodes to further develop the first arc. 
Art/Sound: 
I think this is one of the few things that the show is known in a positive light for. The animation quality is absolutely beautiful and serves as a great backdrop to the series as a whole. The action scenes are also very well down, although possibly a bit over the top for some. Similar comments regarding the sound, as both the background music and the opening do a very good job of immersing you into the fantastical world in which SAO exists. It seems that A-1 studios can commit no crime when it comes to the production value of their shows. 
Characters:
The main issue that I had with the main characters are their lack of memorable character development throughout the course of the show. The main leads are prime example, as their characterization is simple, predictable, and boring. 
Overall:
While not entirely devoid of positive traits, this show has a lot of problems which bothered some people a lot more than others. I wasn't put off too terribly much, but enough that it prevented me from enjoying it to its full potential.
 Is the show absolutely horrible? No, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is more discerning of the shows they watch.",7

                As an MMORPG enthusiast myself, I found nothing lacking in Sword Art Online. This, as everyone knows, is an MMO player's dream, and in some cases worst nightmare. Anyone who has spent an unhealthy amount of time in front of a computer playing a game (for example... WOW) will appreciate this story. I have not read the novels so I cannot compare, however, I was hooked from the start.
The main character is your typical solo player, and he doesn't spend a lot of time on the social aspect of the game. He knows all of the ins and outs of leveling quickly, proper gearing, proper
                  farming, etc. (not to mention he was a beta tester for the game). The major event that starts this story is the inability to log out of the game (or remove the equipment for fear of death). Players trapped in the game have to deal with the psychological repercussions of their unfortunate situation. There are some side stories that may feel like they are not part of the overall progression, but they really are about establishing the culture and laying the groundwork for the relationships throughout. Most importantly, the side stories are about Kirito's (the main character) evolution as a more social player as he rises to be an unlikely hero despite his history and preference to go it alone. The bonds formed throughout the story are realistically forged (again speaking from experience, you try talking to an MMO nerd and you'll see what I am talking about). Some of the monotony is also part of the MMO culture, and they do a great job of minimizing the grind stuff (but you will see an instance or 2 of necessary item farming).
This series spans not 1 but 2 games, and it is quite simply an epic love story (did I forget this part earlier?) filled with adventure and some tragedy. There are times you will be a little disturbed, and there times that things may seem slow for those looking for a full on action adventure story. To those that are not familiar with the MMORPG culture, this may not be 100% for you. To those that are, you may see yourself in a blacksmith too afraid to fight on the front lines with the hard core raiders. You may be the young girl that was pressured into playing and now she's stuck. Maybe you're one of the hard core raiders or player killers. However you slice it, this is an accurate portrayal of an MMORPG PIE.
Long story short, this is an emotional tale about an unlikely hero, and it's a must see.",10

                I am not a new anime viewer, but for some reason I have never really got around to watching SAO which I almost feel is all the way up there with Death Note in popularity factors, and I’m mainly referencing that everyone has seen SAO, or recommends SAO. It’s the perfect hook for new anime watchers to seek more and more. However, in a way I was just totally turned off to watching gaming anime. 
When I finally did get around to it a few weeks ago eating and scouring Netflix I found SAO and realized I had skipped over it for so long it
                  obviously couldn’t hurt. I didn't know anything about it going in but without fail it was really original and addicting. Absolutely not one of the most AMAZING anime I’ve ever seen and especially since so many anime recently came out to compete with aged favorite I was sort of at best happily content with SAO. 
The anime itself has an outstanding art and sound style which was already a positive thing because if this anime was going to revolve around the concept of gaming it better have some good ass graphics and sound quality. The story concept was inventive and original with the realistic control of gaming taking over the player’s real life in a very literal way. The lack to this concept was the characters, in the beginning you know nothing about anyone and by the end it’s pretty much the same except for a few minor details that the series helped establish for you. Even if you read the plot description I was just kind of totally lost to the characters, and this was possibly due to the clichés of Kirito fighting alone and struggling with others about situations he realistically couldn’t control.  
Another main draw back of why someone might not like this series are the overtaking love circles, and while it didn’t do anything much to develop the character’s backstories or deeper delve into their personalities it wasn’t the worst part of the anime. Besides every story has to have a tad of romance otherwise you’re missing a huge chunk of audience you'd have otherwise. The bigger issues I had started appearing by the time the first season ended I was binging at this point to get to the second season with high hopes of something just as captivating. 
However, my hopes were smashed when binging turned into a forced rush to just get this series over with. 
I’m not even going to go into the many reasons why most popular anime’s trying to pull off a bomb ass second season aren’t worth it, but I’ll leave it at the characterization again. Still know very little to nothing about these characters I’m supposed to attach myself to mainly due to the game taking over, but in the second season when none of the original risks were there that wasn’t much to ask. The only other thing that I just NEED to complain about it the thrown in love triangle. 
It was an average and almost iffy twist for me that got my mind all fucked. His sister/cousin being in love with him isn’t a weird custom in Japan and it honestly wasn’t that weird for me out of all the messed up anime I’ve seen with direct siblings, but it was still unnecessary. It almost seemed like it was just throwing out this desperate filler and lack of creativity saying fuck it and when in doubt make it a harem. It felt like someone spit in my face after making the series center around this main love story and then twisting it to fuck everything up. Not only that but why the cousin/sister figure who's like his only reoccurring family. Like why not a new character to battle this existence of love that's honestly what pissed me off the most. Like if you aren't going to give me what I want give me something new. 
In conclusion, if you’re new to anime this is a must see because I feel like when starting you need a generic basis of what good anime is. Sure it’s not perfection but it’s enough to set you up to where you can appreciate the perfect anime a lot more. Also if you are like me and waited to watch it just go ahead and watch it because in the end it was a good anime and if you end up not liking it it’s not like the end of the world because not everyone has the same opinions or tastes.",8

                So here we are. It's the fairytaile dream fruture of every gamer out there, but like every fairytale, it's gotta have its sinistre twist to the story.
 Sword Art Online is one of those great anime that makes you wish you could step into the screen despite all the 'againsts' the plot might have, not only because it haves great graphics and characters but also because the story itself is quite enjoyable, especially for those who follow the novel.
 The first arc of the story (Aincard) is all about introduction, either be it characters, scenarios, main plot and I -personaly- thought it being very epic
                  and enjoyed it quite a lot. As for the second arc (Alpheim Online) the main plot get's a little blurred and the characters development slams it's way in and all the previous action is smothered by the romance-which doesn't necessarialy need to be a bad thing. The second arc -despite not being as trhilling as the first- was quite entusiastic, even though I must recommend to those of you who are or have watched the anime to read the novel, otherwise the second arc might feel little disapointing.
Overall the story itself is great and sure worth watching, even if only for the amazing scenarios. I can't wait for Gun Gale Online to air!",8

                I think SAO is the most unfair, overly criticized, over hated show in recent memory. I honestly loved this show. I thought it had an extremely interesting premise when I first started this show. A game that everyone in the world wanted to get and now everyone is trapped. And it is also interesting how they incorporated how people survive in hospitals while being trapped in the headset.
I found the story very capturing and I loved the development of the characters throughout the show. The romance, story, and action in this show I thought was top notch. I really began to root of the main
                  couple as they were very good together and their love grew through the show.",10
