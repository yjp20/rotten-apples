                -Minor plotting events will be addressed and forwarned in advance-
It's easy to point the finger at Boku No Hero Academia and label it as just one and the same as any other shounen that populates the medium. To make broad statements about the characters themselves being repackaged personalities with only a fresh coat of paint and appearance to their name. Or something to the effect of its story being recycled. And if you were to choose that stance, defendants would be hard-pressed to argue against it. But if you did decide to adopt that approach, that then calls into question the very essence of critiquing
                  a shounen in such restrictive terms, to begin with. 
If a shounen isn't allowed to be about the fundamental fight between good and evil, with said fights being carried out through the proxy of colorfully decorated personalities, then at what point does it cease to make sense for it to even be made at all? Or better yet, why bother to scrutinize it for doing what that genre has been predicated on since its inception? At what point does valid criticism capsize towards the side of pointless nitpicking? You won't always discredit comedies for having situational humor nor will you shame an action movie for delivering on its promise of cool fights and chase scenes. So why then is that benefit not allotted to shounens for being just that; a shounen? What I’m trying to say, in more words or less, is if a shounen isn't allowed to be a shounen without being reprimanded, what purpose does it even serve anymore?
With all that being said, couldn't a shounen that operates within the realm of its genre commonalities be allowed to revel in it, even if it may air on the side of self-indulgence at times? I say it should. Not every shounen could escape its role to become Fullmetal Alchemist nor should it be required to. In the same way, not every action film is expected to be a seminal game-changer in the way The Matrix did for bullet-time effects and stylized violence or Inception for its audiovisual craftsmanship and technical proficiency. Sometimes, being the byproduct to ride the wave of other tentpole entries is just fine. And in that regard, Boku No Hero Academia has proven to be a steady entry in the ever-expanding superhero/shounen canon, and I see no reason to ostracize it because it isn't overly ambitious. 
What can and will be critiqued, however, is the mechanics of its universe and the functionality of all the moving parts—characters and their purpose notwithstanding. No matter the demographic or genre it services, poor writing isn't autonomous to critique, and in my opinion, that’s the space where a reviewer is needed to occupy. The utilization of literary devices is something all storytelling media shares, and it’s in this truth that we can adequately gauge quality control in a fair manner. We don’t need critics to tell us that “SPOILER ALERT, shounens have very simple themes.” Anyone with a modicum of common sense could do that on their own. But what’s usually beyond the general knowledge of the viewing audience is the inner-workings that drive the content they consume. Basically, how well does the title in question use the tools at its disposal? And with that in mind, Boku no Hero Academia has some kinks it needs to iron out before it occupies any shelf-space alongside the genre’s cherished entries. Thankfully, this 2nd season shows promise of that possibly coming to fruition if they handle the content properly moving forward. 
But before we open that can of worms, let’s get everyone up to speed. 
Coming off season one's finale, our group of young heroes finds themselves becoming in-house celebrities on their school's campus, and for good reason. They fought against real-world villains, a situation that's already rare enough for students but made all the more alarming given that the face-off took place on school grounds. This places everyone on high alert as they move forward with the calendar year. And as new challenges emerge to face them, this period of their lives will serve as their first jumping-off point into finding out what it truly means to be a hero. 
This set of challenges first starts off with a genre staple, the tournament arc. And let's just be honest here, this 1st arc is only paying lip service to having a plot while the true intent is allowing physical alterations to happen, and that’s fine. Of course, the writers conjure up a reason to justify this event, and wisely, they made sure their pretext reflected in the show’s in-world rationalizing as well, taking the edge off for anyone that may have noticed it for what it was. Since being a superhero is its own profession in this world, many agencies choose this event to scout new talent, which also doubles up as a national sporting competition for regular civilians to enjoy. Which I must add is a far better excuse for this setup than what most people would give it credit for. And while this arc came with all the bells and whistles that make any shounen tournament fun, it was also the weakest part of the 2nd season for the reason that’s pivotal to making the whole thing work. 
The thing that plagues this portion of the show’s run was something I praised the 1st installment of getting right the first time around. And no, it has nothing to do with the self-evident cliché of the arc’s existence. As I mentioned earlier, a shounen doing “shounen shit” is not my concern here. You don’t need me telling you how overused tournament arcs are, that point will already be reiterated to death by every pseudo-critic that will see this as an opportunity to attack “low-hanging fruit.” Instead, what I plan to address is the functionality of the show’s premise in this arc. And to address that, what needs to be called into question is something that’s perhaps the easiest for everyday viewers to comprehend: proper buildup and payoff. 
The idea is simple, throughout the show, the creators will attempt to build up several things—whether it be story or character-centric—and then proceed to pay off their efforts through the natural metamorphosis of the narrative. That “payoff” can either be the central climax of the story or just the resolution of a subplot within it. 
To get a sense of this idea in action, let’s take a look at the following scenario: 
Let's say there's a superhero introduced who's explicitly stated to have the power to spawn water cannons from their arms. With the explanation of that character's ability made clear, it’s reasonable to expect that the buildup will probably revolve around the use of said power or the resolve of the character being tested at a crucial moment. Whether used against someone in specific or an event that calls for their particular ability, as long as that hero accomplishes or fails whatever the writers pit them against, it will serve as the payoff for their prominent introduction and highlighted power. 
This doesn't always mean that there needs to be a payoff right away, but if the story dedicates time away from its central focus to build up something or someone else, it's usually meant to foreshadow a future event later down the line where that knowledge the audience is given will be reincorporated. Pretty self-explanatory, right? Now, let's look at an example of that being done correctly in the 1st season of Boku no Hero, most notably with our protagonist Midoriya. He's shown as an astute kid that studies the anatomy and abilities of other heroes. This has become so synonymous with what defines him as a character that it’s even caught the attention of those around him. The buildup established has constantly been paid off with every physical altercation Midoriya finds himself in, as he’s continuously shown using his opponent’s strengths to his advantage, while also working with the limitations of his own power. 
The buildup: his excessive studying. 
The payoff: his tactical prowess on the battlefield. 
Now, this is where a problem rears its ugly head in this season. Throughout the entirety of the tournament arc, almost every buildup that doesn’t revolve around Midoriya or Todoroki, significant or otherwise, was poorly delivered upon, and in some cases, completely abandoned altogether. And no, this has nothing to do with antiquated terms like Chekhov's gun, but more so an inability to reconnect with things previously established. 
To help you spot this on your own, I will highlight a minor event in season 2 episode 3. Obviously, if you haven’t seen up to this point, there will be light spoilers ahead. Skip these two merged paragraphs if you want to avoid them. 
In episode 3 at around the 4-minute mark, characters Kirishima and Tetsutetsu are shown crushed under a gigantic robot, something that both characters ended up walking away from unscathed, thanks to their quirks. One could harden like a rock while the other hardens like steel, a quirk that makes them both the ultimate armor against things that would usually cause harm, or in some cases death, to any other student that found themselves in the same predicament. What’s important here is that the show took time to pause during the tournament arc to specifically highlight this, subconsciously signaling to the audience that it will come into play later on. 
Not even a full 7-minutes later into the same episode, at around the 11-minute mark, the show introduces an obstacle for the students to get through. This obstacle is a minefield covered with non-lethal explosive charges, a fact the announcer reinforces. It can harm the students but not to the point of endangering their lives. Now, this is very important to note, because like we already established 7-minutes prior, two students survived what would in any other case be life-threatening injuries to other students without a quirk specifically designed to counteract it. So it stands to reason, this obstacle would be perfect for two students who can quite literally become armor, right? Wrong, because as far as the show is concerned, the only characters that matter, at this point, is the three main ones. And even without zeroing in on those two characters in specific, everyone else, from the likes of Uraraka who’ve been shown to defy gravity to Hatsume who had gadgets made specifically for courses like this, are all left not using their advantages to overcome the obstacle. 
And this kind of logic occurs throughout the entire runtime of the tournament arc. Where the 1st season paid extra attention to its characters' quirks and how they can be utilized in combat, in this arc, these secondary characters are now just used as dick-measuring extras to place the main ones on a pedestal. What I just highlighted was only one of several times this occurred. 
With that kind of reasoning, it would be like if the water cannon superhero previously mentioned were to end up finding themselves in front of a burning building, but instead of using their Quirk to put out the fire, they just stood there looking at it instead. If framed in the mindset that Boku no Hero does with its supporting cast, they would do nothing as the building catches ablaze, not out of negligence but out of failed returns on initial investment towards the character's introduction and buildup. 
Thankfully, the 2nd half of this season balances the power mechanics again. Something that’s complemented further with the far more exciting scenario they’re placed in. 
What gives intrigue to the 2nd arc of Academia is how it chooses to challenge the notion of justice in a world overpopulated by Quirk users. If 80% of the world has Quirks, how can there be any stability in the superhero job sector? Well as it turns out, the answer to that question has already been pre-written into the show, but it’s only now that the idealism of the classroom environment has been traded out for the reality of the world they live in that we get to see the answer. Just because someone could run doesn’t automatically qualify them to be an Olympic athlete. In the same way, their Quirks, the one thing they thought made them unique, doesn’t matter all that much if its usefulness becomes pigeonholed to limited tasks. So beyond the students being challenged to use their skills in inventive ways in season one during all their physical exams, what the school environment was really prepping them for was adapting to a world that doesn’t always play to their strengths. And this kind of thing can lead to compromise, and sometimes that’s not for the best. 
This realization made by those with an advantage could breed vanity, while others that need to compromise may grow resentment towards those at the top. So in that sense, justice in a world full of superheroes like this one could just amount to a rat race to profit and self-benefit. The idea of standing for what’s right could become lost in a world where the bottom dollar might be all that matters for some. A diluted cesspool of what it means to be a “hero” has effectively worked its way into the mix. And in a system where the good guys can become no more distinguishable from a business person thinking with a capitalist mindset, radical ideas of reform can begin to emerge. Ideas that may be voiced by a fanatic but may still contain some semblance of truth behind it. Not all ""villains"" are birthed from wickedness, some might just be disenfranchised, which is an interesting commentary that could just as easily be applied to everyday life. This is something that seems to be interwoven into the subtext of this 2nd arc while all the hero shenanigans happen on the surface. And perhaps a glimpse of future storylines to come. Either way, what’s important is seeing all the students hone their skills while realizing there’s much more to becoming a hero than what presumptions they may have had prior. 
And yeah, a lot of this is based on conjecture, but going off the clues that the show keeps hinting towards, I wouldn't be surprised if the future installment of this series finds itself tackling the same sociopolitical dilemma that other superhero stories like Concrete Revolutio and Samurai Flamenco attempted to highlight. Either way, the future is looking bright for Academia if it manages to pull it off. 
Of course, I don’t have to tell you that the art and animation look greats; it’s Bones, good art, and animation is within their wheelhouse. If you liked the comic book apparel of the 1st season, this season just doubles down on that. I could go on and on about how much fun the fights were or how catchy the soundtrack is but honestly, you don’t need me to tell you that, the work speaks for itself. But what I do want to get across is that this season seems to show the efforts of its prior storylines finally starting to pay off. Where the 1st installment helped set up the world and characters that live in it, here, all that establishment is finally being used to craft something far more interesting than the sum of its parts. 
So no, I don’t think Academia is quite at that level to be celebrated just yet, but the groundwork has certainly been laid for future installments to come in and shake things up. But until that time comes, let’s just enjoy a shounen that’s comfortable in just being itself.",6,ZephSilver

                After watching the first season of Boku Hero no Academia (My Hero Academia), I can’t help but feel wanting for more of this series. The first season consisted of only 13 episodes. It adapted the general premise of the story and had its character roster in set. However, it missed the opportunity to expand more and build on those elements. Have no fear. Season 2 is here and it’s set to fill the gaps for you diehard fans of this classic shounen adventure.
One major part of the sequel is that the length is almost twice the duration of the first season. It consists of 25
                  episodes (including an anime original) as part of its storytelling. Therefore, expect almost twice as much as details. As an avid fan of the manga, I’m also rather impressed by the faithfulness of its adaptation standards. Expecting this show to hit a lot of its marks is no easy task and I had some doubts at first. Still, the sequel does a splendid job at crafting the essence of its story. At its core, the show is about heroes in a fictional world. Protagonist Izuku Midoriya (nicknamed Deku) tries to make a difference in his world by trying to become a hero. 
Something that I often found appealing about Boku Hero no Academia is how stylish it establishes itself. It’s a typical shounen series yet is able to spread its themes and knows how to do so. The second season asks a question: what really makes a hero? From the first half, we get a tournament (U.A. Sports Festival Arc) that pits the best of the best between classes. While this may seem like a generic battle tournament you can find in many shounen series, Boku Hero no Academia sets itself to establish characters within its tournament. Prominent characters such as Deku, Ochako, Bakugo, and Todoroki gives the audience their insight on their reasoning for fighting. While some of their principles can be disputed, they sent a clear message that becoming a hero is no easy path. At least for these characters, being a hero is more than just about saving others. The Sports Festival arc also examines the background story of Todoroki, a character that we knew little about from the previous season. It invites moments of sympathy as we see how tragic his past has influenced his character in the present.
Meanwhile, the show still maintains its presence of antagonists. Perhaps the most prominent of these is Hero Killer Stain, a new villain with his own objectives and morals. Again, his character ties with the question of “what makes a hero”. In his mind, there are certain rules that establishes what a “true hero” is from the “fake ones”. Season 2 has psychology that makes antagonists such as Stain feel meaningful as a character. It motivates other heroes to realize what they are and what to fight for. Don’t believe me? Just ask Tenya.
As I watched more and more of season 2, I can’t help but realize that the sequel serves as a way to prepare for the characters/heroes for what’s really ahead. What I mean is that while the second season is rich in content, it still leaves some gaps to fill. Mainly, prominent villains such as Tomura Shigaraki and his right-hand man Kurogiri play very minor roles despite establishing themselves as a dangerous threat from the first season. All Might also plays a lesser role in this season despite still being the main hero. Although his role is still important for Deku’s development, it feels that his character dynamics with the boy is less. As a show loaded with characters, don’t expect everyone to get the same development as the main cast. While most characters gets some time to shine, others are left with less memorable moments or comic relief. (yes, I’m looking at you, Mineta) Finally, season 2’s storytelling can occasionally feel stale at times with the academy setting and themes. Luckily, the comedy gives the fans its entertainment value that’s deceptively fun to watch.
Bones studio (known for their adaptation of other super power and hero theme shows) returns with their animation quality. I must admit, season 2 sets the bar for is stylish animation. Battle scenes from the Festival Arc particular stand out that is simply mesmerizing. The fight between Deku and Todoroki is especially noticeable that captures the stellar choreography as I’d expect from this studio. Camera angles feel smooth with vibrant colors and body movements. However, there are a few scenes that feel stagnant especially during the fight with Stain. Perhaps some of those can be fixed later in BD/DVDs but it’s nothing too distracting. Character designs in this sequel also remains memorable for characters ranging from the barbaric design of the Hero Killer, pro heroes, and our main cast. 
When listening to the soundtrack, I can’t help but feel that everything is on point. From character voice mannerisms to the battle OST, it succeeds far more than it fails. I can honestly say that the voice mannerism of the characters really brings out the personalities of the cast. Characters such as Stain, All Might, Bakugo, and Todoroki especially stand out this season whenever they speak with dynamism and purpose. The theme songs offers a classic hero-like tune that’s hard to miss.
If you’re going to watch this second season, just know that it will be a thoughtful experience beyond the colorful battles. Everything has a reason ranging from the story, themes, morals, and even character names. I can’t say this enough but season 2 really bought out what I had expected as an adaptation. It’s faithful on most parts and leaves me hunger for more each episode. That being said, season 2 is still far from resolving the end story. It actually feels more like building up for more as certain characters are foreshadowed and more threats looms in the horizon for the main characters. However, I came into this show with high expectations and left with awe. With season 3 announced, this sequel is nothing short of been a classic.",9,Stark700

                *Minimum Spoiler Plus Ultra Review*
If you did not watch BNHA S1 then go watch that ASAP. 
TL;DR: Hype Hype, Finally a Shounen Anime worth watching Plus Ultra Hype! BNHA S2 is basically Naruto and DBZ's illegitimate child, Hunter X Hunter's bastard child raised by the all mighty Bones STUDIO that has stayed true to the manga and doing the show justice it really deserves! Definitely Binge-Worthy!

""So many to kill, so little time. None of you are worthy. None of you are All Might"" - Stain
If there is one genre that can always hype people
                  up time after time, it's the classic shounen genre in anime. It's like scrambled eggs. The recipe is very simple yet the execution to get it consistently right day after day is difficult. Luckily, fans of one of the most acclaimed manga, BNHA, can rejoice that studio Bones have done yet another great job in beautifully adapting it their own way without deviating away from the manga to give the viewers total indulgence over a shounen anime people will remember for years to come. If you thought season 1 was good, well this season they just went PLUS ULTRA! 
The story is great. The anime being 25 episodes long is able to cover 3 different arcs from the manga. In season 1 we mostly focused on the character development of Deku. However, most of the supporting characters this season underwent major character development, especially characters like Todoroki, Iida and even Bakugo. That being said, the overaching development of Deku is ever present feeding off from the development of others. Really embodying the ""All for One"" motif as the show goes on. Aside from the characters, the art and animation is bold and vibrant. Nothing short from studio Bones standard. Even the OST and the OP & ED songs are just outright catchy and worth listening to over and over again. It's really hard to find flaw in such a good anime when even the two filler episodes are done so well that it catered to the fans long-time needs & curiosity! With that being said, let's dive deeper into the anime to really get a good grasp of what all the hype surrounding the anime is. Keep in mind, some spoilers might be revealed! 
*Minimum Spoilers Zone Begins*
""If you wanna stop this, then stand up! Because I've just got one thing to say to you! Never forget who you want to become!"" - Todoroki
There is no point revisiting the premise of the show. It hasn't changed since season 1. We know the end goal is Deku learning how to fully use All for One. The real plot is the whole journey to get there. This season had three different arcs. First we have the ever cliche shounen tournament arc; where all of the UA students battle it out from team battles to finally 1v1 battles. Surprisingly, the tournament arc actually ends with someone actually being declared a winner. No major interruptions or surprise villain gank happens. Now that's a surprise. This arc also features one of the fan favourite episode: Todoroki: The Origin. Next, we have the Stain arc, where Stain, a new villain or anti-villain, that has taken it upon himself to purge the world of fake heroes. It's a really dark arc and one of fan favourite arcs to be adapted. Lastly, we have the much rushed UA Final Hero Examination Arc, where UA students must fight against their teachers (Heroes) to pass their final exam. It also features the second fan favourite episode: Bakugo the Origin. In between these three arcs we are revealed more about the power of All for One and it's origins as well as League of Villains intentions and who is really pulling the puppet strings. Needless to say, Bones, with the help of Yoshihiko Umakoshi (Tournament Arc) and Takahiro Komori (Stain Arc + Exam Arc), did a great job adapting them in anime format. The only major issue was how different each directors take on how they adapted the arcs. Viewers will notice significant difference in battle sequences and camera angles from one director to the other.  
""Needless to say... I'll be a hero that even surpasses you (All Might)"" - Bakugo
Aside from the plot, the major highlight of this season is the character development. Besides Deku, other characters like Todoroki, Bakugo, Iida, Uraraka and even All Might goes through great lengths of character developments. Just as the two major side characters, Todoroki and Bakugo acts as great foils for Deku, actually all three personify the different attributes of All Might that establishes him as the best superhero of all time that not only saves lives but inspired the next generation to be the hero the nation deserves. Deku wants to save people with a smile. Todoroki wants to be his own person and not a prisoner of his blood. Bakugo wants to be the strongest and win with overwhelming force. This just goes to show you why Endeavor could never be the number one hero. It's never been about how many villains you beat or how strong you are. To be the number one hero means you have to be the beacon of hope and inspiration for all of Japan. The show's main running theme of quirk strength vs physical & mental strength is again revisited through this. The reason pros are good is because of their skills and judgment not because of their quirks. Besides the heroes, the most interesting character of the season has to be the villain or anti-villain, Stain. His motives are good because he wants to restore the title of Hero to something more respectable and pure. However, the method he uses to achieve this is similar to of a villain. Because of this, he starts a chain reaction of inspiring villains similar to how All Might inspiring heroes. All the parallels and juxtaposed characters in this series really adds to the depth and complexity of the show.      
*Minimum Spoiler Zone Ends*
""Meddling when you don't need to is the essence of being a hero"" - All Might
Beside the linear plot and dynamic characters, the technical aspects of this show really makes it stand out from other shounen animes. The animation quality from studio Bones is just Plus Ultra. The characters, the fight sequences, the background cinematography are all beautifully hand-drawn. The vibrant colour palette gives it a rich warm tone that resonates throughout the anime. If that wasn't enough, the background OST coupled with the epic OP/ED songs slowly grows on you the more you listen to it. Out of the two OP songs, I think Peace sign is still my favourite. Lastly, the seiyuus of this show does a phenomenal job. There isn't a single character who did not benefit from having a star-studded seiyuu cast in BNHA. Kudos to them. Everything as a whole, really sets the mood and the hype each episode brings to the table. 
Overall, BNHA S2 is probably one of the best shounen animes we've been blessed with in the last decade. The shounen anime recipe have been replicated numerous times however it hasn't been executed to this degree in quite a while. The last great shounen anime of this calibre was FMAB. Oddly enough, it was actually studio Bones who also adapted it. They know that staying true to the manga is the ultimate rewarding experience for both new viewers and manga viewers. Nevertheless, I personally really enjoyed this anime and I can see myself easily binging this show again with my friends. It's just that type of show. Also Season 3 has been confirmed. Anyways, I recommend this show to all shounen anime fans and new fans wanting to venture into the shounen anime genre. Check it out let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Plus Ultra!!!

33486,"
                This is a two-part review where I'll be weighing in the positives and negatives of this show. 
Starting with what I thought it did right:
Despite Boku no Hero Academia’s rather familiar and simplistic premise, its thematic consistency and high production value made it possible for this title to gain recognition and significant following among the anime community. Season 1 managed to deliver in an impressive note and thankfully, that didn’t waiver at all in its continuing season. Much like its predecessor, Boku no Hero Academia 2 looks and sounds just as good—if not, even better. While it still didn’t take any risks, it did capitalize
                  on the tried and tested formula in battle shounen that never failed to appeal to this genre’s fans and took the liberty to put its own creative spin to it—which I daresay has been pretty successful: Solidly executed action-packed superhero show with a competitive school life and comedy on the side. The tone shifts felt natural and it didn’t fall into the trap of forcefully incorporating dark, tragic themes nor did it get too hung up on its more serious tone just to make it look deep or mature. This anime is fortunately devoid of any of that pretentiousness and instead, it embraced its simplicity, which resulted to a cohesive storytelling. It’s a show that knows what it wants to do and doesn’t go beyond its limitations. At least, not yet anyway.
Although Boku no Hero Academia also happens to lump in almost every character archetype in shounen, it was at least able to turn them into a colorful bunch with just the right amount of exposure. More importantly, there has been better characterization amongst its main cast, which I guess is to be expected since this season delved further into the actual plot where it opened more room for character growth. Our protagonist grew from a cry-heavy (it's not really a word, I know) underdog to an impressive hero in-training who now has more control over his power. His progress felt smooth and his worth as All Might’s successor was constantly tested and proven in all of the arcs covered. Todoroki also had a more significant role, wherein we also learned about his backstory, motivations, and we saw the shift in his dynamics. As did Ida, who was a key player in the second arc that involved the Hero-Killer, Stain. All Might is just as majestic and his power display against Deku and Bakugo in the exam arc was nothing short of spectacular. Their fight was awesome and arguably the best in this season.
Bakugo is still a mixed bag to be honest. He was still quite obnoxious with few redeemable moments, who also couldn’t seem rid himself off of the insecurity and hostility that he had always felt towards Deku. But on another note, he was absolutely hilarious and entertaining this season and I find it hard not to enjoy his chemistry with other characters, especially when he becomes the object of their mockery. His rage reactions are comedy gold and I wouldn’t be surprised if people actually consider him a walking meme at this point. There were also subtle hints of his development thrown here and there to keep us at the edge of our seats whenever he's on screen. The rest of the supporting cast, most especially the class A students, also had their fair share of the spotlight. Though some may complain about how little exposure the rest of the class A students had in the sports festival, I'd argue that it worked out for the story given that the focus of the arc were meant to be Deku and Todoroki in the first place.
I also want to commend how superb the sound, visuals, and animation were in this anime. This was mostly displayed in the Sports Festival arc, which in my opinion, is also this season’s highlight. Hats off to the voice actors as well, who did a phenomenal job conveying the characters' emotions in the most intense moments. They truly didn’t hold back in making this season a spectacle, contributing further to the anime’s general appeal. 
My issues with this show:
First that comes to mind is the underwhelming antagonists, given that there seems to be a tad few legitimate threats whose characters also managed to be interesting – Stain (granted that we haven’t seen the last of him) and a couple of new villains introduced by the tail end of the season might draw some intrigue back. In contrast to them, Tomura Shigaraki and his other minions in the League of Villains, ever since their introduction up to the most part of this season, are honestly just really—for the lack of better word—bleh.  Second, it’s still lacking in world-building. I was hoping to see even just a glimpse of how the rest of the world fairs in this storyline, but I guess it’s too early for that. Note that those I mentioned above are just very minor issues that I have with this season, hence, I'm not going to elaborate on it further. I’m aware that this is one of those overarching series that would take a little more time to explore its full potential; and that is fine, so I'll just leave it at that and that I’m not docking off points because of that. I will still keep these in mind as I tread further into the series, however.
Having all that said, my actual gripe with it is that it feels too comfortable. While Boku no Hero Academia is certainly one of the better battle shounen anime out there today, its generic or rather ordinary nature is also why I can’t consider it to be great. Besides its very impressive technical presentation and solid delivery, the story simply lacks the ingenuity or in other words, the “wow” factor that makes anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Hunter x Hunter, in my honest opinion, the pinnacle of the genre. Don’t misunderstand though—I don’t intend to draw comparisons just to glorify those aforementioned titles nor to put BnHA down. I’m also not necessarily implying that it’s automatically mediocre just because it doesn't have complex themes or isn’t unique. I simply want to make a distinction that justifies my score for this given that I also use the rating scale differently. While I believe that storytelling and execution are what separates the good shows from the bad, I also believe that a compelling narrative with equally compelling characters are what separates good shows from the elite. BnHA is simply lacking in that department.
As mentioned beforehand and despite its stylish, cartoon-esque style and my initial praise for its well-delivered plot and colorful characters, it doesn’t have any trait that makes it truly stand out and incomparable to others. As such became more apparent this season as we continue to witness yet again some very familiar and overdone concepts in shounen: the underdog protagonist who continues to work hard and also tries to seek acknowledgment from the rival who hates his guts; the good ol’ tournament that actually serves as a stage for the protagonist to inspire and subsequently “soften” another rival who has parental issues; a chance encounter with the murderous villain with misunderstood intentions to help a friend who was in a quest for revenge; the mysterious big bad lurking in the shadows; etc. That's not a fault in itself considering that it's normal to have shared themes or tropes in this genre. It does what shounen anime do after all. That said, such idea unfortunately doesn't save it from being predictable, run-of-the mill story wherein we can only look forward to how the creators will put their own spin to these tropes. And since it took inspiration from other well-known titles, it also suffers from the inevitable comparison due to it having very similar concepts that have already been done and outdone (arguably) by some of its predecessors.
It is still a good show for those who appreciate simple, solid, and well-animated shows though. I generally like action anime, so I was consistently invested. But for those who are not a fan of this genre or have seen almost everything it has to offer, it takes more than what BnHA presented to keep them genuinely impressed—which I really couldn’t blame them for. 
To wrap it up:
I still think that Boku no Hero Academia 2 is a fun-filled, easy to watch show with so much potential and it seems to tread in the right direction.  Whatever it may lack in story, setting, or characters, it still kind of makes it up with its consistency and entertainment value. Not to mention, its excellent animation and sound. It’s an eye candy that’s still worth the watch.

While Season 1 lacks of characterization with its characters, Season 2 finally putting some major character developments for the supporting characters while its Main Character also having a good development and don't get left behind at all.
For once, Yuuki Hayashi's soundtrack is a massive one in episode 10, bringing that scene into one of the most intense, well directed scene this season and not 100% sure but that last scene's animation really feels like Yutaka Nakamura's work ( Black & White frame by frame animation + Yutapon Cubes Destruction ) AND PROVING THAT BONES IS THE BEST SHOUNEN STUDIO ON THE ANIME INDUSTRY.

                Yo, I've pretty much exhausted my patience with the overly generous reviews for this show, so I'm going to resist the masses and give this show a real review. 
This show is super basic. I don't have a problem with shows being basic, so long as they are good. Unfortunately, this show really isn't that good. Being basic AND not that good is a pretty deadly combo. The only thing positive I can really say about this show is that it's very professionally made and well polished. 
As far as I can tell this show is attempting to be the new shonen super power of
                  animes. I'm therefore going to review it as such. 
The big shonen anime generally have a slow and steady kinda plot. Bleach, Naruto, One Piece etc are pretty good examples of this. Often they follow an ""arc"" based format. The cast of characters remains mostly the same as they progress through these arcs and the characters and sometimes the overarching plot develops along the way. Boku no Hero Academia pacing seems to be set up in order to facilitate turning this into a very long anime. It very well may be setting up future plot points but as I watch it feels as if the shows going nowhere at all. It's almost as if the plot is getting side tracked. This is something that tends to happen in these types of anime but generally, these moments serve to develop the character or their powers/abilities. I can't see any noticeable signs of that in this show though and it simply feels like they are wasting time that could be spent on more relevant things.
I'm gonna keep the art/sound reviews short. This is a pretty big budget anime. As a result, the quality of the animation and sound is high quality. That Being said it's basic. There also doesn't seem to be any kind stylistic elements to the show. Twinstar Exorcists was a very similar show to this one, IMO, that at least had a very well-crafted style in its art and sound. Boku has a generic design for characters and settings while at the same time making them less interesting than other animes with a generic design. Hunter x Hunter had a pretty basic style, but the characters in that show had infinitely better design, not only in the way they were drawn but also in their personalities, ideology, motivations and even the little detail like the way they moved and carried themselves. 
I kind of already started talking about the characters in the art/sound category. In the same way that the art and ""style"" of this show is lacking the characters are as well. They are all characters we've seen before but what's sad is that they simply aren't better than those other characters. I have no problem with an ""I want to be a hero of justice"" character but I do have a problem with one that is to entirely uninteresting. His entire motivation comes from when he saw a superhero as a kid and thought he looked cool. I'm nearly certain every person in this fictional universe had that same experience at some point. He's certainly determined but possessing determination is not enough to create a character with depth. Early on he had the potential interesting quirk of being quick-less and still aspiring to be a superhero. Instead of having him struggle with that fact as he fights to achieve his goal he is instead given an OP quirk and the only notable thing about his character is erased.
The main saving grace of this show is that despite its mediocrity, it manages to be fairly entertaining. Honestly, I think everyone's just been in the mood for a new high budget shonen super series to dive into. There is some fairly decent action as well as a bit of that classic shounen combination of hype and feels. It keeps you just barely entertained enough to come back next week for another episode.
Yes, this review was harsh, but someone needs to balance out this shows mad hype train. This show really isn't anything special and it's certainly not a masterpiece. The shonen mega series of the past easily beat it. If this site had been this popular during the golden days of bleach and naruto then those two shows would no doubt have a much higher rating. Would those reviews be accurate? Hell no. Wait for your hype to die down, watch the show objectively, compare it to other things you've seen and you will no doubt realize that this show does not deserve the level of praise it receives.",5,INeedAnAlias

Anime is almost done but hey 1 ep could change my whole outlook on this shitepaste(no it couldn't)
TL;DR
Don't
Alrighty after quite some time I watched through all these episode of season 2 and can confirm that this anime is letting me down more than a quadriplegic Parkinsons patient.
Art and sound.
They didn't improve much from the original and even there they were nothing worth noting. I do not wish to stick on this for long until some adrenaline pumping action scenes come up. Opening is a bit of a doozy, the first one was definitely better at setting the mood for this type of anime but alas
                  all good things must come to an end which is something I won't be saying when this anime comes to a close.

Story.
People have superhero powers, there's a school for shit like that, our protag gets into the best superhero school.
Alrighty now let's plunge deeper into the rectal cavity of this story. Initially we are met with probably best thing to have in your anime, a tournament arc. Unfortunately as it continues the quality of it keeps dropping until the point where it feels like creators just want to get it out of the way as soon as possible. Fights get wrapped up in moments and those that stretch for longer are extremely dull with fighters using the same move over and over again until one of them says ,, sod it,, and blows up half the arena. I will concur that next arc is good. It regards this hero killer dude called Stain and,despite being finished in just a few episodes, shows one of the most hectic and dynamic fights in the anime. As a conclusion we have yet,deep sigh, another training. Which is understandable cause it'd be quite weird if an anime about a hero school had very little school in it. However this conclusive arc is hit and miss in it's execution. Long story short it comes down to students fighting teachers. Students are in pairs but teachers are single with their limbs being weighed down with some classic weight bands or whatever. I have to say some of the fights are quite fun to watch keyword being SOME. Others as is already fashion with this anime are dull with whole thing being decided after a constant back and forth between two parties.
Here's a 6 because this anime keeps leaving me with dry feeling in both my mouth and heart as there's not even some moments like in season 1 where you could actually feel a semblance of emotion in shriveled black amalgamations we call hearts.
Characters.
Now this is something that actually changed . More focus has been set on characters that didn't get time to shine in the first season, this phenomenon becoming weaker as season flutters onward. As for our main character, the underdog crybitch of our story, he actually achieves some decent control over his power instead of having it break his own body whenever it's used.
Let me put another sentence in for MC. He is a whiny bitch and seems to spent most of his fights crying and yelling how he's going to give it his best and all that tripe.Not that he has to care much about harming himself when his plot armor can take a nuclear strike with no issue. Well to be fair I'm being a bit hyperbolic there but bollocks are there some moments where he keeps gushing the same crap we've heard dozens of shounens do and then have somebody or something pushing his arse out of a pinch.
Some characters got their motivations laid out ,which is always nice despite it being done in a really scrappy manner,and we are treated to a batch of new characters, that get all meaning and screen time kicked out of them by the second half of the arc.
Screw you here's a 5 there's about one good character to be made out of all the shallow, loud annoyances that are considered characters but could only pass as such in a deviantArt fanfic.
Enjoyment.
This part had me hooked but fucked it up so hard with it's goddamn annoying characters from whom some can have their whole dialogue written down on a one ply toilet paper.
Sure there's a few good moments and fights but if I wanted to scrape something positive out of a demented mess I'd work as a life coach.
What infuriates me is that this show somehow fucks up after every positive act it presents. I can't say that it's worse than part one, at least not in all departments, but I'll be fucked by the last of rhinoceros before giving this a higher rating for what it has put out. All my enthusiasm for this anime died after the Hero Killer arc and it's quite sad that a back alley mid tier hero killing enthusiast with a dumb ideology that makes no sense in light of what we've been shown is somehow a highlight of your show.
Here's a 6 and a trophy full of spunk for successful fuck up on every corner.",6,ipoopcandy
33486,"
                Whenever I watch this show I begin to get flash backs of SAO.
That should sum up exactly how I feel about this anime. 
The show has a great concept and interesting characters, but unfortunately they are for the most part are sorely underdeveloped and have very little depth to them (as this season has progressed this is slowly began to change with a few characters).  The fight scenes are well animated and are a breath of fresh air into to dullness that is created through the tropes and rehearsed plot points that you could find in dozen of other animes. 
The thing that truly
                  keeps this anime from going to mediocre to okay is the dreadful main. The MC carries out the rehashed ""severely under powered high school boy with irrational hero complex somehow gains the power to take down super powered villains and classmates despite only having a few weeks training"".  Add on the super inspirational speeches on why he will never give up despite getting the shit kicked out of countless times and bang, that's all you need to know about the MC because he hasn't changed since the first season. 
Ultimately this anime misses the mark on a lot of things. Exploring old plot points and character tropes is always a bad thing if they are carried out right, but ultimately this misses the mark on a lot of things.",3,CrispiestBacon

Spoilers ahead:
Protecting people in the face of adversity; even in the means of sacrificing yourself, using unique strength only found in the hearts of some people for good, being brave and standing up for the people you love… this is what it means to be a hero. A hero isn’t something you strive to be, nor is it something to be viewed as a career. To be qualified as a hero in the first place, is to be selfless. By devoting all your life trying
                  to become a hero by wearing a cape and a superhero outfit made by plastic is, in and of itself, a selfish and childish dream. By dreaming so only results in a messiah complex. 
To be running around and jumping from building to building wearing goofy clothes only defeats the purpose of being a hero. Only people who are looking for attention do this; narcissism at its best. 
Having a girl wear a suit that reveals most of her cleavage, and a skirt so short to the point where it should be called a belt, only makes me wonder why she didn’t become a prostitutional entertainer instead. And also having a character wearing a cape whilst stepping on the bad guy they just beat up whilst laughing like a maniac and shouting, “Don’t worry, your savior’s here.” only makes me wonder why he didn’t become an exhibitionist. 
Every character in My Hero Academia only have a single goal in mind: to become a hero that everyone looks up to. That’s really it. There’s no other character in the series that has a different ambition — even if they do have a bit of a different ambition, it’s still completely connected to being an admirable hero. Being a show about heroes, it’s okay for everyone wishing to become a hero. But if that’s the only primary goal in their mind, then that’s just a writing excuse — all of these characters have a goal, thus, all of these characters are three-dimensional — or so the author thinks. The characters are like a group of Flamingos who have chain reactions. If you can’t handle writing a very large cast of characters — especially by trying to flesh out all of them — then don’t try to do it in the first place. 
Characters are indeed hard to write. It’s definitely okay to have a large cast of characters, but do so at your own risk. The writer, in this case, tried to give some personality to other side characters. But what resulted in was underdevelopment of main characters — not to mention failing at even making the side characters decent. 
Deku is the underdog of the world. He’s also shy and not so good socializing with girls; in other word, he is us. This isn’t supposed to be an ecchi-harem show, Kohei Horikoshi. 
Trying to make us experience everything through Deku’s body only admits that he’s flat as a character. Normally, we’re supposed to put ourselves in the protagonist’s shoes, but to actually become the protagonist is lazy writing. This is just an excuse trying to make the character “relatable”. A character can still be flat even if they have an ambition, backstory, and development. Because execution is what matters. 
Deku’s ambition and backstory are quite simple. He wants to be a hero like All Might, but he doesn’t have a quirk, unlike most people. He then gains powers from All Might by eating a single piece of his hair. This is all fine and all, but what about his development? He pretty much stays the same and has the same mentality throughout the whole two seasons. Being stronger and being able to control your powers better isn’t character development. What Kohei Horikoshi tries to do is make Deku break his bones over and over again just for the sake of looking “cool”. And then he breaks more bones in the second season, which tricks you into thinking that he developed as a character. But he has the same ideology and personality intact; only being able to control his powers, or rather All Might’s powers better. 
I doubt the possibility that Deku will ever improve as a character throughout the whole show; he’ll stay the same; crying, speaking, thinking, and acting the same exact way he did at the start. The reason is simple: there is no room for improvement. Deku is, at first, actually what he should have developed into, not start with it. Only if he develops into an evil character — developing an ideology about heroes the opposite of the one he had before — can he be able to improve, or develop as a character. But the spoiler which Deku gave us at the beginning, and also looking at the genre of this show, there’s zero percent possibility. Having better powers, or controlling a power better, or creating your own proper power is often confused with character development. But it’s not.
Deku is known as a rare protagonist because he’s smart and analytical. But he’s stereotypically so. Putting your hand on your chin and thinking aloud while having words flying out of your head isn’t identified as being smart; it’s just an attempt at being one. It’s very easy to make other characters point at him calling him “smart”, when in reality, he’s only slightly above average. He actually reminds me of Sakamoto from Sakamoto desu ga — due to the fact that every character looks up to him, for the exception of some characters who hate him and want to surpass him, but end up giving up and acknowledging the main character’s superiority. But let’s not forget that Sakamoto was loved due to him being cool, meanwhile, Deku is liked for no justified reason whatsoever. Sure, he is strong. But don’t forget that he was a loser who was being bullied at first and viewed negatively by almost everyone. So there’s no way people’s view on him would change in such a short span of time just because he got stronger. 
What about the girl he saved once which automatically made them very close friends — Uraraka? She’s very poorly written. She reminds me of Tenten from Naruto when she kissed Neji’s ass in the Chunin exam. Her main purpose is to be cute and support the main character. She shouldn’t be one of the main characters of the show, especially considering how weak her character arc was. Her backstory is basically having bad family circumstances, so she wants to become a “hero” for financial gain. She has about two or three personality traits. And that’s it. I can’t help but think that this show would’ve been fine without having her even appear in the show. There’s nothing to add on to her character because I feel like she’s even more underdeveloped than other side characters. 
Avenger stories are, at best, fine. Iida’s whole drama about avenging his brother was executed poorly, and was extended way longer than it should have. The best way to realize if a character is three-dimensional and has depth, is to have the character pursue a certain motivation, but doesn’t see the need in explaining his or her actions to other people. Iida’s long monologue explained all of his motivations to Stain; his enemy. This is the best example of how you should be showing instead of telling. If a story tries to flesh out their characters by having them tell their ideology, instead of showing their ideology through their actions just shows the lack of the author’s writing ability to do so. Iida’s motivation is in and of itself fine, just done very poorly. 
Another example of a fine character with a fine backstory, yet terrible execution — Todoroki’s whole character development is eventually decided by mister psychiatrist, Deku. Todoroki is a decent character, but was very inconsistent throughout the whole show. His personality changed through dialogue — meaning that he’s Todoroki in one scene, but a totally different person in another. His ideology, personality and perspective change in a very short amount of time, making him inconsistent. He started as a very promising character, but is slowly evolving into another one of Boku no Hero’s ordinary characters. 
If you can remove a particular character from a story and can still have the story function as well as it did before means that the character should either not be there entirely, or write them differently so that he/she has a purpose in the story. If the author of Boku no Hero did this, then he would be left with a total of four-five characters that can actually function as an independent character. For a show praised by the way it handles its characters very well, it’s actually very subpar when it comes to characters. 
The author wrote a character for the sole reason of being hated — Minoru Mineta, the pervert. Why? Was this used so that we hate a character so much that other characters feel like decent people compared to him? There is no doubt that the author wrote this character this way intentionally. Was he expecting people to like him? I doubt it, hence why I think my reasoning is correct. If the author himself doesn’t care about his own characters then why should we?
The characters in Boku no Hero remind me of IDubbbz; dressing in a very weird costume, and dancing around here and there, shouting, “I wannabe gay!” — If this analogy isn’t true, then I don’t know what is. 
If the writer is eagerly trying to make me like the characters by using very cheap techniques, then I might as well admit the absurd fact that my, and also many other people’s emotions are being toyed by. I don’t see any positivity from this show — if the character’s are merely “simple”, then why use tricks such as melodramatic character arcs to further our bond with the characters? Doesn’t this contradict the simplicity of the characters?
The characters’ existence is for a sole reason: comedy. Whenever a comedic scene comes by — which is very frequent — I’m reminded of Black Clover because of the amount of screeching thrown at the screen. Characters are eventually used as a remark-factory in this case, as in remarks are the only things side characters ever say. Not only does this make for very cheesy comedy, but it also confuses my emotions. This show is ultimately a comedy, so when a serious and “emotional” moment comes up, I laugh, wondering why the characters are all of a sudden taking everything seriously. I’ve laughed more at sad and emotional scenes than I did in the actual comedy scenes. 
When Deku finds out that he doesn’t have a quirk and goes home and plays the video about All Might on his computer, I was smiling, because that’s what this show wants me to do, right? I mean, look at Deku’s crying face. He’s crying with a hysterical smile. I automatically take this as the show trying to tell me not to take this seriously. If the show wanted me to take it seriously, then why have him smile instead of frown? I know a lot of people try to hide their actual emotions by smiling, but kids are straightforward with their emotions. 
Uraraka’s character arc wasn’t supposed to be emotional at all, yet they somehow tried to make it emotional. Same with Momo losing her confidence. As I came upon this particular episode, I tried to watch the previous episode thinking that there was something I missed. But there was nothing. I was very confused as to why she’s even acting like that. It was apparently because she lost her battle in the tournament, but they went way over the top with her drama. The show can’t draw a clear line between comedy and drama. E.g. Showing a character’s breasts in the middle of a “horrifying” battle, Mineta gripping another character’s breasts while another character is on the verge of death, etc… And so when I come upon these overdramatic scenes, I no longer care what happens to the characters, since you can’t take something seriously when it doesn’t even care to take itself seriously to begin with. 
People like to point fingers at other shows like Anohana and Kiznaiver and call them overdramatic. Yet Boku no Hero has as much, if not twice as much overdramatic events — a shounen having more drama than some other slice of life-drama show is very weird. What part of Boku no Hero is overdramatic, exactly? All of it, probably. As I said before, this anime is a comedy; a pure one in that matter. So when the show throws in these overdramatic emotional moments, I laugh off — not considering the possibility that the characters are on the verge of dying. 
Since we’re talking about death, let’s talk about plot armour. I’ve heard many times from many people comparing Boku no Hero with Naruto, calling it superior. Even though Naruto had immense amount of plot armour with its main characters, Boku no Hero goes beyond the limit as to give every single character in the series plot armour. Plot armour is okay as long as it has the right amount of it.
Naruto is tragic, and had a lot of characters die. Meanwhile, Boku no Hero is a very carefree and a childish series. The kids were beating up the villians in ease. It’s like they’re so experienced in their first try. None of them even had any major injuries. If Naruto was Boku no Hero Academia, then Naruto would’ve become Hokage in episode four. 
I would’ve fallen in love with Boku no Hero Academia had I been an eight year old, because that’s what children want: a fun series about heroes saving the day, which has no development or tragedy; something you watch on Saturday mornings. 
I’ve got nothing against simplistic shows. In fact, I love a lot of shows which are very simplistic, and in some cases, generic. But that’s not how I view Boku no Hero; rather than finding it simplistic, I thought of it as bland and subpar. 
Boku no Hero Academia isn’t generic. It’s actually subpar. This show is praised for having simple characters. But that’s my down point, because they aren’t even simple; they are so much simpler than simple. They are flat cardboard characters that are very hard to connect to. To begin with, one of the most important point of a story is to connect with the characters. Sure, there are shows and stories I’ve enjoyed and loved without liking the characters, but the possibility of that happening could be because of the superb storytelling. Does Boku no Hero Academia have that? No. The story is, at best, average. The world building is underexplored (Using my knowledge upon completing the first two seasons). 
At the very least, I remember the names of about four or five characters from the series. As for other characters, I don’t even remember them in general, let alone their names. As I said before, the characters are dealt with simultaneously; like a chain reaction. Making all of them have the same personality traits and reactions to particular events. They speak, eat, fight, and react in the exact same way. E.g. when everyone in the class talks simultaneously. 
The characters don’t each stand on their own because they aren’t even a fully fleshed out character to begin with. Characters are indeed the weakest part of the series — but the ideology is not only poor, but horrible. 
Back to heroism, I don’t like the way heroes are viewed and treated in Boku no Hero Academia. Some of the most memorable heroes of anime aren’t characters that wear capes and acknowledge their heroicness, they’re rather the complete opposite. Okabe from Steins;Gate is, in my opinion, the most memorable hero of all anime. He went through more than a thousand wordlines, experiencing so much adversity, pain, and death just to save his friends. This is what it truly means to be a hero. (Not shounen, but still profits my point) Never did Okabe say, “This is a story of how I became the greatest hero of all time.” Admitting your own heroicness, no matter how good of a hero you are, defeats your title as a hero. 
I can also say the name of a lot of characters from other series that can absurdly be considered better heroes than the characters of Boku no Hero ever were. 
Put any hero in Boku no Hero in a situation where they have to choose between two options — those options being: Would you rather save humanity from a disaster that could potentially kill billions of people, but be considered evil by everyone, or save a single person, but be considered the greatest hero of all time; being admired all over the world, forever — most, if not all characters would definitely choose the second option. Basically, it’s Boku no Pride Academia, not Boku no Hero. 
Now ideology aside, the underlying issue of this series is that, I don’t see this anime going anywhere. I don’t see any meaning for its existence. At the beginning, Deku says, “This is a story of how I became the greatest hero.” I, and many other people, know that the main character is going to be the best; prevailing over any other character in the series. But we still have a feeling of uncertainty at times. Deku confessing the future on screen, in the very beginning frame of the first episode, just removes the whole point of this show. At the very least, I wanted to experience the journey that Deku went through without knowing what’s to come in the future. There’s no point in watching this series anymore because I’ve basically watched the whole show now. And the problems of Deku’s character, as I talked about before, removes the potential of me caring for his journey.
I despise this show in all of its being. There’s a barricade wall between me and the characters; distancing us from each other and preventing any further connection other than merely knowing two bland personality traits of each character. Additionally, the thought of having my emotions toyed with by cheap tricks makes me feel disgust, combined with the fact that the second season was two-cour even though there wasn’t any strong necessity; not to mention how the dullness of the show made it feel like a sixty-four episode series. 
The only thing preventing me from rating it a one out of ten is the superb visuals by Studio Bones. I respect this show as a piece of art, but no more fabric of the show do I admire. 
I’m open to any criticism I’d get upon closing this review off saying this is one of my least favorite show of all time.",2,77AnonyMei__77

                Boku no Hero Academia is often said to be the new Naruto or One Piece - the next smash-hit action series. Season 1 laid the groundwork for that, but at a mere 13 episodes, it couldn't truly demonstrate why Hero Academia deserves to be considered THE new great action series. But with season 2 comes a solid 25-episode run, giving it the chance to spread its wings and prove that not only is it a great successor to the old genre greats, but in many respects improves on them.
A big part of why this works better than the first season is that where the first
                  season could be slow at times, season 2 is perfectly-paced. It moves at breakneck speed with barely a wasted moment, even despite the presence of a single (surprisingly good) filler episode. This makes Hero Academia an excellent binge-watching experience.
Season 2 covers three key arcs from the manga, the first of which is a tournament arc (in true battle shonen spirit) based around a school sports festival. Throughout this arc, the fight choreography is utterly exceptional. Bones have always been a studio known for their impressive production, but even by their standards the animation is jaw-droppingly good, made all the better by mangaka Horikoshi Kouhei's unique sense of style. Even the directing is a notch above their standard, averting the usual use of lazy panel-to-panel adaptation that is excessively common in this genre in favour of more elaborate compositions that can only be achieved because of the change of medium.
But though the Sports Festival arc excels for its action, that's not the reason this arc stands out. Instead, it's because at its core is a strong character arc for Shoto Todoroki. The arc ultimately becomes less about who will win the tournament as whether Todoroki will overcome his inner demons. While there's nothing wrong with a standard tournament arc, this turns it into something greater, using our investment in not only Todoroki but in Izuku to create some of the series greatest emotional highs and compelling moments.
This represents one of the greatest tools that HeroAca has at its disposal - an ensemble cast of lovable characters. The characters we were briefly introduced to in season one are all given greater detail here, with their motivations, personalities, and friendships with one another all built upon (especially in the third and final arc of this season). With only these few simple details, the writing builds the characters laconically, giving even minor characters strong personalities while allowing the core cast the screentime for full character arcs.
Another such character arc comes in the story immediately following the tournament, revolving around Tenya Iida. After a traumatic event, his sense of morality is shaken, resulting in a story arc that sees him come to understand the meaning of him being a hero.
This is all brought about by the biggest masterstroke that Hero Academia has had so far - Hero Killer Stain, this arc's primary antagonist. Where the previous villains of Hero Academia are more outright evil, Hero Killer Stain acts in rebellion against society, against the nature of heroics in the universe of HeroAca, where people become heroes out of greed and pride rather than for truly noble reasons. 
His presence in the story is brief, but the ramifications of it are huge. Stain's moral code turns the focus of the series onto the morality of heroics - what makes someone a true hero. Alongside some of the darker elements of hero society introduced into this series, this fleshes out the setting, sowing seeds of discontent with the world as it is and bringing an element of social commentary into the fray. The conflict from here on out isn't just one of heroes vs. villains, it's a conflict of change vs. the status quo.
But the most interesting change to the conflict in HeroAca isn't the external battle, it's the internal one. The question of what makes someone a true hero turns the development of the main cast - especially Izuku Midoriya - into more than just one of becoming stronger physically. It becomes a story about growing as people. With every step that Deku grows in power, he grows as a person, becoming one step closer to being a true hero.
It's the slow growth of Deku's character that forms the emotional core of the series, and the newfound focus on moral codes helps us become even more invested in him and the rest of the cast. This turns Hero Academia into something more than the standard shonen fare whilst keeping everything that made those series compelling to begin with.
With this, Hero Academia has become one of the greats of its genre.

                This review covers both seasons and will contain some vague spoilers.
For a show called Boku no HERO Academia there's definitely a lot of academia but not much heroism. Makes sense too since according to this show, the word 'Hero' doesn't have an actual definition.. Yeah, apparently being a hero is whatever you want it to be. this is something a character in the show actually says at some point and we're supposed to see it as some kind of profound gospel.
I'll start by saying that I think the first 2 episodes of season 1 was the show at its best. Deku's backstory had a good
                  emotional punch to it and we get a glimpse of real heroism on the part of his childhood hero, All Might, via YouTube video. and in episode 2 Deku himself demonstrated real heroism by risking his life to rescue a kid who bullied him despite not having a super power. But before you know it, the show becomes no different from any other shonen that DON'T boast the word ""Hero"" in their title.. only with more training and a lot less fighting villains. It just becomes an endless barrage of competitiveness and egoism with actual heroic acts being an afterthought at best.
Everybody in this show just seems obsessed with the superficial aspects of being a hero, like the strength, the glory, the cool costume, the super hero nickname. Speaking of which, why do they even need a costume and nickname? Isn't that for keeping your identity hidden? We have half an episode dedicated to them picking out costumes and nicknames.. Which comes straight after a tournament that was broadcasted on prime time television and everyone in the street cheers for them while knowing their names and faces.. That's just one example of how this show comes off as gimmicky and disgustingly shallow, despite sometimes pretending that it has actual heart and a heroic spirit, none of it is convincing because the majority of content in the series doesn't compliment that at all.
Meh. This world is boring and unimaginative anyways. By reading the synopsis you'd know that 80% percent of the population now have super powers and yet the world is pretty much the same as ours, except they have super powered people working alongside the police and receiving tax payer money.. Which begs the question why the police is still needed or why the police aren't made up of super powered people but oh well. It's not like this setup is displayed well anyway.. When villains attack civilians in the street, all said civilians do is run away instead of using their powers to defend themselves, which most of them supposedly have...
But whatever, I don't really care about these nitpicks. The thing that bothers me more though is that most shonen consist of some cool fantasy setting where there's a lot to explore and potential adventure is at every turn.. while in this series the only thing to look forward to is seeing more people with different powers.. How exciting. And I don't think it's good as an American-stlye super hero show with a contemporary setting either (See the first three paragraphs)... 
Out of 38 episodes so far there's probably only about 9 that AREN'T training sessions or a tournament and there's only so much of that I can take when the fights aren't that great and there's barely any dramatic weight behind most of them. Furthermore there isn't really much of a connection between the training and the non training parts either. Near the end of season 1, Villains invade the school and basically hijack what was supposed to be another training session in order to kill the mentor character, All Might. And the Hero Killer arc (which only lasted about 3 episodes in season 2) had no relation to anything happening in the tournament that preceded it and just generally felt like a detour before we go back to more training again straight afterwards (though admittedly a pretty badass detour). There's definitely something building in the background but it's hard to see this as much of a story in the traditional sense, so far. 
Plus, I found the tournament to be fairly underwhelming as a whole. The less important fights ended very quickly and had unremarkable choreography (consisting of up to 5 unimportant fights per episode) and the more important ones that take up about half an episode or one whole episode and the fights in general play out as follows: fighter X repeats the same attack over and over again while fighter Y evades them until there's one strategic move employed by fighter Y which ends the fight without fighter X having a counter strategy. Not to mention that these fights are excessively interrupted with dialogue from spectators.
The tournament doesn't really do all that much for the characters either. Sure, you get to see everybody's powers (which we mostly saw already in the last 3 episodes of season 1) and see them interact some more, but the main purpose of it was just to move on to the internship which only lasted a few episodes anyway and then it was back to business as usual. The most notable thing to come out of it was fleshing out and developing Todoroki's character which was the only participant that had actual immediate  dramatic weight to him fighting in the tournament. 
Speaking of characters, they're all quirky, and vibrant as shonen characters should be and in a basic way of personality and appeal there's nothing really wrong with them. On the other hand they all have the same motivation of becoming a hero and with a lot of them it's for rather selfish reasons which are never called out on by their teachers (Student: ""I want to be a hero because BOOBS!"" Teacher: ""oh how charming"" ). 
Also the more the show goes on I started to notice that there's a huge lack of good character interactions. As far as I could tell, the vast majority of episodes (with the exception of maybe the opening episodes to an arc) consist of one scene of a minute or two (or much less) where characters interact in a casual way while the rest is made up of either exposition or mid battle lectures. I started to notice this because these interactions are the most enjoyable part for me. I thought it was cute when Deku was excited over talking to Uraraka on the phone because she's a girl.. Why did it have to take 3 episodes (of one scene in each) to get to the punchline of that interaction? Well I guess because the show is too busy with training sessions and tournaments..
The most prominent characters that started proper character arcs so far were Deku, Todoroki and Tenya. I'll just point out that I didn't like how Deku was handled. They make his childhood hero his mentor - he becomes his mentor's favorite boy - and the one unique trait he had which was NOT having a power is taken away. All of this happens in the span of the first few episodes and through convenient happenstance, so it feels like most of his arc is already behind him and that he already achieved what he wanted, which makes it harder to be invested in him as a character. Todoroki's backstory is a little weird for reasons I won't go in to because of spoilers, but I generally thought it was at least a step in the right direction and there were some ok dramatic bits with him. I guess the same can be said for Tenya. As for Uraraka, we get to know her motivation and background but that didn't seem to go anywhere yet. She's still best girl though. I know there's also the rival character but he's cliched and overdone, it's like the author didn't know how to make a believable character like this so he's just angry all the time even in situations in which he shouldn't be and hard to care about for that reason. 
We also have All Might who's seen as the ideal hero by pretty much everyone in the show (villains included) and we get a glimpse of what he's capable of in the beginning and end of season 1. And in season 2 we get some backstory for him which excuses why Deku of all people, is his favorite boy. Not a bad character, but since he's looked up to as such an ideal hero it would be nice to see him going out and doing heroic things without being forced to, instead of being shut in the school all day. He's more defined by the way other characters perceive him rather than his own actions.
The rest aren't really worth mentioning, they take up a lot of screen time and used for comic relief, and while some of them do have their own little character arcs that continue from the sidelines (which is good and all) there's still not enough in terms of any details that we know about them for me to have enough to talk about.
So basically the main characters in this show have about as much depth and personality as minor One Piece villains.. And really not much else can be said about the rest of them. To this show's credit though, I've definitely seen worse.
Speaking of villains, let's talk about the ones that were introduced (and actually did something) so far. Yes, All two of them.
The prominent one is.. Angry.. and itches his neck when he's angry.. and uh, he works for some guy.. and uh.. oh right he wants to kill All Might. yeah that about sums up what we know about him.
There's actually more to talk about with the less prominent one who appears only in season 2 for a few episodes which is the Hero Killer. His motivation makes a lot of sense for the world he's a part of and it's similar to my sentiment on the lack of heroism in this show that I brought up in the beginning of this review. There was potential with him to at least begin to address this issue, but the show doesn't seem to acknowledge that he may have a point and when Tenya (the character who confronts him) concedes that he's right and admits he's not a real hero... he only seems to be referring to himself for not preventing the hero killer from attacking someone near and dear to him, which he had no way of preventing anyway. 
So in the rest of season 2 this theme is dropped.. Will it resurface? I don't know and I'm not convinced that sticking around for it is worthwhile, after seeing how the show danced around this topic the first time. And understandably so because if the show acknowledges that this villain has a point, it's an admission that what it presented to us up until then - was shallow and dumb..
And with that, I think that's about all I have to say about the story, characters and themes.
Visually this show as a whole is pretty good but far from perfect and I would argue, somewhat unappealing. It has a nice and fittingly bright color pallet and it knows when to mute the colors when there's a darker scenario. The character designs are somewhat creative for sure since they all have different shapes and sizes but a lot of them are also made distinct by having one special feature to them that's kinda ugly like big lips or a frog face.  It can look pretty lame and ugly with some of them, especially when they're attached to otherwise normal looking designs.
Furthermore some characters are drawn with thicker outlines to the point where they look like they're from a different show.
In terms of backgrounds they're mostly made up of either generic school grounds or ok looking cities. 
The animation is above average and there is a noticeable improvement in season 2 when it comes to character motions. But this definitely is a downgrade for studio Bones since their shows are known for having fluid animation and great fighting choreography and this does not. Plenty of moments look dull with panning shots over still frames of people just standing around. Not to mention the action can look stiff with speed lines and Pokemon style flashing backgrounds being fairly frequent. To be fair, you could argue that this show is going for a classic comic book look, but I don't think the art is pretty or detailed enough to justify that style. 
I never had much trouble with the voice acting. All the kids sound enough like kids and adults sound like adults. The acting can get a little over the top and some voices are a little high pitched so it can get a little annoying but it's not too bad. It has some really nice and heroic sounding tracks, there's lot's of fast rock tunes and slower melancholic  ones mixed in but it doesn't quite sound like something you would listen to on your own and the ops and eds i found to be fairly average and unexciting with the exception of op 2 of season 2.
So overall I find this show unimpressive, fairly dull most of the time and even insulting to the super hero ideals I grew up with (or the basic definition of the word). I know many people feel very differently which is fair. And sure, it has some cool moments and it even raises some interesting questions but its answers seem to either be rooted in moral relativism or it just cops out from an answer all together. So I think I'll spare myself from watching season 3 thank you very much.",5,Hatul

                I decided to make this review at 20/25 because there really isn't much left in the season to talk about and I don't want to waste any more time watching this dreadful show.
***Story***: Boku No Hero Academia is severely lacking in this department.
There is no real point to watching Boku No Hero Academia season 2. Everything within the season is a complete one-off. The anime spends 12 episodes doing a sports event for no reason in-universe and certainly no substantial reason for the viewer to care.
The pacing in BNHA is terribly sluggish, even to the point of adding completely useless filler episodes that add nothing
                  to the world or events. 
The events can be summed up as follows: play sports for points, fight thug in an alley, filler. That's it. That's all that happened in 20 episodes and I'm willing to bet that's all that happens in the last 5. 
Note: I understand that it might be taken as an ""oversimplification"" but I'd like to take a bet that anything that happened in these 20 episodes couldn't happen in 2-3 and be done better. You know why I'd take this bet? Because it has been done, because you don't need 20 episodes to play sports and fight a thug in an alley.
*** Art ***: The art is ok. By ""ok"" I mean it's by-the-numbers shonen. Nothing interesting, nothing great, nothing terrible either. Some scenes are above average some are below.
For Studio BONES this is one of their worse looking shows though, especially compared to Kekkai Sensen which came out last year.
***Sound*** : Mediocre, nothing bad, nothing good.
***Character***: The focusing on an entire class is a very poor choice, adding another class on top of that creates even more disconnect from your ""main cast"". 
But that's not where it stops. Every charcter, EVERY character, is boring.
The powers are lame. The personality is shallow. Most importantly: Nobody matters.
There is a popular saying with the fanbase in that ""they are all best girls"" when talking about the female cast. This meme P E R F E C T L Y outlines how bland the girls of this series actually are.
Of course none of the girls matter, half of them are used for pure fanservice (literal cleavage and ass shots by the camera), and they are all given the most useless powers.
I'm not normally one to complain given how ridiculously powerful some characters in anime are, but for this series is makes no sense to not have ONE lead female character with a cool ability.
*** Enjoyment*** : MHA is boring and unoriginal.
Sure, you can be unoriginal. Jojo's Phantom Blood is unoriginal. But you can't be BORING.
And if BNHA is one thing, it's boring.
*** OVERALLL *** 3/10.
Don't bother watching it. There are plenty of other shows out there that TRY to be good and ARE good. BNHA is not one of them.",3,EmpirenXD

                HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE FUCKING HYPE
Almost every ep ends with a feeling where your heart doesn't stop racing and leaves you breathless; thirsting for more. Spring 2017 welcomes us to a not so old friend by the name deku and brings us to another season of HYPE, Boku no Hero Academia.
Story: 9/10
As one who has read the manga, i can say that the second season sticks to source but  makes it better. The first episode doesn't linger that much and brings us right to the next arc: the sports festival. all i could say without spoilers is that the anime really does
                  a great job of tweaking the manga to make the arc much better than it already is. the attention to every detail is what amazes me because even though its not that important to the story, the producers does a great job of making it contribute to whole story. in short in the words of gigguk: ITS A FUCKING TOURNAMENT ARC
Art: 10/10
I find it so appealing how the artstyle of Boku no hero is made. the way the teeth is incorporated to the character design is one of the reasons why i gave this a 10. well other reasons are the clean designs, spot on animations and the uniqueness of each character (well since this is a super hero anime) you can't find anything wrong with bones in this one.
Sound: 8/10
Nothing over the top, well made sounds, detailed bg noises and AMAZING choice of voice actors. one that sticks out to me the craft of our boy bakugou (okamoto) on how this particular voice actor fits his peronsality 10/10, same could be said with deku, all might and most of all the e-head/present mic combo. i am fully confident that this show would have a different taste on me if present mic was not commentating this arc. shit when the guy turns to speaking english, you know itd hype. same could be said with the witty banter of e-head alongside his explanations of quirkcs. side note: at first i thought all might had the same actor as might guy lol with all the youth shit lmaooooo
Character: 9/10
Alright if there is one thing you credit this anime for besides its story, its the characters. 2nd season intoduces us to a more wide variety of characters and shifts its development on the ""hero"" side rather than the students-quirk-school aspect. here we get to see new students from class b and without spoiling, you'll see that there are some pretty interesting faces that'll come by. shifting to the old cast, we finally get to see some depth to the other characters and we also get to see that not all of them are flawless. its outstanding we can get to witness backstories, developments, sentiments out of a tournament arc. you'll get to see that under those out of this world quirks, these people are still that, people.
Enjoyment: 100/10
ITS A FUCKING TOURNAMENT ARC BLAZING ANIMATIONS AMAZING VOICE ACTING FUCKING MATCH UPS THAT WE WANT TO SEE AND ITS ONLY THE 7TH EPISODE AND IM ON MY FUCKING KNEES WAITING FOR THE NEXT YOU COULD VERY MUCH SAY THAT I ENJOY THIS AND YOU WILL TOO MY FRIEND TRUST ME 
Overall: 9/10
Now now, the shows not yet over, there are still many arcs that this season will tackle and my final rating will be according to how this anime will handle that. so far however, this anime is doing a great job with the present arc. mate you got everything. great animation, great voice acting, writing, hype, action, hype, and ofc the 18+ only Hero Midnight. yeah you'll see A LOT of her. now isn't that enough to get you to watch this show or do i have to go one for all on your ass?
cheers.  oh and yeah ill be back mates when the seasons over",10,kuragure

                If there's one word I'd describe this season by it would be ""BEAST"". 
Unfortunately the first season of Boku No Hero Academia didn't live up to my expectations. The fights were minimal let alone good and didn't give leave me with interest for future episodes.
Now this season went far beyond my expectations...This is a next level of BEAST anime.
Story:
The story is at the UA sports festival arc. I won't lie it's slow paced if your'e looking for a story line. But it starts to heat up as new characters such as Endeavour are introduced and inter-linking relationships appear. So far, I have liked everything about
                  it, the arc is 10/10 enjoyment for me because every episode hypes you for the next and it just keeps getting better.
Art:
The same as the first season, it was pretty good. Todoroki and his Ice abilities start to look a bit more fascinating which is a major PLUS. Otherwise, it is completely the same.
Sound:
Amazing, I can't express how nice the OST's and ED are. Like you know those anime where once you've finished it and you listen to a soundtrack from it, it brings tears and reminiscence. I can't stop listening to the beast OST ""You say Run"".
Character:
Development starts with Deku, Todoroki, Bakugo and Uraraka. New characters are being introduced, I'm looking forward to this. No complaints.
Enjoyment:
Completely satisfied. Pumped for every week, if it keeps up I'm gonna rate this probably in my top 5 anime.
Overall:
Outstanding. I really can't explain all the things which happens in this season because it would reveal major spoilers. All I can say if you're reading this and haven't watched this series, start the first season asap. And if you have done that go straight to this season, you won't be let down for a FACT.
Thanks.",10,Papermate

                I really did try to go into this with a positive attitude. I wanted to like it. This season could have very well been 12 episodes instead of the excruciatingly drawn out 25. Really all that tells me is VERY. POOR. WRITING. With this show being so popular and having such a high MAL score I had high expectations. I am being sorely let down. I didn't even want to finish watching this season. I usually only drop shows if it is boring me to death. I was almost to my limit with this one. 
Lets hop to the spoilers.
Story: A mess. It is all
                  over the place. I mostly only kept watching because I want to know WHY this universe is how it is. Why is everyone mutated? How did the world react in the beginning? We finally saw a glimpse of the world's (japan's) reactions, at the end? of the 2nd season? How does that make sense. Maybe they did that so people would keep watching their flaming pile of garbage. There are so many gaps that need to be filled. I feel like they are just writing from the seat of their pants without much of a plan, a *basic* plot to follow. They ruin the action packed anime they seem to want by drawing everything out. The season started out interesting with the sports festival, the obstacle race was really the highlight of the season. But come on, do we really need 1 episode for every single 1v1? no. 
Art: It really hasn't changed or improved since the first season. It is nothing novel. It's like if they animated Yu-Gi-Oh! with the software we have today. The eyes bug me less this season, though they still take up more of their face than eyes in Clannad; that's an accomplishment. 
Sound: The dub is the only reason for a decent score. I've had my volume the same level watching this entire season and wow does it randomly get loud and quiet and all over the place. 
Character: ahahhah what character? Deku, the glorified narrator. Yay we finally got everyone's favorite tortured soul's story. But.. IcyHot got over his daddy issues in a few short minutes because some kid he barely knows is yelling at him. ""Jk my dad wasn't so bad I'm going to spend all summer with him cy@"" He had potential to be a beautiful tragic backstory character but they seem afraid to get into anything deep here. Everyone's favorite Shouty McShout kind? of? tried to get a back story. Bakugo: Origins. Are you kidding? That was all footage we saw in the first season... there's no new info here.  l a z y. 
Enjoyment: Condensed, the story is interesting enough to barely finish. Since everyone is obsessed with this show I expected better. Fandom ruins things though. 
Overall: It's so much longer than necessary. The repetition. I mean, finally Wimpy did SOMETHING useful in the very end, but it was a little too easy. I'm sick of seeing cue-ball eyes all over my dash. cant wait till this fad is over. I see it going the ways of SAO. Everyone freaks out about how good a show is.. then a few months, a year, and it's a meme for how awful the story actually was. the hype will die. eventually. and then we can be in peace once more.",4,AmericaWasntLost
33486,"
                The shounen that took Naruto's place was a huge disappointment for me and I will try to explain why here. I do not think that this review will change a lot of opinions, but I found it fun to write this, so here is a piece of my mind.
Starting off with the... start: the setting.
From the very beginning what I noticed is that there is a distinct lack of effort put into the setting and the world-building in general. The story takes place in a world where everyone has these quirks and those with useful ones in battle become heroes. Makes sense... But you know…
                  Starting from the acquirement of quirks to the establishment of a society that functions is a veeeeery long way, which was all completely missed.
In this season, we do get some hints about certain things that happened in the past, but instead of answering important questions we just get more of them. All the details regarding the events which involve All-For-One are missed and yes I understand that there will be a follow-up later in the anime, but the whole thing barely seems believable when you start asking questions like “Why?” and “How?”. From a technical perspective, nothing makes sense and we as an audience have to just move ahead and swallow it.
The next thing in this 'world' that was extremely poorly handled was the Heroes vs Villains theme. In this show, it is presented as the most basic and boring Good vs Evil clash. The way this anime handles its villains is simply disgusting and their motivations are so non-existent....... with one exception. This is where I want to give Hero Aca its low amount of credits - Stain. I'd go as far as say that this is the most well-handled character in the series with a motivation that makes perfect sense. There is also some foreshadowing about the hand guy's motivation, but he is so over the top edgy that I hardly consider that to be a character.
As for the quality of the actual story... *sigh*
It is very basic and simplistic, which in itself is not a bad thing... unless it's full of plot holes... which, HEY, it actually is...
Not only that the quirk mechanic is clearly not explored enough, we even have a villain with teleportation power! Isn't that the best way to pull anything out of your backdoor? By the way, if you think about it... there is no way that guy can lose... ever... unless the plot says so...
And this is not the only offender in this regard - Deku easily predicts the future and then defies the laws of physics in the very first arc of the season; Todoroki getting super nerfed for unknown reasons in the fight against Deku; the mind control guy getting hacked out by the power of the Main Character because FkU; Deku's instant no-effort powerup; Stain attacking Iida's brother for unknown reasons (considering Stain's motivation) etc. etc. I won’t get into specifics to keep the spoilers minor.
All these and other small details keep adding up throughout the duration of the show making everything that happens less and less believable.
The next things in the story to take a look at are the themes Hero Aca tried to explore. I could find a few main ones and let’s take them one by one.
Heroism
Somewhat okay-ish handled in my opinion and it does have its really good moments periodically.
Starting with the good part – the anime clearly tells on many occasions that Heroes INSPIRE others and not only save them in dire situations. Heroes are symbols and enforcers of peace and are the target for a human’s basic need – to admire someone/something. The show never hesitates to make All-Might explain the reason why he smiles which is a pretty nice thing overall.
This is also where the Stain arc goes in and scores some points for this anime, saving it from being horrible. Without spoiling the thing… Really well executed, believable and relatable – a solid commentary on what it means to be a hero and finally draws that small grayish line in the whole Good vs Evil issue.
The problems on this topic mostly include the one I mentioned above about villains (WHICH IS A HUGE ISSUE) and some questionable things about the education of the heroes and by that I mean the whole existence of Bakugo.
Hard work / Working for your dream
A complete joke since season 1. The whole idea of working hard is undermined by the very fact that the Main Character gets the super powa just because he’s good. There are some training sequences, but the only huge power spikes are achieved through ass-pulled power ups. Extremely cheap and lazy overall.
The Todoroki thing
Here I refer about the whole parents forcing their dreams upon their children, despite their wishes. If I ignore some technical issues, this is handled fairly well and I really loved the conclusion that Todoroki reaches in the end.
This would really be something nice if only Endeavor wouldn’t be such a 1-dimensional ass. Sadly, this fact just undermines the whole issue and all I can say is that it could’ve been so much better.
And now I got to the biggest issue of this show – THE CHARACTERS.
Simply, horrible. Bland, uninteresting and almost everyone is defined by one quirk (pun intended).
The whole attention of the show is focused solely on Deku, which to be honest, simply gets obnoxious. Everyone else is given so small attention! I still remember how that same Naruto (before it became horrible) focused on its side cast and fleshed it out down to its core. What do we get here….? Absolutely nothing. Nothing matters besides Deku. Deku is the center of the world. Even the fights in the tournament arc took place in a flash as if to fast forward to the important part, which is DEKU.
One could obviously argue that the show also focuses on Todoroki and Iida, but to be honest… even in those parts, it is very easy to follow what the thing is focusing on (*cough* Deku being such a good guy *cough*).
And now Deku himself is a huge problem as well. He follows the same bland shounen self-insert protagonist formula without a single unique trait. He is as typical as a character in anime can ever get and there is literally nothing to talk about here.
And finally the execution of the show… To describe the feeling I got here – LOW EFFORT.
Everything in this anime screams of lack of attention to any kind of detail.
The art style is maximum simplistic as if to make a joke about how bland the characters are. The villains even look as evil as they possibly can…
If you’re going to look for any details in the character behavior or certain situations – HA HA HA. None. Everything is extremely straightforward and dumbed down as much as possible.
The good part here is the music… and damn it is so catchy. The OPs are great, EDs are fine, “You Say Run” does most of the job in crucial moments and the timing on the OST usage is great. The Deku vs Todoroki scene is executed brilliantly and is the only awesome moment in the anime (including season one).
By the way… I still couldn’t forget that horrible Deku crying scene from the first season, which was executed in the most disgusting way possible. I think a kid with actual autism wouldn’t look as bad. Also, going back to the issues with details starting with season one... One more striking detail is how bland the One-For-All quirk is… Simply, power. Goooooing baaaaack to our Deku being a bland self-insert issue……
One more thing that strikes me about this show is how it is afraid to have actual progress. It tries to keep its status-quo as much as possible all the time while slooooowly progressing with the main conflict.
To explain better what I mean, I’ll take the Stain arc.
In this arc, Iida gets the same treatment that Todoroki does in the tournament arc, aka DEVELOPMENT. But where the show succeeded in the first case, it completely failed in the Iida case. What happens here is that Iida just goes back to his normal state that he had, right before the arc started. Not only that, but the whole damage he creates by screwing up is as minimal as it can get. Unlike the Todoroki case, there are no real consequences to this whole issue except that moving the main plot slightly forward.
So, overall… This season did a better job than season one, which was literally a bunch of “nothing happens”. It finally tried to do something and had a few themes to explore. Some of them were handled okay-ish and some worse, but the main issues that I had with the show since the first season are still there: a terribly bland cast, a cheap plot with no attention to details or world-building and a striking simplicity in literally everything to the point of insulting the viewer’s intelligence.",4,Valik93

                After the great first season a year prior, there's no question that this new season of Boku no Hero Academia would garner a lot of hype and attention. But does it deserve the attention its previous season bought it or is it simply another cookie cutter shounen action show to scratch our generic action craving itches for the season? After watching nearly everything this season of Hero Aca has to offer I can safely say that this season goes far and beyond what the first season and most shounen shows do and that makes for one hell of a shounen show.
Story: 8 (Great)
While the first
                  season featured a quite standard origin story for our main character which was never particularly spectacular, it did feature some interesting plot points and tackled a few questions such as what it is like to be an outcast and what it means to learn to live with the differences between you and the world. The second season builds upon everything the show had set up and explores themes of morality, differing ideologies and perhaps most importantly social legacy. Hero Aca season 2 is directed in such a brilliant way that since the first season managed to set up and develop such a wonderful cast of characters season 2 can easily use these characters to convey the messages the show wants to by delving into these themes. This just happens to work nearly perfect and makes every new arc and subplot of season 2 a joy to get engulfed by. Yet, Hero Aca season 2, in the same fashion as season 1, doesn't do a lot that hasn't been done already. 
Characters: 9 (Fantastic)
Usually, in action shounen shows the supporting cast takes a backseat to the main character(s). Because of this, their motivations, agendas and backstories are never properly explored. This was not the case in Boku no Hero Season 1 and fortunately for us isn't either in Season 2. With a greater emphasis on the supporting cast and their backstory and personality comes a greater depth to the plot and world itself as the people occupying the story feel as real as the main cast. This is not to say that the main characters of Boku no Hero Season 2 get too little attention or time spent on what they want or feel or think. I believe that Boku no Hero has always had a good sense of balance of how much focus each character needs, supporting and main characters both, to make them feel relevant while keeping the show from seemingly having the world orbit around a certain character. In short, the way the show devises up its runtime among  show has found a good balance of time spent on each character. The characters aren't without flaws however. Most of the shows cast are based on standard shounen tropes which can be almost painfully obvious at times. Hero Aca season 2 makes use of an incredibly simple technique of developing its characters, which is by showing rather than telling, a technique that has been unfortunately more and more ignored in the action shounen genre. By doing this, Hero Aca develops some of the deepest characters I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know. 
Animation: 9 (Fantastic)
Let's just start off by saying that I thought that both the art style and animation looked great in the first Season of Boku no Hero, though it wasn't close to flawless. That said, I think that this season ups its predecessor in every single way. The animation and movements of the characters is now more expressive and static shots are less frequent than the first season. Movement is also more fluid while retaining or in some cases even improving upon the detail found in the first season. The animation and movement of the characters all have a certain added weight to them compared to season 1 which, along with the fantastic voice acting and character writing, helps turn these characters into real, believable people. I can not talk about the animation of Hero Aca without mentioning the absolutely jaw dropping fight scenes. This show features animation to match even the best looking shows out there like One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100, both of which, incidentally, were animated by studio Bones so the fact that this show also looks absolutely stunning shouldn't come as a surprise. 
Sound: 8 (Great)
As I am no expert of sound design I don’t have much to say other than that the show sounds great which any high profile show should in 2017. The voice acting is as good as it was previously and all characters manage to express great emotion which is conveyed to me with ease despite the language barrier. Most of the shows music works well with its scenes and aids the scene to have a greater effect on the viewer. Also, both the OPs and EDs are fantastic. Some of the best this year in my opinion. 
Enjoyment: 9 (Fantastic)
I have to admit that shounen shows are a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine, especially the ones made by Bones, so I might be a slight bit biased when thinking about Boku no Hero but I swear to god if this show isn't entertaining as all hell. There hasn't been a single time that I haven't cussed at the ED as the credits started to roll because I was so convinced that it had only been 5 minutes since I started the episode. When a 22 minute episode feels like 5 you know that you enjoyed it almost a bit too much. There is very little that I don't love about this show.
Overall: 8 (Great)
""But does it deserve the attention its previous season bought it or is it simply another cookie cutter shounen action show to scratch our generic action craving itches for the season?"" Yes. Yes it deserves all the attention it can get 100 times over. Boku no Hero Academia season 2 is superior to its first season, and a large majority of other shounen action shows, in most ways I can think of and will surely entertain even the pickiest of viewers.",9,TheSatox

                I'm writing this review mostly because of the insane fight Todoroki vs Midoriya in the 10th episode. As long as I've read the manga till the last chapter (for now) and I know what is next, I say one thing - I'M JUST DYING TO SEE THE ANIMATION OF THE NEXT EVENTS AS PERFECT AS IT WAS IN THE FIGHT TODOROKI/MIDORIYA!!~~~<3 
Hell yeah this anime makes goosebumps with its story, animation, SOUND (!!!!) and characters development. I like the anime about school, but only two animes  (Assassination Classroom) were able to develope ALL the characters equally, even the supporting ones. It is brilliant and
                  tend to see the story!! Overall score for this anime is definetly 10/10. This is the end of my small and complex review!! Enjoy the watching!",10,NICK1994

                So I don't really write reviews for MAL but after catching up on the 2nd season of Boku no Hero Academia I finally feel compelled to do so. My first impression of the first season of Hero Aca was somewhat of a disappointment. Although it was definitely a cut above other shonen manga adaptations, I expected much more from the same studio that produced FMAB and Mob Psycho 100. Although the artwork was flashy and the soundtrack was impressive, the pacing was staggered, non-action related artwork appeared flat and lifeless, and characters were introduced too quickly without being given time to fully develop. Season 2
                  of Hero Aca remedies nearly all of the problems, turning it into one of the best shounen anime's I have seen in a long time.
The story so far is a standard tournament arc with a simple premise: students have the opportunity to show of their quirks and abilities to potential recruits by competing in a sports tournament. This premise is nothing groundbreaking, but its simplicity allows the series to be the almost entirely character driven rather than event driven. Once flat characters like uraraka are given poignant motivations that make their actions much more engaging while side characters like Kaminari, Kirishima, and Tokoyami are finally given distinct personalities and traits, making them add to the production instead of merely fill space. The star of these side characters, however, is far and wide todoroki whose backstory and pain brought tears to my eyes
The artwork has also dramatically improved as well. While the action scenes look amazing, the general character gestures add a whole new level of enjoyment. The animator take Bakugo, who annoyed the crap out of me originally, and amp his anger and cold personalty up to 100 through various facial expressions are sharp linework, making bakugo an absolute delight to watch when he is engulfed in rage. Iida's rapid hand movements contrasted with his serious nature turns him from an annoying side character into a loveable giant nerd. Even Tokoyami's serious nature contrasted with his whimsical birdlike appearance is a spectacle. Deku's facial expressions have improved dramatically as well\.
The sound is just as amazing as always with the music reaching a crescendo during the most intense fights spine, always sending shivers down my spine. The opening and ending never fail to get me hyped as well
Overall, it is an understatement to say I have enjoyed the second season of hero aca. The only reason I am reluctant to give it a perfect score is that the current arc has ended and it is hard to see how the next arc will top the last, but with the way things are playing out with the intriguing new villain slain, things seem to be going on the right track.  I have high hopes that Hero Aca will usher in a new era of shonen anime. PLUS ULTRA!",9,jballot1234

                (You must see season 1 first before you go to reviews of the 2nd season because there will be some spoilers about season 1.There will be some spoilers also from Season 2)
Heroes Vs Villains. Good Vs Evil. We are always presented by these topics. Whether it is a movie, tv show, soap opera, or even anime itself, it is quite common and typical. But even though it is common on almost every shows out there, we still can't get enough whether the good guys or the bad guys will win on the last episode of the series or film.
Last year, the anime community was hitted
                  by a ''meteor'' in Spring 2016. A meteor that brought as another shounen anime, trying to compete to countless shounen anime out there. That's right. I am talking about 'Boku No Hero Academia' or 'My Hero Academia'. We were all shocked that how did we love watching a very simple storyline of an anime like this one. Boy don't have any superpowers but he is still determined to become a hero like his favorite hero someday. Then after through hardwork and some help of his favorite hero he got in to a school of superheroes. Easy story, but almost all of us loved it. Boku No Hero Academia last year showed us that even you write a simple story, there is a chance that people will love it if you put your heart into it.
Now I am not going to talk about Season 1 here cause it is already over. We moved on already. The boy is now a student on a hero academy then of course, the 'incident' was finished. This begs the question. ''What are the things that will happen so far?''. Well this question will be answer if you watch the latest one which is ''Boku No Hero Academia 2nd Season''.
The 2nd season's story is quite different than season 1, but the setting is almost the same. At the first season, the author presented the main protagonist to be a boy named 'Midoriya, Izuku', who dreams to become a superhero like his most favorite hero 'All Might'. Although, most children like Midoriya should have 'Quirks' already (Mostly in kindergarten), basically, superhuman powers. If someone has a quirk, of course he/she can be a hero. With just a little hardwork, he/she can. But unfortunately, he doesn't have a quirk.. He was ''Quirkless''. This world where Midoriya lives on, is also painful. Villains.. That's right.. If there are heroes, there will be villains obviously. Some take their powers as a chance to do inappropriate things by the law like stealing and causing damage to property, then some are using it for terrorism like what happened to the climax of the first season where the villains attacked the training grounds of the academy.
So I gave you a brief summary of season 1 I guess. Season 2, however, is all about competition. The school of Midoriya is no different to our schools on real life. Our schools always host competition whether the students on the same school body fight with their minds or against other schools. On this school competition (But it's called a sports festival on the series and it's one of the most famous ones by the setting of the story), all the characters showed resolve towards their one goal. To be ''No. 1'' on the competition. 
The showing of their quirks was quite splendid throughout the battles whether it is the race, group/team battle, then the most awaited one which is the 1 vs 1 tournament. We saw the developments of some characters like Midoriya where he can fight against a recommended student like 'Todoroki Shouto', who is more powerful than him. But he still motivated him to fight him seriously without hiding any potential power. Another character who developed the prowess of determination was 'Uraraka, Ochako'. She, who uses gravity manipulation (but still don't know how to use it properly), was quite not a good match for 'Bakugou, Katsuki', who has a very powerful quirk called 'Explosion'. With the huge power difference and potential, Uraraka was sure she will lost but because her desire gets her the determination to almost beat him.
Even though there are some who developed from the Tournament arc, there were some who falls down a bit. Yeah. The losers of course. This is what I call character development as its finest. All of the characters in the tournament were developing traits, friendship and teamwork even though it is a competition. Also, this tournament arc offers us another important element for characters called ''balance'' or ''character balance''. In many shows, we expect the main protagonist to win any fight he can. In this one however, almost everyone were like the main characters where we were presented by their purpose and resolve throughout the episodes.
 It was not only about Midoriya and all, even the supporting ones were participating. Also, I (or maybe you) thought that Midoriya will win in the  1v1 tournament, but making him win was inappropriate to the storyline so the author decided to ''thrown-off'' Midoriya awhile. This was a good decision base on the facts involve to other characters like Todoroki's inevitable half-cold, half-hot power. But of course, that was a sports festival. The real trial comes when they go out there to society with the heroes teaching them what will happen. What will really happen when a villain attacks a society where heroes are there. This was also a training for the students of class 1-A of the hero course. On this part, I was like ''Finally.. He learned how to use it properly''. If you watched season 2, you might feel the same as I do. There were so many to talk about this series not only the tournament. The battle against the hero killer was one of the most important one here. Its hidden meaning to heroes and villains were inspirational making them both stronger. 
Hero Killer Stain motivating villains at the end while the 3 students Midoriya, Todoroki and Iida learned that teamwork and calmness were the key to defeat a villain and vengeance should not be tolerated by someone who calls themselves a hero. The final exam shows the viewers how heroes should have the mind working with your teammate to try, avoid, and overcome their enemys' quirks and the trials ahead. With Bakugou and Midoriya teaming up against the most powerful hero out there which is 'All Might' for the exam, we all have seen how both of them changed from all the events happened in the school of heroes. It is not only the heroes who improved, but the villains as well. The so-called ''League Of Villains'' that attacked the U.A students last season is back and more serious on getting the head of 'All Might'. With the hero killer giving inspiration to potential villains out the society, we can expect they will make a move soon.
Season 1 was all about the starting-point of our characters' journey to the path of becoming a hero. Season 2 was all about the efforts, trials, problems and how they solve it efficiently with determination, teamwork and hardwork. I don't have to tell about the characters, art, sound, and enjoyment because I think you already have a guess that all of them are perfect combinations of the story itself. I will not say season 2 was better than season 1 but I think season 2 is pretty damn enjoyable then season 1 because we get to see good fights, character developments and all other stuffs not only from the hero side, to the villain side as well. So overall, I gave this anime a 10/10. What a masterpiece it is.",10,Zaber_san

                Uh ok, so ... the only progress from Midoriya we see is after season 1, and after the first part of season 2? Is this a joke right? i mean... all of these episodes full of blah blah and fights, that made Todoroki have more mental progress than Midoriya. The MC keeps being a chiken after what we saw happened in first season, he is still full of openings like we saw through the whole story, but specially at that last episode.
Story. 4/10
What can i say, the first part of the whole thing aka the School Festival was boring, but let just say that the
                  race and the chavalry competition were pretty boring while the Tournament was only boring. I would've loved to see more of the other side of the story, the author likes a lot midoriya and i get, he wants us to see his progress but there has not been remarkable progress since he got his powers from All Might. I want to see what happens to the others but with detail, not simple 10 secs of the other characters in where we see nothing but them talking on how Midoriya would act, like, be serious for once. Same goes for the tournament, and that's about it for the first part. 
Then comes the second part and the one i think it's good, when we get to see Midoriya make progress in a long time. He finally got to control a small portion of his powers. We finally got to see more Pro Heroes in action such as Todoroki Adult as well as Gran Torino, althought from the last i guess they didn't show much considering he is an old man (?). The point of the whole arc, is Stain. His conviction was the worst if you ask me, same goes to Tomura. ""Killing with a reason"" ""You are not a hero if you don't save someone"" and etc. Such a generic commonly used topic for villains who try to fight the good guys. His thinking aside, his fight with the 3 students (Midoriya, Todoroki and Tenya) was full of the thinking already said, more than action it was more of a try to get them to think the same way as Him (Stain), in which case Tenya ended up being by his side (Only by his conviction), Action-wise it was pretty how they executed it, really clean and smooth compared to season 1. You the ending of this already, with the stress of Stain's Will passed into everyone and blah blah, ending the whole arc and starting a new bomb.
Next (ARC), we got a filler that was incredibly boring showing us how it was the other characters did their practice and surprise!!!! We actually got to see the other characters, since the author won't show us, the Animation Studio had to do something about it!. We got some small portions of test they made for a training camp that is coming of some sort, we got some new villains introduced and that's about it, that's the whole season 2 for you. It was decent at most. 
Art and Sound: 6/7 out of 10
From the animation, to the drawing, this was clearly way better than first season, it was smooth and clear but at some times it felt confusing trying to figure out were they were fighting or their positions and stuff. The drawings were pleasant, first season was full of deformed backgrounds and deformed characters, but now we got the same, but in better quality.
Character development... 3/10 but i already said something about it in the Story part.
Overall: 5

                I'll be honest here and say that the first season of BNHA wasn't that great but I enjoyed 10/10 even getting into the fandom but the second season had pulled of the adaption of the manga so well. And this time the arcs we'll be getting are the sport festival, Stain villain and the end of term test. 
(Just going to mention that I have read the manga)
Story (8/10):
When it comes to the story so far since I've seen 14 eps, the sport festival arc has concluded but this arc is actually regarded and the least enjoyed arc and is childish (but is to be
                  expected). But I am actually quite excited for the Stain villain arc which also has much more action involved and is more serious. The arc after that I like to view as a tool for character development which is going to be interesting to see how well it's pulled off.
Art (9/10):
Now the art is what actually made this season of BNHA appear much more better than the last one. (A good example is during the fight of Midoriya and Todoroki). The art for this season has improved by a milestone making it much more animated and nice to look at. Last season there were many times when scenes weren't animated enough which made the scenes much less engaging but this time my eyes weren't off the screen for a second. This is the result of different people animating this time from last season even though it's the same studio.
Sound (9/10):
The first opening by Peace Sign I'll say isn't memorable for me but still decent and same for the ending. But the second op which I actually really like and enjoy  and fits so perfectly for the arcs involved. For the second ending which is actually done by LiSA (one of my favs lol), has made a pretty good ending. (I wanna say that I actually love that they used the idea from the second popularity poll which I think is like a fantasy AU). Also the soundtracks included are pretty good.
Character (9/10):
Now in terms of character, the anime pulls it off so well. The main development you should look at this season is at Midoriya (obvs since MC), Todoroki, Iida and Momo. The devlopment and growth the anime gives is at such a great pace with good understanding of each problem a character faces. They especially did a great job at Todoroki (but hey, we never know so let's see).
Enjoyment (10/10):
This anime made me enjoy every second of it and I was not disappointed of every new ep also I would anxiously wait and those 20 min felt like 10 min instead. Saying that I decided to read the manga and oh boi am I glad I did. 
Overall (9/10):
The first arc was pulled off well and I'm expecting great things from the rest of this season. I applaud this anime especially for its art and character.",9,rae-dar

You hypocritical pieces of shit!! Such an unoriginal and annoying anime! It overuses some of anime's most annoying tropes. They took the worst characteristics of all the Shounen MCs from the past 10 years and created Midoriya....one of the most frustrating characters I have ever come across. Makes this one of the most overrated shows in Anime history. I really don't understand the charm of a nerdy coward, who is very very unrealistically nice to everyone. Although have to

Before the review I am gonna say this: Bones knows how to make a great  shounen anime that gives you a bump of adrenaline and boils your blood with each fight.Season 2 was awesome and we need more anime like this on the market!                                                       
                   
Season 2 is what I was earning for all this time as a fan of this series , everything was done right starting with the side characters who got development, the directing and writing who improved a lot since season 1 and also the fights who I must say are the best thing from this anime. Season 1 lacked all of those things but season 2 came in strong and made us all forget how bad and generic season 1 was , for that I wanna praise the staff who worked on this season.
Boku no Hero Academia is a shounen anime with generic characters  but what makes it different from other shounen anime like Bleach , Naruto  or One Piece? The answer is simple….this anime focuses on  the very essence of what a hero means , how it affects the society , how is it perceived by it , how is treated and presents the ideals and morals that they fight for as heroes . It doesn’t turn into a level power up shounen where everybody who shouts louder is stronger and defeat the enemy. The characters are not overpowered at all their quirks are vulnerable and have a lot of stakes involved after they use them which this is the most satisfying part for me as a viewer .They are more realistic and give you the “human like” feeling that you can resemble yourself in them. They made mistakes , they have regrets they know what pain tastes like and finally they give  everything for a better tomorrow like we all do in real life don’t we? Amazing!
Let’s talk about the characters who in this season have a lot of improvement and they managed to get us emotionally attached to their stories .The viewer can also get easily attached and resemble in them because each character is a manifestation of your own weak and strong points. First I am gonna mention one of my favorites moments and character from this season Todoroki  and the clash of ideals between him and Deku during their fight. That fight was so well used to flesh out the whole character of Todoroki , his ideals for what he was fighting until now his whole reason to be there and say proudly :”I want…to be a hero, too…!”.                                                                                                                                                            
As I mentioned the side characters finally get characterization and have their own spotlight during the whole 25 episodes in season 2. Urara , Tokoyami, YaoYorozu are not plot devices anymore used for the development of Deku they have their own motivations and reasons to be a hero and the anime shows that . Deku also gets improvement and we get to know more about him other than his crybaby moments that ruined season 1 overall for many of us .I like that this season doesn’t forget his conflict with Bakuo from season 1 and goes deeper into their bond and show us why they have polar opposites personality. And finally we get a villain who has solid motivations and reasons to fight against those who lack those kind of things thus for his own ideology.
The fights in Boku no Hero Academia are not an exchange of fists or skills to show who is more dominant , they are used to flesh out the personalities and quirks of each hero but also the most important thing their whole reason as a hero. Each skill and fist is an exchange of ideals between our characters , they show each other how they improved and the pain they endured to achieve that , the perseverance and motivations that keep them moving on all combined with the perfect choice of words and flashbacks to emphasize the message and emotional atmosphere: ”You don’t have to be a prisoner of  your blood, it’s okay for you to become who you want to be”. Brilliant!                                                                                             
The ost is just amazing in this anime , the opening song animation describes with accuracy the quirks and personality of each character from Boku no Hero Academia are and makes you expect great things before each episode. 
Boku no hero academia overall is a damn motivational anime ,  with characters that you can resemble yourself in and easy get attached to their own stories, with great ost and visuals , with well handled fights and finally with the perfect message for its audience. LOVE IT!",9,kokuborou

‘My Hero Academia S2’ shows us the true meaning of the word ‘HERO’! They don’t just present it on a Black and White scale, rather we are shown all sides of it, the good, the bad and the ugly! The story neatly captures the show’s concept of a Hero which is they come in all shapes, often birthed by violence as pointed out in one episode. And the trend of showcasing what it takes to be a true Hero is continued from S1 as we experience through the eyes of the students what sacrifices, commitments and lengths are needed
                  to be taken. After the amazing S1 of ‘My Hero Academia’, my expectations were sky high and they started off with a bang! Immediately we are thrown into a Sports Festival where the students of UA are to compete. This is quickly followed by the arc of the much-awaited villain, Stain after which they conclude with the Final Exams. With so much plot to cover, I was a little afraid they might rush everything but thankfully nothing of that sort happened due to more number of episodes! All plots surprisingly were darker and mature and were expressed in an exciting way, to the point where you once again ignore some of the anime’s clichéd aspects. I was impressed wholeheartedly with the story, including all its twists and turns like Midoria’s final position in the Sports Festival to the outcome of the Final Examination tests. And the dialogues were superb this time, from delivering the bone chilling intensity during Stain’s monologue to the totally upbeat and heroic feeling whenever Midoria is overcoming an obstacle. One of the complaints from S1 was the lack of focus on the supporting students which is fixed this time around with more spotlight on those characters! And if this doesn’t satisfy you, then we even get to see snippets of the various types of quirks from the UA teachers as well! (At least 1 of the teachers is definitely going to astonish you!) I enjoyed this addition to the story a lot because we get to see the student’s strengths and weaknesses with their quirks. We also learn the limitations that everyone has no matter how powerful their quirk is so it was fun to watch characters discover this about themselves and then try to overcome it. Showing this side of the students made them vulnerable to an extent, thus making them more humane, more relatable. And All Might’s barely in this season which was a little annoying at first since I like him so much but once I realized it was all done for a purpose, I was simply amazed at how deep the story is progressing! Once again some of the dialogues from All Might were spectacular to behold since they carried so much weight and had so many meanings! 
As for the characters, Stain was a stand out. (He’s so much like Punisher!) Stain’s reveal at the end of S1 had my hopes up but his introduction here was just okay. Thinking that I had been fooled in buying into the hype, I was pleasantly stunned by the turn of events! Stain delivers on the HYPE! He’s such a grey character, interestingly giving off a vibe of an Antihero. This unhinged character presented himself as a formidable opponent to our MC’s, thus making him excitedly dangerous and so very much appealing. And even though his morals are questionable but it makes sense in his own crazy way because after all there was some wisdom of truth in his maniacal vision of justice! Since Iida’s arc is tied with Stain so I will move on to him next. He went to some dark places this time, totally logical since he was blinded by vengeance to the point where he was ready to kill someone! Iida comes very close to doing something he would regret for the rest of his life but what I find funny is how it was Stain, of all people, to open his eyes back to reality! The cute gravity girl, Uraraka also gets some growth which is needed since it looks like she might be falling for someone! Other students get their moments to shine with the one exception, Bakugou. I don’t know whether they are saving him for next season or what but he got the least amount of time or development. Though we do get a glimpse of his motivation and the love/hate relationship that exists between him and the MC. Todoroki got his own intense backstory which fleshed him out to a cool and sympathetic character, involving many emotional moments due to his tragic history. In fact, he was the real show stealer during the 1st arc of the season! And he finally manages to overcome his demons by clearing a path for himself with the help of yours truly, Midoria. Izuku Midoria is front center once again and I loved every second of it cause he’s such a likable underdog hero. Seeing him improve so much from last season was a breath of fresh air for now he doesn’t just resort to one big punch! And the curtain is finally swung open to reveal the origin of ‘One for All’! Now we know what’s in store for young Midoria but he’s worth rooting for since his obligation to his goal of becoming the best hero is unwavering. Thankfully his motives aren’t belittling to any selfish desires except that he just wants to help people like All Might. All Might’s is not at the center of the show unlike S1 yet his part is just as pivotal to the main arc! It’s clearly established that All Might isn’t portrayed as a person to everyone, rather he’s looked upon as an ideal! Proving that it’s all about the message that’s being presented to the world, the message being ‘Inspiration’! This is the greatest gift from All Might for it’s this exact message which resulted into inspiring the younger generation into becoming Heroes! It’s this idea that gives hope to the people, thus bringing smiles upon their faces. It’s this motivation which fetches fear into the hearts of every villain, after all he is the symbol of justice. Unfortunately, All Might will not be with us for long so that ideal of justice is in danger and if it’s destroyed, all hell will break lose! Society will crumble as despair spreads and the reign of villains shall begin. Deep stuff! Coming back to the show, I enjoyed when All Might face his students for the Final exam, it’s just ridiculous how strong he really is! And you get first-hand glimpse of how hopeless a villain feels when facing against All Might! In my review for S1, I made a comparison of All Might to Superman but with the dark undertones presented here and the kind of villains to come, All Might come across more like Batman this time! As for the other villain, Shigaraki, he once again only plays a small role despite establishing himself as a serious threat to heroes in S1 but he has a bigger role to play in the future.
The artwork is on par with S1, giving off the comic book vibe, as if the manga pages leapt out of the sheets! But the animation is super stylish and classy with its spectacular array of lively colours, especially the battles during the Sports Festival comes to mind which were stunningly designed. We had 2 OP’s and 3 ED’s and while none of it stood out unlike S1, they still manage to leave an impression. The small contributions of gestures with Voice Acting really goes a long way as they further develop the characters. All do great work with their Voice work but Christopher Sabat still stands out with his impression of All Might.
The call-backs to S1 weren’t overdone, rather they were played to a minimum and used in the right places. It’s hard to come up with any misfires from this season since its near perfect, so you must really nit-pick! Unlike S1, the last episode is downplayed to actually resolve the main arc and some may not agree with this. I was totally riveted by the last episode and was on the edge of my seat during Shigaraki’s part! To turn this wannabe villain to a real threat is no easy task and for the show to accomplish that in just 1 episode is commendable for now this sinister person has his eyes on destroying All Might! Another plot I absolutely loved was the relationship between All Might and Midoria which has changed so much from S1. They made me grasp something that was always on the tip of my tongue but I never fully realized until now, which is the way how Midoria looks up to All Might! From both season’s OP video’s, you can tell the look of admiration and inspiration All Might seems to be for Midoria. But during the internship arc, they brought to my attention that Midoria actually admires All Might to the point where Midoria looks at him as a GOD! And for Midoria to witness that isn’t the case, for him to see that All Might wasn’t able to save him, for All Might to admit himself that he can’t save everyone must have really opened Midoria’s eyes. After all, All Might is just a human and his Godlike status is crumbling fast which is why the way the last episode ended where a shrunken All Might is handing a water bottle to Deku felt perfect and satisfying! I also mentioned in my S1 review that the anime played itself as an important set up piece for S2 and I was right on that account though not everything is explored nor answered. Naturally S2 will be a nice setup for S3 which is why, once again I will have very high hopes!",10,PakiUSA

I would give him an ""overall 9"" but the last ep that came out, ""11"", is just too good, it gives you a strong feeling of accomplishment, an eyegasm.

As for the art, its is not the most beautiful art style you'll ever see, but it is very good, i'll rate it 8/10

                So, I started watching this anime alongside the new Attack on Titan because I wanted another show to watch on Saturday mornings, and also to see if it lives up to the hype.
Does it live up to the hype? Hell no. But neither does Attack on Titan.
Is it bad? Hell no. I love waking up early on Saturdays to see the new episode.
This review, along with my score, will be edited throughout the coming weeks, and eventually when season two is completed. For now, here are my thoughts (on both season one and season two).
My Hero Academia, to me, feels very uninspired, uninteresting, and cliche.
                  It's not bad, per se, but it just doesn't bring anything new to the table. It has a school setting, it has superpowers, and it has a tournament arc - stuff that people LOVE. And that's okay. If you love all things shounen, you'll love this series. If you're looking for something more... well, you won't find it here. It's an anime in which you can find all its aspects in other anime. You've got your regular MC who doesn't believe in himself, the cliche love interest, the MC's good friend, his rival who hates him, blah, blah, blah. You've got your superpowers, which have NO boundaries unlike other anime (devil fruits, stands), you've got your regular ole bad guy group (legit called the league of villains).... generally, nothing really feels new in this anime. There isn't one single aspect it completely fails on, but it also doesn't nail anything either. Here are my more specific thoughts:
Story: 6 - I think we can all agree story is not this series' strong suit. It's cliche, very simple, and even misleading at first. It draws you in with a story about a boy who has no superpowers in a world filled with superpowers. You'd think it'd be about him getting along in the world without being special, and gradually building up his confidence but NOPE by like episode 2 he suddenly has superpowers and everything's fine. Then, he trains for a bit and goes to a superhero school.  By the end, there are some bad guys or something, and they fight. They're like ""We'll be back!"" Yeah. That's the entire story of season one. And now, there's some type of fighting tournament going on in season two. That's it.
Art: 9 - Probably some of the best art I've seen, it's unique, quirky, and reminds me of One Piece. (I love One Piece.) The animation is crisp and great. No complaints here.
Sound: 8 - I mean, the sound isn't BAD, per se, it's just not that good either. The voices are okay, but the main character sounds like a weenie hut junior type guy. His voice is pretty annoying, and is compounded by his personality. During fights, the sound effects are pretty good, and that paired with the good animation make an enjoyable experience.
Character: 5 - My biggest gripe. It's also my biggest gripe for the new Attack on Titan. The characters are supposed to be what this anime is all about, but they all feel like narrow-minded, one-dimensional stand-in tropes that are there to fulfill a certain purpose. Izuku is your run-of-the-mill loser protag with a crappy childhood but ends up being ""the chosen one"" type deal. Ochako is there as a cliche love interest introduced early on. Her backstory can be summarized in like 1 or 2 sentences. Iida is just kinda there, I mean he has some quirky personality but that's it. Kacchan is your cliche MC rival that hates the MC, and is hotheaded. All Might is basically superman. And Todoroki is pretty decent, though he has a cliche tragic backstory. For an anime with a big focus on is characters, this is pretty disappointing.
Enjoyment: 8 - When it comes down to it this is all that matters - whether or not you enjoy what you're watching. I enjoy this anime. I enjoyed binging its first season and catching up with its current episode. It's fun to watch, the fights are entertaining, and the interactions between the albeit cardboard characters are pretty funny at times. It all depends on whether or not you can look past the complaints listed above, and well, I sure can.
Overall: 7
If you liked season one you'll 100% like season two. It's basically more of the same.
Again, this review will change with time as more of season 2 comes out.",7,Zeldro

                Warning! I've seen only 6 episodes. i reached the fanservice scene and went to a priest to cleanse my soul.
Story 3:
There is more asspulls than Jojo part 2. Somehow. The tournament arc is bad and unnecesseraly long. Why is there a hero tournament where bussiness students head face to face with Class-A. 
Art 9:
It's good.

The OP is worse than before.
Characters 1:
I really hated Todoroki, Deku, and Uraraka as if I'm being cursed by the Antichrist. Iida has nice character development. Mineta also exists. Bakugo's screaming brings pleasure to my ears.
Enjoyment 2:
The fanservice scene from ep. 6 is the worst fucking thing I've had the displeasure of seeing. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. They are 15 ffs.

                Bones comes back! From 2010 to 2014, their anime didn't have as good quality as they had done. But in Boku no Hero Academia, they say to fan that: ""Sorry for your waiting, we come back!"". Thanks to Nakamura, fight scenes in Boku no Hero Academia are so great. In season 1. we are impressed by the battle between All Might and Noumu and in season 2, all of us can't help seeing the battle between Midoriya vs. Todoroki. I'm sure that, Boku no Hero Academia is anime has the greatest fight scenes in Spring Anime 2017. About story, Bones adapted BHA is as similarto
                  manga as they could. I like its opening, its story, and its character.",9,Zankokuhime
33486,"
                Superheros? And a whole school for them? So that they can be churned out like a production line? Now, I'll say here, that the whole superhero concept never grabbed me in the first place - and I've seen more than a few movies about them, only thanks to insistent relatives. Otherwise, the whole concept of massively OP characters wearing silly costumes and flying around a city, all the while blowing it to bits, would be subject to steer clear of.
It's only thanks to immense boredom that I began the leap into the world that is My Hero Academia. Honestly, after being inflicted by months of
                  trailers, rave reviews and various gifs relating to it all over the internet, let's just say I was curious.
Yes. It starts out beyond cliche of cliche. Yes. For the most part, the story is exactly what one can get away with assuming it will be. However, what one cannot grasp with the trailer, or even the first episode or two, is the sheer size of that cast of well-likable, well-developed characters.
The art is nice, the sound track is spectacular, the pacing is excellent, the action is enthralling, the humour is easy to grasp and what's best, is the fact that it can still be somewhat intellectually stimulating for viewers outside the target audience. Which is something that can't be said for many anime aired nowadays.
Of the vast shounen genre, I predict that one day, My Hero Academia will be a classic. Please reader, even if you're doubtful about how such a premise could be held in such high regard by so many, take the plunge and discover why it's brilliant.",8,troublesomeone

                I tried watching BNHA when it first aired in 2016, I got up to episode 5 and dropped it there because I couldn't deal with Izuku's crying. However recently I got back into it and I'm still not impressed. Not only did it take Izuku nearly the entire first season to stop crying, throughout both seasons he still injures himself after using his power. Even after Aikawa lectured him about control he managed to change nothing at all. He controls it in a few instances and not at all in others, I don't understand. He's had this power for over a year. And it kind
                  of angers me that he has all this power and time to learn how to control it but he doesn't. I also don't get the hype over this show, it your typical school, superpower shonen at heart with flashy designs and characters. Only difference is Izuku is the weakest, wimpiest main character I've ever seen. I'm going to finish it but I don't see it getting any better at 23/38 episodes.",6,couchgod
33486,"
                The first season of MHA was great after about Episode 3. Memorable characters like Iida, Tsu, and Uraraka helped maintain my interest for the remaining 10 episodes. The hallway scene where the entire place is being evacuated for trespassers was one of my favorite scenes in that season. However, 9 episodes into Season 2, and the magic is practically gone. The climax near the end of S1 was so fun to watch. But what happens after a huge incident like that? N O T H I N G. Everybody goes and plays sports. That is just flat out boring. Tournament arcs are some of the
                  most drab, uninspired, and uninteresting things I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. A show I loved dearly, Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V, had like 3 tournament arcs. Arc-V is a very slow-paced show, with almost 150 episodes, and to have tournaments like that taking over (what seemed like) 10 episodes, was so sleep-inducing. But at least those tournament arcs had an impact on the future of the story. The first tournament would determine who would be in the Lancers, and the last determined the ending of the series. One of the few tournaments I don't mind in anime is in Pokemon, since it's a staple of the games (and anime at this point). XYZ's blew previous Pokemon Leagues out of the water and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I cannot say the same for MHA2's tournament arc. In Season 1, the spotlight was on Deku, Uraraka, All Might, Bakugo, and Iida, for the most part. I hope you didn't like that, because that's GONE in Season 2. Now, the spotlight is focused on some kid who has fire and ice powers, who was not important IN THE SLIGHTEST in Season 1. Now he's suddenly more important than Deku? Why? Why is he bigger on the poster than Deku? Why not just put him in the center of the poster at this point? I don't care about him defying his father. We had never heard of his father until this season! This was never brought up in Season 1! We also have a focus on other classes. Why are they just being introduced now? Because it's suddenly important to have more than 4 main characters? This is an anime about children being born with superpowers (the main character being the odd one out in this case, making him even more interesting than other characters) for Christ's sake, and you choose to do a motherfucking SPORTS TOURNAMENT? There are endless possibilities you could have gone with for this story, and you chose the most boring and overdone option. I seriously hope the second story arc makes up for this boring choice. Aside from two intense battles I've seen so far and one touching moment with Uraraka, there has been nothing worth sticking around for for 25 episodes. Hell, I can't remember anything that happens in the first 5 episodes, that's how boring this story is. I could skip the first 1/5 of the season and I would have missed absolutely NOTHING of importance. I've only seen 9 episodes as of this writing, but so far, Season 1 had much more going for it than Season 2. If you're new to this show, skip the first story arc. It's incredibly boring.",6,Coolfizz10
33486,"
                So my biggest issue with is series and the reason I dropped it straight after this season is the writing, which I feel is  pretty bad. First off we have villains, who I never actual felt really did much to be consider that ‘evil’, for instance they only seemed to ever target others with quirks, for instance they repeatadely target the students, why not go for aneasier target, to make them look truly like villains? Additionally a main character that just wants to be a hero, I’m sorry but that is a crap reason and bad motivation, give me a reason to care about
                  him.
Another issue is the lack of character development, of the cast litererally dozens, where there they only  concentrate on a select few, and never bother with the others, instead the writer’s idea of character development is instead just make new characters up with increasingly stupid quirks.
Final issue, and from what I hear it continues in the 3rd season, you talk up a villain, in this case ‘Hero Killer’ (really not, but okay it happens of screen I guess) Stain and then he gets beaten by a bunch of kids pretty much. Okay so MC was one of them so I guess that’s okay......but the whole giving him a nickname, and his first appearance is just hospitalising a characters brother, when they could have gone the more extreme route and just killed him, it would of given the guy more ‘threat’ and opend up, shock horror character development for a guy who is mainly just uptight and shouty. Instead we get a bunch of student heroes in training trying to stop a killer, and like evr other time in the series none of them really suffer any consequences, mainly as they have a doctor that can seemngly heal anything, so where is the tension or drama in that exactly.
And then ‘hero almost kbut not quite killer’....he gets beaten and carted of to ‘villain’ jail, just like happens to the big bad in season 3, so what’s the point really, anyone can see when ever this cash-cow eventually just dies off it will come down to fight 78 bewteen Deku and Bakugo who will be a villain, and then the power of freindship will save the day.",4,nishsin
33486,"
                Season 2 starts off on a high note with the annual sports festival to divert the attention away from the villains that infiltrated the academy in the first season. 
Everyone wants their quirks to be noticed and this season shifts away some of the focus from Deku and gives Todoroki some of the spotlight but also doesn't fail to show Bakugo's explosive personality either. Those moments were GOLD. 
**SPOILERS**
The events were intense and it seemed like Todoroki has stolen the show until Deku puts his brain to use and thrusts himself to victory in the obstacle course.Todoroki and Bakugo see Deku as a an obstacle/
                  rival in a sense so imagine how livid they were when little Deku got first place without even using his quirk!
At the cavalry battle, everyone aimed for his 10million point headband. Needless to say, it was a very nervewracking match for him and his team but somehow he was able to advance. During the 1 on 1 match I thought he would've lost to Kenzo's brainwashing quirk. (never read the manga)
I like where this season is heading and I think I enjoyed it a little bit more than season 1. All the characters are pretty likable and their quirks seemed well thought out and translated well on the screen. The interactions and self monologues that Deku has with himself and his river of tears (which seems to be inherited from his mom) had me laughing continuously... like his crying face... haha..... I kinda wished that would've been his quirk. 
We also got some daddy issues between Todoroki and Endeavour where he didn't want to use his fire half just to spite his father. Gotta see where that one goes.

                Time for another review that no one is gonna read!
(Thanks to that one kind person who had been finding my reviews helpful)
Boku no Hero Academia,another great season,another hit,another awesomeness
1) Story:
The story,just like season one,is about his road to become a hero
I wouldn't say there are no times when you don't get bore or something like that,there exists those.I think at least one episode was boring(in my opinion,most would not find any flaws) so there were some pin holes in the story.But if we talk about overall,the story was fantastic,very good and enjoyable!
8/10
2) Art:
Perfect syncs,perfect reaction,nice coloring and attractive animation.An ideal piece of art for any
                  upcoming anime.
10/10
3) Sound:
I don't think I found any flaws in sound(I should quit making separate spaces for art and sound) and everything went according to studio's plan.But in the episode(s) which I said boring,I think the sound played a role too.
But it great as a whole.
9/10
3) Character Development:
They played slow for this portion,little by little,they introduced us to how the villains' personalities were,heroes' were etc.Which I think is great because the audience get to understand what is going on much better.The way they introduced Hero Killer:Stain was something unique for me.At least I don't think I have seen anything like that in an anime(Don't clearly remember but Bleach might have done it),there win and lose points and stuff,that was an excellent effort.
10/10
4) Enjoyment:
Now this is the important part,because whether you enjoyed the anime or not is a big thing.If an anime has ratings good enough to make your jaws drop,but is not according to your taste,it wouldn't be worth it.What you are looking for in a story,type of action you want to see,the comedy,the romance etc. plays a great role.
For this time,this one has more action,compared to other season and some animes,which is great but also have drawbacks too.
This season is full of action and story(*MINOR SPOILER!!!*except the festival one,since there is no story there except they have to fight there)
But if the story and action,comedy etc are running in parallel,I don't think anyone would hate it
9/10
5) Overall:
This one was definitely a season super hit,not as good as the first season in the start but it slowly catches up to that.The way they ended it was almost as good as season one,but I guess there were boring parts in season one too(not as super boring,like 6/10)
But overall,it was what I usually look in anime so it was a perfect hit for me(with the exception of those episodes) and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who seek enjoyment,hype,excitement and great story.

5 wish grape-kun could just go away
My review of Hero Aca Season 1 made the claim that it was the prime example of what a Shonen story is and that still holds true for season 2. In the case of this second season I would say the only way to describe it is PLUS ULTRA!
The art in the show still relies on minimal CG to the extent that outside of 1 car, some water, and the show logo itself everything seemed to be 2d animation so a round of applause for another well animated season of Hero Aca! *clap*
Complaints
                  I had about the pacing of the first season were almost entirely resolved. The whole season seemed to move much better than before with maybe things being hurried along a bit in the second half of the tournament arc. The season covered 3 separate story arcs with it's 25 episodes and did so with just the right amount of attention as necessary. 
Hero Aca does a great job of providing a world that the viewer wants to know more about. The people, places, and things all raise a lot of questions and while this season brought up a LOT of interesting aspects about the world we are in it still only gave us as much as it felt necessary to keep things going. I liked that. A lot. 
The action this season was superb with my personal favorite of the season being All Might's segments. There are few things I enjoy more than power levels being established in a show by presenting the viewer with a visual rather than a long explanation. 
The character developments were amazing this season as we get to see what drives not just our hero Deku, but just about every supporting character as well.
Hero Aca has learned from it's predecessors. It is filled with typical Shonen plot tropes, but at every turn that trope is either done very well or it is twisted in a different more realistic direction that suites itself to its setting. For example instead of Deku giving a typical ""power of friendship"" speech to someone he hardly knows or doesn't really have a place to consul he keeps to himself and that characters friends/family/other help them to realize where their own hearts lie. 
Overall I will once again proclaim Boku no Hero Academia is the pinnacle of Shonen. It is the best Shonen anime I have ever seen and is truly its final form. Much like ""One for All"" the shows predecessors have all cultivated their craft to be distilled and passed down to Hero Aca. Keep smiling viewers. Why? Because Boku no Hero Season 2 is here and there's more to come!",10,Moomochi
33486,"
                Note: This is a review for all of Boku no Hero Academia. The reason I chose this season to review was because in my opinion, this is overall the weakest entry in the series.
Like several mainstream anime, My Hero Academia has serious problems that are overlooked by the majority of its viewers who are blindsided by its ""creative style"" and ""exciting cast of characters"". 
As a long time reader and watcher of the series, I've grown to be hurt more and more by the unfortunate mediocrity this show likes to consistently stoop to. 
Every time something relatively game changing or hype is in place, it's
                  either used for plot convenience to make the main character look good/become more powerful, or it's outright done horribly.
My Hero Academia bathes in its own mediocrity and excels in nothing aside from your extremely generic shonen fare. There's justifiable reason it has been dubbed ""Naruto 2"" or whatever.
People see something that isn't there. They praise characters that are only used once in a blue moon to push the plot along or to garner unwarranted hype by said characters fans. And even then, easily 90% of the characters are one note tropes, or bland pieces of cardboard cut out to specifically cater to the lowest common denominator. 
It's gravely unfortunate that stellar, unique series such as Dr. Stone or The Promised Neverland are typically sidelined in favor for this 50% abysmal, 50% average at best series.",5,Uggotaku

                INTRODUCTION
Season 2 of MHA was filled with poor writing and new boring characters except stain that didn't leave much of an impression on you. it was a disappointment in many areas and i do personally feel like the writer gave up in some moments throughout the season and did whatever was necessary to move on to the next scene/plot. i found myself constantly sighing throughout the show due to its poor writing and hopefully ill be able to explain my reasoning clearly enough so that you understand my dislike for this season...
TOURNAMENT ARC
The tournament arc was TRASH!!! I'm not even going to get into specifics
                  because there's no need in order to explain my reasoning. the tournament arc was supposed to give the students of UA a chance at showcasing their quirks in different settings so that the pro heroes watching the tournament could invite the students to do internship for them, the big problem is the lack of variety in the tasks they had to do in the tournament. every single thing the students had to do were more suited to students who had powerful quirks or quirks that made you faster than everyone else, there was no variety so that other students who aren't fast and strong could showcase their abilities and because of that they looked like they were crap compared to the stronger and faster students. the fact is that the pro heroes need to see the students in different scenarios so they can pick the right student for their internship, so to fit that they should of had more variety and not just make it about the fast and strong people. i don't know if you know this but in the world of MHA there's not that many quirks that are strong and most of them are only suited to specific tasks. so all I'm saying is that there was no variety. when it came down to the one vs one battles a lot of the fights were rushed in order to get to the more appealing fights which isn't exactly a problem but it would of been nice to see more fights. hardly any of the students in the one vs one fights actually used strategy, there was only one moment in the Uraraka vs Bakugo fight but that ended with guess what... the stronger character won. overall it would of been nice to see some surprises, maybe one of the 3 stronger characters losing to one of the weakest but i just thought the entire tournament arc was poorly executed and i think the writer forgot the whole point to this Sports Festival (Tournament). ill get into some of the others tournament stuff later but overall i thought the tournament arc was TRASH!!! MOVING ON!!!!  
THE TODOROKI PROBLEM
Todoroki in the first season rarely had any speaking lines whereas in this season practically revolves around him which isn't a problem. Todoroki is incredibly overpowered for this MHA world, the reality is that Todoroki could probably win against most villains. you see how OP he is when he goes through each task in the tournament. Todoroki unlike everyone else goes through a character arc which was utter BS, Deku practically begs Todoroki to use his left side to melt the ice particles that are building up which he doesn't want to use because of his dad. the problem is that throughout this arc and the 1st season Todoroki has no problem using his left side to melt ice he created. now that's a issue because in this particular scene I'm wondering ""why don't you use your left side to melt the ice like you've already done before?"" it breaks the illusion of what is supposed to be a intense moment. once Todoroki's character changed he becomes a wet mop and is easily one of the most boring characters in the entire show, every single time he talks he barely has any emotion, its almost sad...
THE STAIN ARC/INTERNSHIPS
This arc is easily good because of stain, he is the only character in the entire show that has a different belief/ideal that anyone else and that makes him interesting and new. if you think about it who out of the students has a different ideal to anyone else in the group, they all want to be the best and have the same outlook for the most part. its the same with the villains, the villains are evil just because, not one of them actually has any interesting ideals or beliefs that drives that character to make certain decisions. its these reasons that make stain interesting, however is he an master piece of a character? no, no hes not but he is interesting unlike everyone else. to be honest the internships were a joke, the only characters to do anything interesting was Deku and Froppy. the problem with that is that the internships is supposed to be a peek for the audience and the students so they have an idea of what a pro heroes life is like, its supposed to be a reality check but you never feel like anything interesting is happening and it almost feels pointless until Stain arrives in the arc. if stain was not in this arc it would of been incredibly boring, i mean Momo and the other girl did photo-shoots with their pro hero, the harden brothers did nothing but manual labour, Uraraka learned a few things but never put it into practice at that time, Lida paroled the streets but again until stain showed up he wasn't doing anything interesting either. it would of been nice to see these students have to deal with real world problems that pro heroes deal with on a daily basis but we don't get that. this whole arc apart from stain is poorly written and again i feel the writer missed an opportunity to open our eyes to the world of MHA.
FINAL ARC
This arc was TERRIBLE. you have to remember that these students just came back from their internships which is where they should of got experience and probably should be a little bit smarter. The main part in this arc i want to talk about is the practical exam because this is where shit got stupid and allow me to give a few examples, Todoroki and Momo are fighting Eraser Head and eraser head ties Todoroki up to a pole so hes hanging there while Momo is supposed to be running away, Todoroki can use fire and ice and yes he doesn't use either to try to get from being tied so he can help Momo. the reason the writer didn't even make Todoroki try is so Momo can have a little bit of character development where she has to learn to think for herself even though we've barely seen that as a problem before. this is an example as i mentioned before where the writer wanted something to happen and in order to make that happen he avoided all logic. another example of this is when earphone jack and Anivoice are fighting voice, during this fight they are getting really loud sound waves blasted at them while there in a forest and voice stands at the exit gate. Now the problem with this scene is that at no point did the students use any strategy for example, MOVE OUT THE WAY OF THE SOUND WAVES!!! this could be done because the teacher doesn't know if he hits them with the sound waves and he doesn't know exactly where they are so it would be easy for them to move. By the way ill just remind you, THEY JUST CAME FROM INTERNSHIPS WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE LEARNED TO BE BE SMARTER. They get out of it by Anivoice making bugs crawl up the teachers leg and he passes out because he was afraid, one problem... He's a PRO HERO and he passes out because of some bugs on his leg, imagine if that was a real situation. The last fight i wanna mention is the fight against thirteen who can suck people towards using her black hole fingers, Uraraka gets sucked towards her and thirteen is shocked and has no plan in place for when someone actually comes towards her and she gets taken down by a little girl!! My biggest problem with this practical exam is how stupid these scenarios are, its as if the writer didn't know how to get them out of a situation and he wanted to do it quickly so he came up with the most stupidest solutions. As i just mentioned these students just came back from internships so how come they fight exactly the same as they were in the FIRST SEASON!! the others fights were OK, the all might fight was meh. I don't like the fact that Bakugo said he'd rather lose than team up with Deku because Bakugo surely still wants to be a hero so surely you'd want to do good in these exams. 
My opinion overall is that this entire season is devoid of strategy, idiot moments where the writer couldn't figure out what to do, introducing a few new characters and doing nothing with them and all that SHIT is topped of with a cherry called stain!! i hope I've explained my reasons for giving this anime a 4/10, its actually funny because originally when i watched this season i didn't think it was so bad and that was partly to do with the fact that i wasn't really watching it properly and then i re watched it and realised how bad it really is....",4,TheKamo94

                [Slight Season 1 and big 2 Spoilers, and Manga Spoilers]
My Hero Academia (or Boku no Hero Academia) was released in 2016. With it being controversial for its crappy and see through concept, but amazing characters, said some people. When the show came out you either love it, or hated it. The fandom around the time of season's 1 ending was a toxic mess, but that's not what we're talking about today. This show got a squeal (multiple), This anime's first season blew anime fans out of their seats and we were all excited to see more seasons coming, with this amazing masterpiece getting a second
                  season, what are my thoughts?
This season sucked
And here's why
Story, 4/10
This season's plot kind of triggered me in a lot of ways, this season starts off with the aftermath of  the ending of season one (The USJ Attack), and then they wiped that out of the way and there-forth came the School Sports Festival. To me all I felt like season 2 was about was to get our characters ready and hype us up for season 3 (which to me I really enjoyed). The sports Festival included some new characters like Shinsou, Tetsutetsu, Kendo, and more. To me all this season felt like was a Chunk of filler, and taking off the training wheel's of some characters for all the serious things they had planned. The Stain arc didn't have much impact on me, but I hate how they keep making new characters then throwing them away completely (Stain, Shinsou, All for One). Yes i'm aware Shinsou comes back in the manga but holy crap does it take 2 seasons to bring back a great character asked by many? in my opinion it shouldn't.
Art, 7/10
Okay but like, we need to appreciate the art this season, the whole Todoroki vs Deku scene really hit me. The art for this fight, and like all of bakugos fight's I felt like were 100% full effort into the making of these scene's, and well drawn. To the Colours, the ideas, the everything, the art was truly something.
Sound, 5/10
What did I feel about the intro...? Meh. This intro is Iconic for its high beat fast sounds and it was spread worldwide fast, the ART for the intro was great, but the song choice felt poor. The sound for the fights though felt pretty good and defiantly something, However season 1's sound for there fights and just the whole season in general felt a lot better to me. F in the chat boys
Characters, 7/10
As I said at the start, this season was to prepare the characters for future seasons. Which this season did well, my problem was that that's all this season really felt to me. The character design's and their voice actors felt amazing to me, and truly great with High effort. Even the dubbed actors, and that's saying something. Having the idea of opening out Todoroki with him getting a high request for more screen time from Season 1, was Defiantly the right move, the whole ""It's your power not his!"", Scene became a meme with the fandom, and is a truly loved scene.
Enjoyment, 4/10
It took my friends and myself age to convince myself to continue the sports festival arc. I really didn't enjoy it and was think of dropping the arc altogether, I stand by my point by all this season did was improve characters with a big sized jar of Filler episodes, that changed the plot in a horrible way. Many ways could've been done to make season 3 better but they way they did it instead made me feel like it was missing a whole lot more, PIZAZ to it (and it was).
Overall, 5/10
This season felt empty and nothing to me, overrated and over-hyped as HELL. I could've spent my time writing a review on why Tokyo ghoul season 2 was the worst thing to come to my eyes, but instead i'm here saying why Season 2 of one of the most popular shounens out here, sucked bakugos thicc butt
There you go folks, my review on season 2",5,HuntersNotFunny
33486,"
                This is by far the best season of Boku no Hero Academia.
What is great:
The characters see so much growth, Deku is much less of a crybaby and the writers actually poke fun at his emotional state which is refreshing.  In the internship arc you finally get to see Deku get a handle on his powers.
The tournament arc is fantastic and goes by quick.  The action is great and you really get a better understanding for the relationships between the heroes and their individual strengths and weaknesses.  It also introduces some fun new characters.  It got me really involved trying to figure
                  out he wold come out on top.
The hero killer is also a great arc.  He is the most interesting villain we get to see and Tenya's quest for revenge strikes to the heart.
Negatives: 
I can't really think of any.  The only reason I can't give it a 10/10 is because I doesn't stretch my thought processes and I don't get a lot of personal growth out of it (other than ""you say run"" playing constantly in my head).",8,Frassati
33486,"
                It seems safe to say that this is what a lot of us have been waiting for since the end of last season. 
Tournament Arc, Intern Arc, this season is here to please. 
The season is coming to an end and it's been a thrill to watch it all thus far. There's been minimal filler episodes, which is something I am very happy about. We see the students develop their powers even more this season, and it's been especially satisfying to watch as Midoriya tries to master one for all. 
The season jumped off to quick start with the introduction of the UA tournament which
                  ran or about half of the season and it was heart racing stuff week to week. The introduction of the rest of the student body was a nice touch. It really went to show that although class A may indeed be the ""best"" of the first years, they are not alone. The fierce competition coming from the other classes was amazing. 
As we got to the actually fighting, the elaboration and extent to all the powers was amazing to watch as well. For those who have been reading the manga, I'm sure they know exactly how everything plays out, but it has nonetheless been pure entertainment watching it all. The animation has exceed my expectation. All the powers pack so much more punch and it feels like even the studio has a better grasp on what it means to be a hero. 
The intern arc was fulfilling as well. Yet another step up in the complexity of the story, introduction of more villains, elaborating on some of the other heroes as well was a nice touch. 
Everything about this anime has grown and surpassed the first season. It is no wonder that is is immensely popular at the moment. It's a juggernaut and for obvious reasons.",9,Eddy_Kruger
33486,"
                Too many irrelevant characters and quite frankly, I only enjoyed the U.A sports and the battle against Stain. The internship was questionable to the point how suddenly Midoriya learned to use his 5% power of One for All in his entire body. The stupid 2v1 student vs teacher test was very pointless and all of the battles were plain boring and uncreative. The last episode was is just a foreshadowing premonition that it was so boring that I speed rush 2x. I honestly can say I am not excited for 3rd season. Nothing against Shounen but these Quirks are just so simplistic for some characters
                  that it feels like a cheap rip-off of One Piece, etc. How does a person with the Quirk, ""invisible"" ever improve in the hero course in high school? There are Quirks that are so unbalanced and there is literally zero character development for 90% of the characters and I just wanted to get this show over because I liked the start but the end is torture. Work hard and train hard. How come that invisible girl stays invisible even with the teacher's ""Erase Quirk""? The laws of this world does not even follow itself. What a joke.",4,barisax

                This one will be short. May contain some spoilers, but I'll try keeping it as clean as possible.
Story 9/10
UA sports festival = The chunin exams from Naruto. In a good way. Lots of character developement (not only main character), introduction of the villains. Deku learns how to control his quirk more efficiently. A lot of crazy stuff going on, but the pacing is doing wonders.
Art 10/10
Outstanding animation and consistent art-style through the whole anime. A pleasure to watch.Sound 10/10
Keeping up the standards from the first season. Awesome opening and ending themes, as well as the background music. 
Character 10/10
If you thought the first season was lacking in terms of character developement, you have plenty of it here. Developement for everyone, even the villains!
Enjoyment 10/10
As you probably figured by now, anything less than a 10/10 would be heresy.

                This anime, Boku no Hero Academia Season 2 definitely deserves to be placed into my top 5 favourite animes. It surpassed my expectations as each fight scene evokes the determination and personality of every character and includes various hilarious moments throughout the season so far. Now, here is a breakdown of my thoughts on this incredible anime:
Story - 10/10
The first season really lacked the action in each fight scene and furthermore, every one of them was quite anticlimactic as we weren't shown Midoriya's true potential. With that being said, the 2nd season completely erased that thought from my head as each fight scene is exhilarating
                  to watch and all u want is more more more. After the Sports Festival Arc, we see Midoriya finally succeeding in controlling his quirk, One For All, and his immense strength is shown in his fight alongside with Todoroki and Lida against the Hero Killer: Stain. This fight scene is probably one of my favourites in this season, therefore the story deserves a 10/10. 
Art - 7/10
The art style in this anime is quite different to the typical anime art style. Although this style is not a style I particularly prefer, this art style fits perfectly with this anime for some reason. Especially in the fight between Midoriya and Todoroki, the art is extremely good and the fight scene is displayed substantially. Although the art is not the best, it doesn't really have much affect when I'm judging an anime: the plot and character development is more important.
Sound - 10/10
This anime probably has the best soundtracks ever and each soundtrack really evokes all the emotions in each scene and just makes you feel motivated (Haha I can't really describe the feeling). My favourite soundtrack in this anime called ""You Say Run"" fits perfectly in almost all fight scenes and it really fits the Hero theme of Boku no Hero Academia.
Character - 10/10
Boku no Hero Academia Season 2 displays each character exceptionally, showing and describing each individual's personality and humour. The character development of Midoriya's childhood friend Bakugo is superb as it really demonstrates Bakugo's determination to be no.1 and his jealousy towards Midoriya, although he seems to be more of an antagonist.
Enjoyment - 10/10
As I mentioned earlier, this anime really makes you laugh through all the funny moments and at some points makes you feel nervous especially during the fight between Hero Killer Stain and the UA Students, so therefore, I realllly enjoy this anime.
Overall - 10/10
Of course, there is no other score I can give this anime than a 10. It's one of my most favourite animes and I definitely recommend you to watch this!",10,rinki7ori
33486,"
                My Hero Academia grew on me quick, after finishing season one I wasted no time in getting right into season 2. This season alone was highly anticipated and it was getting people like myself excited to see what lies ahead for this series. The first season was great but its main flaw was that due to its low episode count it wasn't given enough time to flesh out some of its characters(villains in particular). However I did say that the series had the potential to fix that, was this season an improvement ??***contains MINOR spoilers***
Story:10/10
Much more depth. The themes it discusses are heroism, teamwork, and
                  vengeance. It starts off wit the Sports Festival arc which is a tournament where the students get to showcase their quirks in order to be recruited. What I loved here was that it greatly expanded the series' world by giving us students from other homerooms and during the Final Exams arc we received the whole faculty. The sports festival arc was also used for us to grow attached to the characters by diving deep to their backgrounds and feelings. This was also where the heroes were forced to work together at one point which helped develop relationships, the Hero Killer and Final Exams arcs used this as well. Another huge highlight here was that we were given the orgins of One for All which brought a lot of depth and backstory to not only the story but to All Might as well.
Art:10/10
Just like the first season, Bones delivers again as expected. Such a visual treat wit stellar animation and beautiful action scenes. It's pretty clear that the animators put a lot of effort into this series, animation is so smooth and not once did it feel like it lost consistency. The action is so exciting and its given dynamic shots that captures the weight of its emotional moments. It's just so top notched and feels like its in its own league in this department. The character designs to the new characters were also very interesting and showed off their personalities(Toga). Stain looked mad dope and reminded me of Deathstroke for some reason lol. Another thing that impressed me here were the facial expressions as it added great emphasis to a lot of strong scenes.
Sound:9/10
Great job here. The English dub is great once again so many actors put on great performances here. I was very impressed wit Luci Christian as Ochaco, she gave the character a lot of life. The sound effects did a fine job adding impact and tension as well does the music. The music score was done very well nailing most moments whether if it was comedy, drama, or even plain. As for the OP I thought it was decent but I prefer season one's, imo it was just more hyped and plus I cant really see myself listening to it on my spare time. 
Character:9/10
Development is much better here. We got to know a lot characters better wit insight to their backstories and motives. Even Deku who was under the spotlight most of season one was better here. His growth is depicted very well here as he's establishing his own identity as a hero and making decisions on his own in crucial situations. He gives the series a lot of emotional and memorable moments and its what makes him a great main character. Supporting characters shined here as well like Todoroki, Ochaco, and Iida. Each were given episodes to standout that made them more relevant and were fleshed out well. Bakugo was entertaining again and we were finally given a glimpse from his childhood that explained his attitude, however I feel like we still need a lil more insight. Even Minoru the pervert of the series was given a scene that explained his reason for becoming a hero and although silly, it did make him more relatable. As for the newbies Gran Torino was fun to watch he gave us some hilarious moments, but the standout was Stain. He played a villainous role and what made him so great was that he added complexity to the story. His motives were understanding and clear plus he was very tough and his impact played huge parts in both the heroes and villains. I'm still having troubles wit Shigaraki, although we were given his goal towards the end we still don't know why he wants to do this. As of now he just seems like an immature hot headed guy.
Final Verdict
Pros
+An already great story that's impressively given more depth and backstory
+Characters are given rich development that make their goals and purposes clear
+English dub is spot on, one of the best in recent years and music is very good several songs to choose from
+Hero Killer arc: gives the series a great villain that has a reasonable prophecy
Cons
-The League of Villains still need more work
Personal Favorites
Characters:Asui, Stain, and Bakugo
Arc: Sports Festival
Fight: Deku vs Todoroki
What an outstanding season, I rarely give out tens but I feel like giving this a nine just doesn't show how amazing it was. If anything I'm giving it a ten cuz it feels more like a ten than it does a nine, to be exact it would be a 9.5. The sports festival arc is imo one of the best arcs I've ever seen and episode 23 is one of the best episodes ive seen period. Season 3 will now be my most anticipated work along wit season 2 of One-Punch Man. Beautiful animation, awesome action, improved characterization, and a storyline wit more depth, My Hero Academia is on pace of becoming an all time great.",10,saiyan_og

                It has been a long time since I haven't done a review, so here we go. I will maintain my spoiler low so don't be scared! So let's resume the beginning of the first season before I jump toward the juice of the second season.
Boku no Hero Academia was at a first glance a comedy show for me, seen Deku being bullied a lot by Bakugou, which is a recurrent character throughout the story.
However, it was after each minute that I understood my mistake. What a great mistake I have done. The first meeting between All Might and Izuku made me feel extremely sad for
                  the main character, seeing how his dream was being crushed apart from his favorite star since his childhood. Imagine if your favorite idol, who you have been watching constantly met you alone and said you that your dream of following his ambition his foolish and can't be obtained because you simply lack the power to do so...
I didn't expect that. I didn't expect this show to go dark so early. I didn't expect philosophy of life to go all out. 
But right after the end of the episode, thing keep moving out quickly. I was sad, happy and hype in a single episode that I couldn't saw time flying fast. And at the end of the first episode, I teared up like a crybaby. And the whole season was exactly the same as a start: Permanent cliffhanger, character development, extremely powerful music, a flashy and interesting art along the great enjoyment I still maintained at a high level.
But wait, this is a review for the 2nd season, right ?! Let's things start moving !!!
I finished catching up the season in only 2 NIGHTS! I usually don't do that so that means that I was hooked. Overall i find the second season even more great than the first one, simply because of the fact that all the characters started growing up and the final of the first season made them change their visions quite a lot, because well, they were near death. We saw flaws and others sides of them that we didn't expect, like why Todoroki was that quiet and saw more spotlight of interesting characters like Tokoyami who got an awesome quirk and seem to be a bro personage. We also saw more bad sides of the heroes organization, like Endeavor who is holding the spot of the second world heroes along the title of the first most bastard dad in the world too. In this season, we're seeing villains that are definitely not killing for the sake of the plot but with a proper ideal. I'm looking at you Stain. In order to not spoil you, let's just say that I was surprised again. I first thought that he was a simple psychopath, but his way of talking is way more interesting and righteous than at my first glance.
Story: 8
I could rate it better, but this isn't the story that makes the series that awesome. It's the quality of the flashbacks and talking that make you into it. They don't stand there talking and forget everything right after, no. They don't fight for one minute and then show other things. 
However, many mistakes were made. I mean, how the hell did the school have enough money to create a stadium that his 7x time bigger than a football stadium, organizing a worldwide broadcast tournament where students where shown to be beaten so badly they had to go to the infirmary multiple times, and an invisible girl made it to Izuku class when there must be other overpowered students who applied?
Look, I'm not bashing the whole story of MHA but there is more evidence I could think off. But, they aren't enough to make the whole plot looks bad and there were many epic moment and lessons of life through it which save it. It's like with Star Wars case, this is a like a modern/futuristic/fantasy universe allowing some random things to happen.
Art: 9
The art is really great. They show a lot of details like Bakugou being hurt from the recoiled of a huge explosion he had made in order to make him survived in a fight or some crazy face of Lida and Midoriya when they got fired up but also Stain evil smiled and Shigaraki eyes behind his hands that hide his face and a lot more. But it's also colorful and really fast pace when needed.
Sound: 10
Ok, the sound of the effects mixed with the arts is sublime. It's a perfect fusion between those two that make your jaw fell in a One Piece style. Most of the awesome tracks like ""You say to run"" are not abused which made them still awesome to hear when you're in, it's more than a meme trust me. But honestly, the music was even better than the first season! They could probably put them in a movie in the right place honestly.
Character: 8
Not really that surprising if you watched the first season. The character development is still there and liked I said, you will understand more the ideal more of the side characters and iconic like All Might, Endeavor, Todoroki hiding his second side...
The way they act, the way you see that even caring and a lawful person like Lida can become mentally break because of a huge impact in their hearts show that nobody is safe from hatred. Heck, even Bakugou is seen less as a brute person because we saw more of his intelligence and the fact that he can recognize his opponents and will always fight them at his fullest even if they are weaker then him, which make him respectable despise his tantrum of words.
However, Todoroki father was one of the main reason why I didn't rate this category by 10. Kicking your wife and son for the sake of making the biggest hero? No, I don't think it would be possible and you would be placed in a prison. 
The pervert purple guy is also one of the characters I wish wasn't there. He doesn't have any relevance to the story and removing him wouldn't make anything change, really. I don't know if his main goal is supposed to be funny, but each of his scenes was kind of awkward instead of making me smile. To explain more my opinion about the purple guy case, as for Bakugou case, I didn't like him but I still got it that he was important for the story, making the series more interesting so in a way, I started to like him more and more. 
As for the introduction of two new bad guys at the end, I feel like it wasn't a great choice. Why? Only manga readers know who they are and we don't have any information or clues about them, only that they despite Shigaraki way of thinking and then leave without many talking. I would have preferred this scene to be put at the beginning of the season 3, I know they tried to make a cliffhanger at the end but this part was unnecessary, most importantly thanks to the scene at the mall which already settled it. 
I also liked the filler episode, but not as well as the others. I mean, it was great to expand froggy purpose, but some moments were quite boring.
Enjoyment: 10
Now, that is a tricky question. I need to stay objectives but also to show my own emotions in this review. I can't guarantee you will like the part I'm writing right here.
Did I say how childish I was when I was watching it? The tingles that I got on my back when the music and flashbacks kicked in the right moments? I just can't wait next week, this is hard. I could hardly contain my lips moving on their own when something amazing happens, which is quite regular in BNHA.
And that what is amazing with My hero academia. Despite all the mistakes I could found by myself, I still was fully hype toward each new scenes, waiting for the next episode to come up.
Overall: 10
This is what I was searching for. A story where a lot of characters are not there just for the sake of being shown and we learned more and more about them. I won't really expand this part because you clearly saw with this review that I'm becoming a fanbo... No, a fangirl because I keep feeling my heartbeats going faster and my emotions being fueled again and again along my mouth moving on its own. I LOVE IT <3!",10,Chachalotte

The first season of My Hero Academia was amazing, although it did have some slight issues, so while watching season 2 I hoped that the issues in season 1 would be cleaned up, that is exactly what I got and so much more.
Story (10/10)
The story continues with our students in class 1-A, after surviving a close encounter with villains they now get ready for the school sports festival.
The first half of the season concentrates on the Tournament arc and holy sh*t was it incredibly intense, thrilling and entertaining to watch, despite tournament arcs being used quite often in some anime's, Hero academia just
                  made it an amazing thing as we get to see our aspiring heroes duke it out with each other to gain the top spot and the outcome of the tournament was actually a bit surprising to me.
Even though most of the battles were quick and short, the ones that lasted longer were glorious to watch, seeing the characters trying to outmanoeuvre or out-think their opponent was epic to watch while also being interesting at the same time since each character has their own specific weakness.
The arc ended with a comedic relief episode where class 1-A had to come with superhero names for themselves and for the most part they had some pretty kickass names.
The second half of the season on the students getting their internships so they could learn what being a hero is all about, they also learned to control their powers better too especially Midoriya.
The situation also got a lot darker as the hero killer Stain arrived and the fight between him, Midoriya, Iida and Todoroki was definitely a high point of the season, we got to see our heroes fight amazingly together while Stain kept on saying stuff to throw them off their game which lead to one of the best confrontations so far this season.
After that the final episodes focused on the students fighting against the teachers so they could work out their weaknesses, even though the final episodes don't have the students fighting against villains, fighting against the teachers is definitely a cool swap around mainly because we get to see the teachers in action and the students trying to overcome their powers and experience.
Finally the final episode pretty much ended the season on a huge high note for me, at first I thought it was just going to be a chill episode then when Midoriya was on his own and Tomura showed up sh*t got real, the whole episode left me on edge wanting more. 
Characters (10/10)
The main problem with season 1 was it's screentime between the characters as many of the lesser known characters barely got any, in season 2 that problem has definitely been improved upon I mean each of the 1-A students gets a moment for their character to shine, so the lesser known characters are more memorable by the end of the series.
Midoriya himself had a lot of development too, especially when it came to using his powers because by the end he actually has a good amount of control over his powers , so Midoriya has pretty much become a true badass although he still cry's a lot.
Other than Midoriya a lot of other characters got a decent amount of concentration too, like for example Todoroki who became the second protagonist of the tournament arc mainly due to conflict within his family and how it's affecting him, until Midoriya showed him otherwise and because of this his character was majorly improved.
Iida and Uraraka had some development too, Iida became conflicted during this season because of what happened to his brother, but when he realised his motive was wrong he learned from it and hopefully it would make him a better hero in future seasons, despite Uraraka not having as big a step she had some moments especially during her fight with Bakugou that made her a stronger character this season.
There were some new characters introduced, despite mainly appearing during the tournament arc they still managed to leave a mark for me.
Even the villains managed to improve, well sorta, Tomura was more of a whiny kid this season and it made him unlikable until the final episode where we say his true colours which sent shivers down my spine, then there is Stain who was actually very intimidating and ruthless, he has a goal in mind and he will not stop until it's done.
Art (9/10)
The artstyle continued to impress me, the immense strength and execution of our characters powers was really good along with the aspect that they are getting stronger and more used to their powers too.
I did like the locations of where the series took place, but and this is probably the only setback for this series, is that they were a little bland however the areas where the students trained at the academy looked pretty cool.
Some of the designs for the new characters like Stain and other academy members looked great, Stain definitely fitted the look of a person who goes around killing heroes, although I felt like Mei's equipment during one part of the tournament looked too much like the 3D maneuver gear from Attack on Titan.
Sound (10/10)
The op, ed and soundtrack were amazing in season 1 and season 2 managed to keep up that awesomeness, both op 1 and 2 were really good, they fitted atmosphere of the situation that was going, the ed's were pretty good too, the first showed the female students which seemed right since Uraraka and Tsuyu are the only ones who get some screentime and the second ed was very interesting, it showed what Hero academia could look like in a fantasy setting which I would probably watch so the op and the ed's managed to create another interesting beat.
The soundtrack was also amazing, it used ost's from the first series while also using it's own stuff and possibly the best example is during the fight between Stain, Midoriya, Iida and Todoroki, that was amazing to listen to.
Extras:
The action was fantastic in this season, great fights during the tournament arc especially the ones between Midoriya and Todoroki, Uraraka and Bakugou and Todoroki and Bakugou, each of these fights were hectic and intense to watch because you'd want to support characters yet they could end up losing, mainly due to their opponents power set.
The hero killer arc fight was just as amazing if not the best fight of the season, we see our heroes struggle to bring down a villain who knows how to take on heroes and seeing them defeat him was epic beyond anything.
The comedy in this series was more spaced out compared to season 1, although this season was lot more serious, but there were some moments here and there that left a smile on my face, like for example ep 13 where the heroes were deciding their names and some of those names made me chuckle a bit because of how stupid they sounded.
Enjoyment (10/10)
Overall My Hero Academia S2 is everything a second season should aspire to be, it isn't perfect, but it is damn close to being perfect, it managed to correct the mistakes season 1 had and built even more upon that, because after the finale I am damn excited to see where season 3 will go.",10,Tyrannicswine117

Season 2 of Boku no Hero Academia was a blast to watch. I'll keep this clear, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this season and I'm expecting great things to come in the future.
When I was watching Season 1, my first impressions of the characters were mixed but that changed at the end. The last episode from the first season left me admiring the characters and my views towards them upgraded in Season 2. We got a lot of needed character developments, whether it's extending what the existing characters have or showing off new aspects of characters
                  who we used to not have much knowledge on. Being a hero is a hard journey and these characters shows us viewer how much effort you need to put in to achieve that. They all have their own standards and goals. In the span of 25 episodes, I found myself relating to them a lot. But that's not all we've gotten here. New ideas of justice, conviction, and conflict given from the villains creates depth and meaning in the story. I think these ominous villains have traits that are interesting. It gets you thinking about what obstacles must the heroes face in the inevitable 'Superheroes vs Supervillains' conflict that will eventually come.
A lot of action happened during the first half and I must point out at the animation. It was stunning and full of hype. The camera work, whether it's fast paced or close ups, really goes to show how powerful and intense the battles were. You move with the scene, so it's really immersive. It fits well with the art style, you can't experience it this well in Season 1. When it comes to sound, I like the OPs and EDs, particularly the first one for both of them. They're catchy and regarding the OSTs and voice acting, I can't say much except they captured the mood of the scene perfectly.
I can't wait for what's to come next. Boku no Hero Academia has a great set of characters, both heroes and villains, that will drive the story to its potential. Season 2 has given us many new things and expansion on existing things, such as the theme of 'being a hero'. Being a relatively new Shounen doesn't hide the fact that it's reaching the top of my favorites list, and quickly too.",9,OVERPOWERED99

                As a massive fan of shonen battle-style anime, I adore this show. With that said I'll do my best to review it objectively.
Story: (6) The premise of the show is very interesting. A world where everyone has super powers? Cool. Hero Academy? Also pretty cool. But this season is definitely a bit of a mixed bag. The stereotypical tournament and exam arcs are explored this season. Personally I enjoyed the tournament arc. The obstacle race and the cavalry battle were a nice change from the typical non stop battle format. It was also interesting to see other characters and quirks aside from class 1-A. With
                  that said, the pacing could have been handled better. The exam arc was fine. Nothing really crazy or noteworthy about it. The part of the story that really shines this season is the Stain/internship arc. It explores what life is really like as a pro hero, and questions what a hero truly is in the first place. Overall, I'd say it's pretty good although there are things that could have been handled better. The lack of filler was also nice.
Art & Sound: (8) The art and animation are very well done, especially in comparison to the first season. I found the fight scenes to be particularly well rendered, and the colors are vibrant and appealing. The style isn't overly stylistic and can be a little basic at times, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. They've also done a good job with the voice casting. Even in the dub, the voice actors are well matched and really bring the characters to life.
Characters: (6) Like the story, the cast is a bit of a mixed bag. The main focus is Deku, who is admittedly not my favorite main character. He can be whiny, cries a lot and struggles to adapt at times. But he has good intentions and a good heart. He's also very selfless and wants to help others. Despite his faults and at times annoying behavior, it's hard to genuinely dislike him. Aside from him, most of the main cast (Class 1-A) are very likable. They're good kids who want to make a difference in the world and aren't afraid to take action in the face of danger. A portion of them are a bit undeveloped and flat at the moment, but there's always room to explore them as the series goes on. The exceptions to that likability are Mineta and Bakugo. I dislike Mineta primarily on principle. I'm not a fan of pervert characters and I don't find his antics very funny. Bakugo is another matter altogether that I won't get into.
We don't really see many adult characters aside from Endeavor, All Might, Eraserhead, and Gran Torino. I'm going to be honest here: Endeavor is an asshole. But his existence is interesting in that he's a hero, yet he's not very heroic. At least he's not what many people think a hero should be. Like Stain, his presence brings up the question of what a hero really is. I don't like him but he does serve a purpose. Much like Deku, All Might is flawed. But his noble intentions make him really likeable. He, along with his mentor Gran Torino, also serves as some nice comic relief. Eraserhead reigns everyone in and acts as a much needed voice of reason. I enjoy him as a character. The inclusion of each of them really adds to the show.
Villains aren't really focused on this season. However the one villain that does make an appearance is a good one. Stain is no slouch. He's a tough opponent and has a high body count under his belt. But the best thing about him is the fact that he has motivation. Despite the fact that he was only in a few episodes, he was a well rounded and enjoyable character who had a clear and impactful purpose.
TLDR: It's a fun shonen battle anime with an interesting premise, but the story and character development could be better. It's worth checking out if you're into that particular genre.",7,aries418

                Picking right up from where the first season left off, the 2nd season of My Hero Academia continues to keep up and match with the expectations. We get to have a closer look to characters that had been on the sidelines on season 1, but still having a clear red line with the plot. Characters had some great developments and each of them contributed to the story greatly. While, yes the Sports Festival Arc took about half of the episodes, it didn't feel too much spaced out story. 
I really enjoyed this season and I think it's even better than the first one (mostly because
                  in this season they didn't have to introduce us to the world or the characters that much) and I can't wait to watch season 3! 
If you enjoyed the first season, I highly recommend watching this too.",9,maggiic
33486,"
                Once I finished the first season of Boku no hero academia, I did not feel that I had enough things from the show to call it a very good show. However, it was a potentially long-running shounen. Hence judging it from watching just 13 episodes was always going to be a problem. Although Season 1 built up a generic premise and introduced an uninteresting group of characters, it was never really hard to watch. In fact, all the arcs had a good pacing and did provide minor development for the sure. So Season 2 is pretty easy to watch as well as you know the
                  show should get better after season 1. 
Plot: We have like 3 arcs to watch in this season of 25 episodes. Since shounens like these never provide enough in one episode, having more episodes in a season definitely helps. The show also does enough for the audience to not get bored. We have a sports festival arc consisting of 12 episodes that provide a lot of development for the uninteresting group of characters that were introduced in season 1 and makes them more acceptable for the upcoming episode. The focus on the 2nd arc is basically dragging simple concepts and exaggerating them. We have our typical psychotic antagonist who feels he kills people for just cause and the show will try to pretend that his ideology is actually something to at least think about. This arc has some fine action of course with some very good script writing that we get to see once in a while. The third arc is a less serious final exam arc that sets things up for the next season while doing what the show has managed to do throughout the season and tries to polish some of the concepts we've already introduced too.
Art and Animation: Animation for Boku no hero academia is pretty good. The fight sequences are done well too. This aspect of the show shouldn't be a problem to anyone.
Sound: Soundtrack of this show also does its job. Creating a nice warm tone and also telling the audience the events that are happening is important. They don't overuse it like a lot of shows do and that's one of the reasons it works.
Characters: Finally the biggest improvement of this season is the character development we get. The biggest example is Todoroki who gets plenty of psychological exposure in a nice amount of time. Midoriya keeps discovering certain aspects of his character as well as his fighting style. Iida gets much more development as well proving his character is not one dimensional. We also get to know more about Ochako who is likely to be one of the major plot players in upcoming seasons. The other side characters get a decent amount of time too. Bakugo is still a guy based on one characteristic of course. And I don't even know if they want him to be a better character or not. Perhaps that serves the purpose of the show later on. Therefore, the characters get a major boost this season which certainly plays a key role in the improvement we do see in season 2.
Impact: Other than those technical aspects Boku no Hero Academia keeps things simple. Its problems and solutions are unrealistic and yet people of all age groups can relate to the characteristics required to solve some of those problems. People can see a shell of themselves in the diverse group of characters. Considering the main target audience of the show, this is very important as it can also be helpful towards their growth during early teen days. The concept of what it means to be a hero which is pretty much the main concept of this show can play a big role in creating an anti-bullying mentality for the young generation. So basically this show maintains strong purpose while moving on with its plot elements. 
Conclusion: Boku no Hero Academia isn't perfect yet. But the 2nd season did a remarkable job with visible improvements in most of the fundamental areas.  It gives off a warm feeling, has a good pacing, often relatable basic character  psychology everything makes this show worth watching.",8,Shadmankc

                To start off after watching the second season of Boku No Hero Academia, I can proudly say that this anime has become one of my favorites. This season delved into characters's backstories and their reasons for wanting to become a hero. Although they all wanted the same outcome, the way in which they wished to achieve it was unique to the characters. The characters, the story, the soundtrack, animation were all exceptional. I was blown away at how the characters continue to impress with their resolve of being a hero. We saw each of the stranghts  and weeknesses of the characters through the tournament
                  arc and how the characters then used thier strenghts to fight off against villians. This show is a must watch, it isn't the most talked about anime of this time for no reason.",9,saltyanpan

                The second season of My Hero Academia is amazing in every sense of the word. What is there to say about this masterpiece that has not already been said? It has its flaws, but so does every work of art. The story line is a continuation from the first season from where it left off (and they did a pretty good job of picking it up from there) which in my opinion is an 8/10. The art style is good, I adore the way the fight scenes dont skip out on ANY of the action. 7/10 for the art because it does get slightly duller
                  toward the end of the season. The music is probably the best thing about this season. The opining ""peace sign"" has a god-like 70 million views on YouTube (rightfully so) but thats not the only good song in the sound track. Songs like ""Robo Inferno"" and ""Jet Set Run"" are fantastic at setting the mood for an event. 10/10 for the music. Now for the characters. Everybody's favorite broccoli child Deku who gets more development but the spotlight doesnt just shine on him this time around. Other characters like Todoroki and Iida get a taste of fame. 9/10 for the characters because they honestly are a breath of fresh air when it comes to the super hero topic. All in all I enjoyed the 2nd season of this show.",8,donnyderp

                BnHA Season 2 Review
I’ll try not to put as many spoilers as possible.
My Hero Academia has continued to impress me with its portrayal of characters, and being able to present an amazing continuation from season 1. This anime, being the usual shounen, does almost everything correctly to keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. Generating as much hype as possible.
To all fellow manga readers like myself. I can probably guess the amount of hype you may have had when the adaptation was first announced, more so season 2. The thought of having the most iconic manga chapters being animated made us have something
                  to very much look forward to. I am glad I read this manga, but at the same time, not. This is because I would’ve actually liked to see both seasons blind, and experience this show to the fullest.
To start off, let’s be real for a bit, the story of BnHa is nothing new, we’ve seen this all before. Some guy is weak or powerless and then coincidentally meets strong guy, then gets power and then bam he’s cool and stuff. It’s been done before, but BnHa is one of those series that takes this on a properly executed type of situation. It may be a bit cliche with the story and sometimes how the characters are presented like the usual rival and how they aspire to beat the MC and stuff like that. But like I said, BnHa does it right when it comes to these usual things.
Even if it is your typical shounen like I mentioned before, it is still one of the best anime to execute these factors properly and stay within the shounen genre. The amount of goosebumps I get during some of the moments in this season was too much to count. 
Despite all these things, this still proves to be one of my favourite series. Boku No Hero Academia (Despite all the “cliche” things I’ve said about it) is still up there in my favourites.
BnHA 2 happens after the events of season 1. Things are starting to calm down, while new situations may rise in the future. The students take the next step into what it means to be a hero. While that may sound fun, it requires a lot of vigorous training, as well as some big problems to solve. Our characters will then learn how to deal with it and how to become stronger from it.
Something I love about BnHA is how it keeps our cast of characters in mind, and leaves almost no one out of characterization. Sure some characters might seem one dimensional to others, which I guess is somewhat agreeable to a certain extent. Some characters do feel like they’re there to just be there a fulfill a certain role. But most characters in BnHa go through some sort of growth or some sort of development, take this along with good written characters and execution, it makes up for it.
Another thing I love about this series is the ability to keep me enticed and care for each character in the show, especially the villains. While that may have been a bit lacking in the first season, season 2 comes back and makes up for it for its beautiful character development.
Some main focuses of the anime are in regards to Izuku’s development, and him figuring out the true potential of his inherited One for All. With this, he becomes more reliable and less reliant as well as takes matters in his own hands and taking action to suit what most appropriate for the situation. Whilst of course trying to fix his relationship with Bakugo.
The season kicks off with a great arc: The Sports Festival. As though tournament arcs are indeed common, My Hero Academia keeps the intensity of tournaments in mind, and adds its own twist to make it as entertaining as possible, while keeping the hype at a maximum.
It does a good job of straying from the generic form of a tournament arc, while keeping each skill set of each character in mind and making each match’s result as fair as possible even though some match ups seemed that it shouldn't have been.
Of course the results of the arc made sense. It was an arc full of action, as well as helped some characters go through some MAJOR development, making them 100x more likeable (Although those characters were likeable in the first place anyway)
The thing about this anime is how very simple yet not simple it is, it portrays beauty in the plot presented and the factors that lead to an amazing series like this consists of the elements that most of us would want to see.
I’m sure some of us manga readers were counting each week, a countdown to a specific episode that you know will very much excite anime only’s and excite you because you finally get to see it on screen, fully coloured with an amazing soundtrack and the voice actors that put their passion into each character. 
After all is said and done, more arcs come into play with more ways each character can find their true strength and learn different ways to help society as a true hero. While Izuku clearly shows his strength, we mustn’t forget about the other characters (which I’m really glad wasn't left out as I’ve said before) and their goals for the future. With this, we get a general understanding about the ambitions of the other characters thus being able to feel for them once things don't go a certain way. I will tell you right now that this season is indeed more serious and more violent than the last. It has more emotional segments and more action. Sometimes it may be predictable, but the end result still remains satisfactory for the viewer to take in.
The way they presented their Villains was spot on. Guess what, the villains in this anime, are actually THREATS?! Wow, a villain who does his job. Of course villains being threats aren't that hard to achieve. But i’m at a point where I’ve seen too much villains that are better off being called hero’s then anything else. Maybe I haven’t seen enough anime, but I wasn't able to find villains that proved deadly. But i’m glad this series was able to pull it off. While Shigaraki continues to plot some evil scheme, there is the problem of a certain villain, who is very deadly, and must be stopped at all costs. I recommend watching the anime to figure out who that is, for if you watch the initial introduction, you will probably love him more than knowing who it is prior to watching the series.
There’s no need to talk much about the quality animation that Bones put into this since I have too much praise to give it, but I am beyond grateful to them for taking this adaptation to heart and showing us each manga panel in colour and in animated form. I loved every single episode of this show and it presents a fine, simple story of people who want to get stronger and taking steps forward to becoming the hero they want to be. Of course becoming one is no easy task. Things must happen whether it has a positive impact or negative. There are then challenges along the way to achieve the goal they’ve always wanted, and I love the way these characters deal with it and handle these problems. Although some characters didn't get too much shine, the amount of character development we had for most of the main characters overtakes the lack of some.
The soundtrack was also amazing, presenting emotion and epic music for just the right situations and giving the scenes more impact. Without it, it definitely wouldn't have been as memorable. I loved both OP’s and ED’s for BnHa Season 2. I love the significance behind each opening and what they meant and how each characters are portrayed within the OP. It shows gradually how much development and struggles some characters deal with, along with how they would cope with it and use it to better themselves as a person and hero.
Overall, this season was phenomenal and presented what a hero story should look like. Working hard towards it with a cost of many hardships to come. I’m really glad the adaptation for Boku no Hero Academia was put into the good hands of Bones. Every single panel + some original content was a pleasure to see on my desktop. Thank you Bones, truly. You’ve made the Spring/Summer Season for me.
Here’s to a Season 3",9,ItzToxic
33486,"
                (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
While my parents are my greatest heroes, I wouldn’t be where I am today without a couple of other heroes in my life: my younger brother and my older sister.
My parents taught me how to be a good person and looked out for me as I grew up, but my siblings have been the ones that I could rely on and confide in indefinitely. My brother and I have shared the same interests, played the same games, and supported one another in our endeavors. As for my sister, she has been my role model my
                  whole life, her hard work and her stalwart determination inspiring me to achieve my own dreams.
To me, they’re heroes, too. Heroes in their own way. And, much like its first season, Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season would back me up in this claim once more.
STORY
Boku no Hero gets right back into the series after the conclusion of the craziness at USJ with the terror plot by the League of Villains. Deku, Ochako, Bakugo, Tsu, and the many other students of UA academy have zero chances to rest, however, for they find themselves embroiled in events once again.
Since the first season established the premise, the elements, and the direction of the anime, this second season targets beyond these foundational items. Boku no Hero now turns its attention towards building on its core, empowering it through three distinct arcs that each have a particular goal in mind: the Tournament Arc, the Hero-Killer-Internship Arc, and the Final-Exam Arc.
First up, the classic Tournament Arc requires the entire first half of the season, calling forth the teenagers to duke it out as close friends and worthwhile rivals. Therein, the anime showcases much of what makes the series a blast to begin with. Meaningful duels. Nice comedic segments for a lighthearted feel. An awesome display of the numerous Quirks both on their own and in unison.
This arc also serves a secondary function. Inherently, it forces most (if not all) of its side characters into the spotlight. Again, the first season was typically about the beginning of Deku’s journey, so it makes sense that the story would divvy up its focus by peering into the other people that surround him. What better way to do that than with a set of events designed to get everyone involved?
The second arc, the Hero-Killer-Internship Arc, is arguably the most interesting of the three. The students solidify their hero names, learn the ropes from on-site professionals, and some even square off against a high-profile villain for the first official time. Better yet, this arc places the most emphasis on the underlying plot when it highlights the aftermath of these events.
Normally, and especially with an anime like Boku no Hero, people understand that goodness creates goodness. That’s why All Might exists as the Symbol of Peace: to inspire others in the unending quest for what is right. However, the opposite direction also holds true. Evilness spawns evilness, and Stain’s influence (and by proxy the League of Villains) instill in the baddies a renewed vigor for hate. Forming this important parallel and exploring it in this fashion demonstrates strong writing chops on the show’s part both now and when these two sides ultimately clash.
Lastly, the Final-Exam Arc acts as a culmination of the first and the second seasons combined. It takes what Deku and his friends learned and experienced, applying their knowledge in the faux-villain battles with the professors they have come to know and love.
Where the first arc struts the show’s stuff and the second arc explores its ideas on good versus evil, this arc primes the series for its next iteration. Potential romance subplots surface, vital background information reveals itself, and the conclusion marks a definitive stopping point between the opening portion of this tale across almost forty episodes and what will appear in the seasons to come.
All the while, Boku no Hero improves its weaknesses or at least maintains its strengths. The dramatic sequences no longer encroach on out-of-place or over-the-top territory, Bakugou’s dialogue (while still incessant) now has a realistic foundation, and its vital message about what it means to be a hero doesn’t get lost among the many additions to this story. Combined with the purposeful arcs, the new ideas, and the higher execution overall, this sequel deserves a lot of praise.
ART & ANIMATION
Boku no Hero does not deviate much from the presentation of its previous visuals. That’s both a good thing and a bad thing.
Per usual, the anime doesn’t lose sight of its very nice character designs. Returning cast members sport the same looks and heroic outfits which still express their personalities and their capabilities. Moreover, the new designs rock, too. Stain, the other new villains, Mei the sidekick, and some new heroes each go about wearing their own distinct getups, fitting right alongside the veterans of the series. They’re all so creative and interesting and neat that it’s hard to not appreciate them in some form.
Unfortunately, the artistic direction also once again toes that average line. Lighting and background artistry still remain rather underwhelming throughout the show, but better cinematography and advanced (relative to the first season) fight choreography push back against these woes. Plus, the continued finesses with its expressive reactions and minor details (usually during comedic bits) demonstrate extra care in the visuals.
As for actual animation, Boku no Hero earns those high marks again. Deku, All Might, Todoroki, Iida, and everyone else constantly find themselves duking it out with somebody, and the movement from their different actions, powers, and strategies almost never lets up. Especially for some of its stand-out scenes at key points in their battles.
To be absolutely fair, however, the anime noticeably tries to avoid animation throughout the Tournament Arc. Specifically, it reuses many minutes’ worth of previous content and the same tiresome opening spiel at the beginning of each episode of this twelve-episode span. But, given that the tradeoff is several awesome instances in the animation both then and afterwards, it’s not too much of a price to pay.
On top of the fun RPG motif for the second ED’s visuals, the art and the animation within the show once again earn high marks for the majority of its presentation.
CHARACTERS
In this second season, Boku no Hero follows the logical next step. Where before it mostly focused on setting up its bigger players (e.g., Deku, All Might) it now turns its attention to its supporting cast. Not that the show ignores these three or anything like that, of course. Rather, it now aims to round out the experience by bringing everyone else along for this superpowered ride.
Much of this rounding affects fringe characters such as Mineta. Normally reserved for ecchi, comedic asides, he has his own time to shine when it counts. Or even Anima, who has basically not said a single word for almost forty episodes, likewise receives (however slight) some backstory all his own.
The anime goes a step further with some of its other side characters. Fan-favorite Ochako finally reveals her major motivation for enrolling as a hero, granting her more respect than just the cute girl of the group. Yaoyorozu finds herself conflicted over lowered confidence which then explores a different side to her seemingly perfect self. And Fumikage gives the audience better insight as to the strengths and weaknesses that every hero must contend with personally.
None of the supporting cast thus far explode forth with the strongest writing imaginable. Yet, again, even taking the time to build their foundation in this manner really goes a long way towards making Boku no Hero feel less like a Deku-and-random-people story and more like a Deku-and-friends story. Nowhere does this sentiment become apparent better than with the heavy exploration of two characters this season: Todoroki and Iida.
Todoroki wields flames and ice in a half-and-half manner, and those same emotions erupt within him. Before, his cold, distant behavior painted him as an angsty teenager rather than a troubled person. However, as the anime depicts, that’s certainly not the case. His controlled upbringing, his estrangement with his own mother, and his fierce determination force (or perhaps doesn’t force) his hand.
As for Iida, he has always been the straight-laced character, taking up the mantle as class representative and championing the righteous path. It makes his fall from grace of sorts this season that much more powerful. Having looked up to his older brother his entire life, he struggles upholding the ideals that have shaped him as a person as he succumbs to a vengeance that no hero would deem acceptable.
Thankfully, they have Deku nearby. Yes, it’s nice to finally see him make noticeable strides in commanding the ultimate Quirk (for his previous attempts, while important, were quite miniscule). But his greatest contribution has always been how he puts himself out there for his dear companions, and that does not stop in this season either.
In Todoroki’s case, Deku pushes the limits on his own body to their extreme to get this troubled guy to realize that he isn’t a product of genetic mutation but instead his very own self. In Iida’s case, he, alongside Todoroki, boost that heroic passion within him, standing as the very examples of the tenets he lost sight of momentarily.
Taking everyone in the cast together, they also happen to expand on Boku no Hero’s original theme. The first season asked the question, “What is a hero?” Within this second season, it gets more specific when it now asks the questions, “What is a hero to them?”
Ignoring apparent danger to save another person or fighting for a peaceful world certainly make these characters heroes. Yet, they are not all the same. Some wish to give their parents a better lifestyle. Some wish to prove their worth. Some wish to be the best. Some wish to put a smile on their face. No matter the circumstances, these characters have their goals, their hardships, and their characterizations that guide their own takes on what it truly means to be a hero. Progression on this theme demonstrates maturity in the writing and therefore a stronger direction for the anime overall.
Not everything goes smoothly for the characters this season. Shigaraki, the main villain of the series, is still not a very interesting adversary despite his importance within the story. Learning about All Might’s counterpart and that guy’s involvement in these proceedings, however, introduces an interesting twist that will benefit the evil side in the long run (just not any time soon).
Bakugou also receives the short end of the stick this season. His small improvements in the first season counted as big milestones for him as a person, but, over these twenty-five episodes, he doesn’t budge much from his charged, arrogant attitude. Granted, he wouldn’t be Bakugou if he didn’t yell about being number one all the time, but it seems as if Boku no Hero wastes many of its chances on him to start turning over a new leaf in favor of keeping as close to his status quo as possible.
One could also, maybe harp on the anime for forgetting about specific characters after their arrival. Hitoshi, the mind-controlling boy, and Grandtorino, Deku’s mentor during his internship, are the two names that come to mind who basically disappear after they do what they need to. But that would be overly nitpicky. The anime already does a very nice job of providing its non-main characters the attention they deserve, and it expands on its main theme in a notable manner. Two traits which bolster the series to a greater degree.
MUSIC & SOUND
Much like the visuals, Boku no Hero’s musical choices and audio direction carry over from its first season and into this second season. The voice-acting performances persist in their range, emotion, and strength. The different sound effects for the different abilities induce variety and intrigue. And the original soundtrack relies most on its triumphant, heroic tracks when otherwise it presents an okay set of songs.
The biggest change, of course, comes from the opening tracks and the ending tracks. In terms of execution, they’re unfortunately a small downgrade. However, they still bring the fun and the hype that the anime thrives on.
“Peace Sign”, the first OP, meanders along with competent guitar strings, a simple drum beat, and some clapping in the background, yet the nice vocal work keeps the track from falling behind. The second OP “Sora ni Utaeba” stands as the stronger of the two. The infrequent female singer contrasts with the passionate male vocalist with her peaceful delivery, and the piano keys throughout infuse melody into the piece itself.
The EDs are roughly the same. The first ED “Dakara, Hitori Janai” takes on a slightly more whimsical feel with its daintier instrumentation, multiple vocalists, calmer pace, and optimistic tone. And that last lyrical triplet before the piece concludes cannot be denied its catchiness. As for the second ED, titled “Datte Atashi no Hero.”, it ends up as the weakest of the four tracks, lagging in its song structure and general creativity.
Despite these OP-and-ED combos not living up to the first season’s, a couple of the individual tracks still have their own quality aspects. Furthermore, the VA performances, the sound-effects, and the OST make up for whatever small misgivings they may incur.
ENJOYMENT
I must admit, the show has proved me wrong.
In my review of the first season, I wrote how the supporting cast weren’t the most interesting, that “I simply don’t see them as characters that I will be remembering once the series inevitably concludes.” After watching this season, I need take back some of my words.
I have always liked Ochako and Tsu, and that sentiment hasn’t changed, for the former’s kindness and the latter’s honesty usually gets me smiling. Yet a lot of the other cast members have started to win me over. Yaoyorozu is a cute, sincere girl who worries about her friends and holds a lot of pride. Iida is a respectable dude for his unending sense of justice. Todoroki is an interesting fella who now feels like one of the team. Mina is ecstatic, and Fumikage is a cool guy. Even Mei, the sidekick inventor extraordinaire, had me smiling at her passion and her love for her “babies.”
Returning favorite All Might is a blast to watch as well as he goes (mostly) all out during the last arc of the season. Moreover, the Mickey Mouse president finally reveals his genius-esque Quirk (while also going slightly insane as he gets caught up in the moment). I was also happy to see Deku stop maiming himself constantly, and the budding, romantic feelings Ochako shares for him got me as giddy as giddy could be.
Not to mention Midnight’s sexiness, the running joke between the granite-and-metal duo Kirishima and Tetsutetsu, and the crazy action scenes that occur with almost every single episode. To be fair, I now find Bakugou more annoying than ever (which I didn’t think was possible), and I cannot say that I have been swept up by the fervor that surrounds this anime quite yet.
Even so, color me impressed.
Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season flies a tad farther than its predecessor. Worthwhile continuations to the narrative, continued success in its audiovisual direction, larger exploration of the supporting cast, and even more entertaining traits form a sequel whose popularity clearly does not go unwarranted. Indeed, the show is a heroic sibling all its own.
SUMMARY
Story: Great, this second season carries the torch forward, bringing back the cool elements, expanding on the hero-versus-villain motif, and following through on what has and what has yet to come
Art & Animation: Good, while the core artistry still feels underwhelming, the creative designs, the awesome fight scenes, and the smaller details keep the presentation in high spirits
Characters: Good, Todoroki, Iida, and many other side characters earn a ton of focus to round out the experience, they investigate what a hero means to them, but Shigaraki and Bakugou feel like wasted opportunities at this point in time
Music & Sound: Good, the OPs and the EDs are a minimal downgrade from the first season, but the strong VA performances, the intriguing sound-effects, and the okay OST return without fault
Enjoyment: Good, it’s nice to be proven wrong now and again
Final Score: 8/10",8,BanjoTheBear

                It's an above average season. Each arc of this season had its good moments, mostly with the main characters and a few of the supporting characters. It still had some bland scenes. 
The sportsfest arc was it its best on the one-on-one battles. Other than that, it was boring, and at worst weird for me. I hate Bakugo by his very essence, but his fight with Ochaco was something I appreciate. His seriousness may be the only thing that's worth mentioning about him. Todoroki's moments are one of the bests in this season. I can't really find flaws in his character, there may be some
                  but what makes him a good character still prevails. He may come off at first as an angsty character, this is justified by his motivations and the choices he has made. I really like how he is resolving his issues. He changes, in a gradual manner, which is something realistic. I feel like Deku is still the same person he was by the end of the first season. He's grown in power and in confidence, but he still has a long way to go.
For Iida, I don't feel strongly for him. I feel like he has been given the chance for growth but he may be overshadowed by those around him. That's not bad at all, everyone has their own pace. Momo shows potential with her strategies. She's potentially strong with her quirk as well. She's relatable enough being the character that's portrayed as book-smart having trouble with practicality. The other characters are just there. They're average, and I feel mostly bored during their battles. I'd also like to mention how I hate Mineta. He's just there for unfunny comic relief. He's the same with Bakugo, their motivations and their actions are both shitty that put others in harm. I hate that this prevailing perverted acts are still being normalized (is this how it is in Japan?). It just puts off the theme of the series about heroism when we've got characters who are unreasonably violent who think their harassment can just be brushed off because that's who they are. Imagine how it feels like for victims of sexual harassment and abuse to see these characters are normalized. They're worse than the generic villains that have been introduced so far. 
Anyway, I'm watching the series to see the growth of Deku, Ochaco, Todoroki, and Iida. As well as to see the extent of their battles.",6,rotanrotan1

                At UA Academy, not even a violent attack can disrupt their most prestigious event: the school sports festival. Renowned across Japan, this festival is an opportunity for aspiring heroes to showcase their abilities, both to the public and potential recruiters.
However, the path to glory is never easy, especially for Izuku Midoriya—whose quirk possesses great raw power but is also cripplingly inefficient. Pitted against his talented classmates, such as the fire and ice wielding Shouto Todoroki, Izuku must utilize his sharp wits and master his surroundings to achieve victory and prove to the world his worth.
The second season of the My Hero Academia anime series was
                  produced by Bones and directed by Kenji Nagasaki. Like the first season, it adapts Kōhei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia manga from the rest of the third volume through the end of the eighth volume over 25 episodes, and follows the adventures of Izuku Midoriya.
The season originally ran from April 1 to September 30, 2017 on ytv in Japan,[1] and Toho released the season on DVD and Blu-Ray in eight compilations, each containing two to four episodes, between July 19, 2017, and February 14, 2018. Funimation licensed the season for an English-language release in North America and released it in two compilations on April 3 and June 5, 2018. Eventually, their adaptation ran from August 11, 2018 to February 24, 2019 on Adult Swim's Toonami block.[2]
The second season makes use of four pieces of theme music: two opening themes and two ending themes. The first opening theme, used for the first thirteen episodes, is ""Peace Sign"" (ピースサイン) performed by Kenshi Yonezu and the first ending theme is ""Dakara, Hitori ja nai"" (だから、ひとりじゃない lit. Therefore, I am not Alone), performed by Little Glee Monster.[3] For the rest of the season, the second opening theme is ""Sora ni Utaeba"" (空に歌えば lit. If I Sing to the Sky) performed by amazarashi[4] and the ending theme is ""Datte Atashi no Hero"" (だってアタシのヒーロー lit. Still My Hero) by LiSA.[5]",10,Honghan1995

                Why I love Boku No Hero Academia:
The quality and the art is amazing.
The soundtrack is absolutely outstanding and breathtaking.
The character development is one of a kind and both amazing and interesting to watch/read.
The voice actors are not amateurs, plus they really know how to make it feel like you're in the story.The anime characters are all hot, pretty, and unique.
The story not only has the elements of comedy, drama, and action, but the script was amazing.
And I rarely say this but the dub is also pretty good too.
Overall I really enjoyed this anime and can't wait till the next season comes out!
To all those who are new I really recommend you to watch it if you love superhero and action",10,MeNeverland29

                For anyone who hasn't picked up My Hero Academia yet, then get on it. Obviously season 2 is a continuation of season 1, and the show keeps getting better. What makes this show enjoyable are the characters and uplifting story. Long story short, the main character was born without powers; however, he runs into his personal favorite All Might who eventually helps him out to become a super hero. 
Furthermore, for him to become a hero he has to go a prestigious hero academy where he meets other future heroes and rivals. That is the basic premise, but the strength is the main and supporting
                  characters. So far not one character introduced has felt weak, or is there to simply occupy space. Over the course of 20 episodes you start seeing side characters get air time and development. This show has a lot of potential, and finally it's a fun show. You'll get into the fights, and every week you want to see where things head next.",9,panderson1988

                I didn't see this one coming...
Boku no Hero Academia - - 2nd Season! An anime about childhood dreams, heroes, and guts; lots of em. See, the first season for me was pretty good. I was impressed with the basis but felt that there was a lack of development in many departments...that all changes here - - and I probably won't be the last to say this, either. Boku no Hero Academia 2 has thoroughly exceeded my expectations by miles. From the great character development; in almost all characters. To the pure enjoyment that was already great in the first season; this show has done well.
                  But what really happens?
A lot, too much to talk about. It stems right from the end of the first season where we see Midoriya drafting to improve his quirk that was given to him. As well as the school's sports festival, which is basically to see where all of the students are when using their quirks against the odds; as well as many more encounters with villains. It's a big season.
So the art and sound in the first season, for me, were pretty good. It didn't seem like there were any drastic improvements, but with how much more we got; it'd say it's worth the score. Both OP's are pretty great, too (yes, I said both).
With many moments that had me seriously concerned with what might happen next, to the inspiring courage that Midoriya has, it's a wild ride. I would highly recommend you give this season a watch if you were already invested in the first. But be weary, this anime has many ""tropes"" that you'd see a lot. I personally don't mind, but you might. All in all though, it's outstanding!",9,PixlReality

                Obviously, anyone who hasn’t seen the first season is going to be pretty stuck here, so I’d suggest you go and see it if you want to fully enjoy what’s going on this season.
Even though this is a second season, it really feels more just like another few arcs in the series. Great arcs, at that. If you liked the first season, it is pretty much a given that you’ll like this one. The same loveable cast (with the addition of a few new characters), similar antics that mainly take place in relation to the school – in the first half, there’s a school tournament,
                  and in the second there are apprenticeships and exams. It takes place almost immediately after the ending of the first season as well, which helps avoid confusion with timeskips.
There is a nice amount of character development, especially for characters like Iida and Todoroki, but pretty much everyone gets their turn in the spotlight, which is refreshing and even turns a few of the filler episodes into some of the best episodes in the show.
Sound is good, and the opening and ending themes are awesome, especially the first opening and second ending (which really could be a spin-off series in its own right).
The animation is almost the same as the first season, if anything slightly better.
And, just like the first season, it is somehow ridiculously enjoyable for a story that’s been done so many times before. The quirks are mostly original and exciting, the comedy can elicit a few chuckles even during the more serious parts, and just watching Deku and Bakugo’s determination can make a person feel more motivated about their own life! This is an anime that really draws in the viewer and makes them care about the characters; once the tournament started I even found myself rooting for characters I’d barely cared about before. 😊
All in all, a really great anime to watch if you like well-done shounens, action and superpower-genre anime with good character development and a likeable story.

                This Anime could be the saviour for the shounen anime to come for the anime in the future.I really hope this Anime would be influential by writer, producer and anime fan to come.It ignored from the path the same way how most shounen structured, giving more realistic depth and preventing the character from going to exaggerated power escalation.The power ceiling is clear and the character show action with clear goals with so much similarity on how they impact the story but with a different reason for why the character do it at the same time.The character is not an overpowered character and has distinctive flaws
                  that makes the show interesting and thrilling knowing and embedding the character with very much depth by making the main character Midoriya Izuku a vigorous,realistic and appropriate challenge,while accompanied by other similar supporting character who's in the same equal firepower field as Midoriya and fighting for the same goal,Being the number one hero especially for Bakugo.The plot armour is there but clearly proven to be a challenge for Midoriya to rise from the top.This anime should be the next influential shounen anime for the years anime to come.",10,Laktin

I gave the story a 9 because the whole sports festival was very entertaining. We got to see the different characters and what they are really made of.

Tl:dr
Really good development
If you weren't fond of first season give this season a try
Despite the lack of character development in the previous season, this season of Boku no Hero Academia has truly been outstanding. This time around the story was truly based on the characters and what it truly means to be a hero. 
This genre of anime is similar to the genre of sports, when there is any battle/competition the outcome is very predictable.
However the execution for this season provided a connection with the characters that made this series more enjoyable.
Story: 9
Unlike most people I did enjoy Boku no Hero from the beginning, all of season 1 was quite enjoyable for me. The story felt simple yet inspiring, following a young boy who wanted to become a hero. This season focusing mostly on the question of what is really takes to become a hero. The first season had good foundation and second 2 blossomed with it. Focusing on one character at a time provided a more indepth point of view of the story.
Art: 9
The art style and quality is consistent. Nothing super special about the art style.
Sound: 7
Sound matched the atmosphere well however wasn't captivating or any thing special.
Character: 10
I have absolutely fallen in love with the characters the overall development this season has been astounding. Each character got more screen time to themselves where it truly showcased the journey, the hardships, and the epiphanies, and gave more reason to the motives that they have.

                This is how a great story should look like.
In the second season boku no hero academia catched me and made me to a big fan.
10/10 Story. The story is so simpel, beautiful and suprising that you think could this three things ever be in a good constellation? And the answer is: Yes, it makes a great job to conact this three things. We started were the first season ended and it makes a better job than the first season already did. Its about a guy who become the greates hero in history, but it is not that simpel. 
Every good side has a dark side.
                  So its a story about good vs. evil. Thats what you will think first. But its like I said: Not that simpel. In the first season I didnt like the villains and I was suprised in the second season with Stain a mostly understandable villain. Stain took the villians in boku no hero academia to the next level. So the story follows simple rules but it is so mutch more than words can say.
9/10 Art. The art is perfect for the feeling and boku no hero academia, but its not a 10 because my personal feeling likes a other kind of art. 
Sound 9/10 I liked it. The openings and endings are perfect and the theme is mostly perfect.
10/10 Characters. I would give boku no hero acacdemia at this points hundreds of points if i could. I never saw a series that do better with the characters. If we would only look on the characters I would say its the greates series of all time. 
Its like midoriya said this season to his friend""If this was a manga he would be the protagonist"", and he is so god damit right with that. Mostly every character in boku no hero academia could be the protagonist because his background story and his live goals are so incredible strong that they even deserver their own Manga/Anime. Its like One Piece with the monster trio. There are three persons who could be the strongest hero of all time every of theme have great storys and great goals. And its also one of the few Manga/Anime with finally understandable female characters and not big boobs + no brains + no goals -female shit characters like mostly in every anime... I could never express in words how good the characters in boku no hero academia is.
10/10 Enjoyment. Every Saturday I am watching it dosent matter if I travel, being in a hotel... boku no hero academia filled my brain every saturday with enjoyment.
10/10 Overall. Boku no hero academia looks like its the next big thing after One Piece, Bleach, Naruto... And I can say: It is! It really is the next big thing in the anime/manga-world. I will watched no matter how long it will take to end. Only death is stopping me from do that.
So if you didnt watched the first season yet or the second go ahead and watch both. The chance that you will like it is high!

                So for season 1, my biggest quality was that it was a flawlessy executed anime, with great animation, great sound, very enjoyable characters and fights, amazingly well made moments, and all around it was a tremendous expression of what made a good shounen good.
However it lacked depth even for a shounen, it was too mastered and not daring enough, never trying anything new, and it suffered from being a generally dare-nothing anime that needed to just go and try to reach a new height.
Nothing has changed in the second season in this regard, but I want to amend a thing or two:
- The arc with
                  Hero Killer actually was the first time Academia attempted to do a character with motivations and reasons, and thus an ideology. Even if it was a lost bullet, since he had an ideology but fought characters that didn't have one, it was a good sign and I hope this comes around again.
- While the characters haven't grown one bit with this season, there is a clear indication that Academia will not take it easy with character development. If this development could lead to actual depth of the characters, that'd be great, but it seems we're not at that point yet(if we'll ever be).
- Lastly I think season 2 managed to cement everything I said about season 1, it's perfectly mastered, in sound, animation, characterisation, everything, but it generally will not go into depth or setting its characters into any kind of serious ideology, which is a necessary basis for an ideological fight, which is always as important as the actual physical fight, if not more important.
To give room for comparison, I wanna take the most famous battle from this season, the Todoroki VS Deku battle, and compare it to its Naruto equivalent, the Neji vs Naruto fight.
I still consider Neji VS Naruto to be the most accomplished battle in all of Naruto itself, in every way. It was an ideological battle that succeeded in giving an excellent buildup, followed by a strong fight itself, which culminated in a piece of creative genius and gave a perfect physical support to the ideologies both characters had. 
On Naruto's side, the main ideology is that your destiny isn't written and that even losers can reach the top. On Neji's side, your destiny is written already and there is nothing you can do but grind your teeth and take it.
When Naruto struggles in front of Neji and summons the Demon Fox' chakra, it's a visual equivalent to the idea that Naruto's power(destiny) had set him to lose against the super ior power(destiny) of Neji. Neji's given, natural, ""destined"" power is stronger than Naruto's, who gets his power sealed and is thus defeated. However, the Demon Fox' well of chakra pours out and imbues Naruto with a tremendous new force that Neji can't deal with. It's a visual metaphor for the power given to you as ""destined"", aka both fighters' natural chakra, and the power that is truly within you and that you can pull forth if you try hard enough at it, and that this power will help you overcome any adversity. Naruto beating Neji with the Demon Fox' power in the physical fight is also a perfect metaphor for one fighting his fate and overcoming a superior power because of his will to revolt.
Now compare this with Deku vs Todoroki.
Of course there's ideology involved, Todoroki's. He thinks rejecting his father also means rejecting the part of him that inherited his father's power. So when Deku says ""it's your power, isn't it?!"" you have a growth on Todoroki's side, he grows as a character because he realises his ideology was wrong.
However on Deku's side, what ideology transpired here?
Why did Deku say this?
Did he think that powers are their users' property and not their family for some reason? No...
Did he somehow get strong feelings or an idea of whom powers belong to? No...
He said it...because it was common sense. Todoroki's power is his own, not his dad's.
And thats all fine and dandy, but that's the end of it. There is no ideological battle. No physical mirroring and simplification of two opposite ideologies. 
It's a kid who thinks wrong and a kid who corrects him.
Boku no Hero is, and I'm afraid might remain for a long time, maybe forever, the shounen anime that lacks depth. I'm fine with generic and well done, I really am, and honestly, having seen a ton of generic, swallowable but tasteless crap put out by the anime industry, I have to say, I'm really glad Academia isn't as mediocre or boring as it could get, and it still has its own taste and style even if it's generic. But it will suffer as long as it doesn't cross the Rubicon and just give its characters actual deep-seated motivations and ideologies. They're all so shallow, all the fights are enjoyable but have no real meaning, no powerful impact, it's just fun fights with nothing behind, and the plot's still at almost 0, except maybe at the end they imply something's finally going to happen.
Very much how Konosuba lacked character development and depth, My Hero Academia lacks depth and giving real meanings to its characters. If it can manage that, I think it can be a really great shounen.
I'm still giving it a 9 because no other shounen has managed to be even close to this enjoyable in years, but I think you need a lot more than that in the depth department. If this is done, I think I can enjoy this till the end.",9,KingHarkinian

It's enjoyable, BUT this second season is not as good as the first one. The rythm starts being stretched a bit too much for no good reasons and some parts are litterally bad with ugly character design (some could be from Dragon Quest except we are in 2017!).
As long as you don't have any bad guys involved and you focus on the school only, it's pretty cool. The diversity of characters/abilities and how they interact with each other is nice. As soon as you have the bad guys, you start rolling your eyes. You've seen it a billion time already. It's boring.
Again, it's a
                  total Naruto rip-off - sorry, I meant *cough* homage *cough*. Thankfully, the story rips-off the cool period before it turned out messy. You already have bad signs of a stupid intricate Uchiwa plot yet to be extensively explained.
Also you wonder how the story will keep up with all the subplots thrown here and there.
Anyway, I'll keep on watching because it still works ;)",7,wolf_robot

Season 2 really started to pick up for me with the addition of new heroes AND villains. I really liked how each character got a big spotlight to shine in this season and fleshed out each and every characters from Class 1-A and even the big ones from other classes, such as 1-B, General Studies and more! It added new villains too, among which is, in my opinion, the best villain writing since The Joker in The Dark Knight. The action and fights are superb and visually some of the most stellar looking fights I've ever seen, some of the most hype and suspenseful moments in anime I've seen thus far. I really enjoyed season 2 and I loved it so much I immediately started watching season 3. The latter half of season 2 had me on the edge of my seat so much I had to watch ""just one more to find out what was going to happen"" and that kept repeating. Great anime, This will become one of the greats someday.",10,lukethiel

                Definitely better than season 1. The sports festival arc is really good and learning more about All Might's origin story is also interesting.
As for characters, again, I just don't like Midoriya. Don't think he's a good MC. There's just nothing about him that draws me in. And being so awful at using his own power just makes it even worse. Can't fight at all without TKO'ing himself every time.
Much prefer Mineta, Bokugo, Eraser Head, Todoroki, All Might, Froppy, Ochaco, and Momo.
I generally don't care about the ""art"" in anime unless it's just awful, and MHA's art is fine. The music is alright, but not memorable

                This review as it is written is the same as my review (Halo-of-Flame) on Crunchyroll.
TL:DR Watch this for the story even if you do not like the genre. The tale is a wonderful blend of action and the coming of age for a group of students.
Toradora, was the first five star anime that I wrote a review for on Crunchyroll. The weaving of the narrative, the risks it took, along with the gut punching emotions and the willingness to allow other secondary characters to shine became the standard bearer that I compare other romance-slice of life-comedies to.
My Hero Academia is going to do the same
                  in different ways in this genre of Anime.
The tale sound simplistic enough: Its about the journey of a young man to become the best hero of his time. In that journey he has trials, friends, rivals and enemies that he picks up along the way.
But, after watching it, I realized that its the examination of the journey and not the end point. It goes into the mechanics of the how's and why's not just of the main characters, but the secondary and one off characters. The world feels exactly how it is supposed to and not just limited by the school settings. Watching the main character and secondary characters interact with one another and the world at large with their own individual and relatively complex backstories makes them realistic and it immerses the watcher into the story itself, never attempting to wink at the camera or go over the top.
Everything happens for a reason, and keep a careful eye as you watch for the first time the subtle parts of the story. There is an ebb and flow to the story arcs and with a few missteps work seamlessly and builds from one to another while giving the audience a chance to breath in the process.
Every character in the main character's class is memorable, I may not remember their names but if you showed me a picture I can tell you three scenes that they heavily contributed to the plot of an episode or the series as a whole (that's 20 characters). The students all have goals and lives outside of the classroom, that are for the most part explained. Each one is unique in their own right from the way they talk to the way they walk and have a story to tell. While the main focus is on the protagonist every relationship happens organically and with a reason.
The Teachers are adults! This left me thunderstruck once I realized it. They have their own quirky and sometimes goofy personalities, but they have the best interests in the instruction and the *safety* of the students. There are rules and laws that the students must abide by to be safe and have real consequences; and everyone of them are practical and necessary for the society that they live.
Actions in this story have consequences, and not all of them are pleasant. There are heartwarming triumph and heartbreaking failures; and both sometimes happen at the same time. There is the complexity of unnecessary guilt, fatal flaws and choices that should have been better thought through (by students and adults alike), and none of this gets hand-waved away. Instances that have no right answers occur and they have lasting effects forces characters to change physically and mentally.
The art is detailed mixing western style and Japanese animation together and it is quality work that helps to immerse you into the world. People walk differently from one another in the background and everything looks alive, with a few exceptions panning from scene to scene.
The music especially the third op is very symbolic of the journey itself and I only found the third ending song to be found wanting and that was more of the setting of the symbolism.
All in all a very satisfying and enjoyable show.",9,Ifferts_Flame

                Boku no Hero Academia is a Bones anime based off of a manga by Horikoshi Kouhei. So, this is from the same studio as Heroman, Kekkai Sensen & Mob Psycho 100, to name a few. Their works vary in quality quite substantially, so let's see where this one falls. Now, I will be covering the first two series together. So, keep that in mind and understand that there may be some spoilers for series one. Let's kick hero month off with a look at those.
Story:
Our narrative is set in a world where the vast majority of people have super powers, or quirks. This has caused the
                  world to shift and super heroes to become an actual thing paid for by the government. Midoriya Izuku wants to be a hero but there's one problem. He has no quirk. In spite of that, he still wants to try. He just needs to witness the brutal murder of his parents, inherit billions and spend some time training in martial arts and detective work before commissioning a bunch of gadgets. 
Since that origin is already taken, what actually happens is that he encounters All Might, the greatest hero on Earth. All Might becomes impressed by him after an encounter with a villain and he tells Midoriya that he can be a hero. He just has to inherit All Might's quirk. From there, Midoriya manages to enrol in the highly competitive hero course at UA High School and gets to know his classmates while trying to learn how to use his new found quirk without hurting himself. To make things worse, his class seems to attract villains a lot. 
My only real gripe with the series, narratively, is that they spend a bit too much time on exposition. Every time they have an event, whether it's the sports festival, intern-ship or their exam, they spend a bunch of time explaining how it works and why it is the way it is instead of just showing us the event in action and letting us draw our own conclusions. It might not be so bad if the explanation was fairly brief, but some of them go on for quite a while so we can see our various characters reacting to it. We don't need the exposition for the world building to work. This time could've been spent showing the characters interact with their families or just spending time with each other. You know, develop those interactions and relationships more strongly. But no, we get exposition. 
I will say, the narrative progression is strong and I appreciate that the students aren't shown as being ""just amazing"" and ready for anything. They struggle and they need their teachers to come to their rescue. They're shown as having promise, but needing time and effort to refine it. I also appreciate that the series doesn't put Midoriya on an absurd pedestal just because he's the protagonist. He fails, quite a bit. He needs help. He loses out against other students who are more skilled. The series also does a good job of balancing serious situations, like encountering actual villains, with more ordinary situations that don't have hefty stakes but still matter. The world building is really good too. The flashbacks are worth mentioning because this series uses them really well. They aren't overdone. They're positioned nicely and there's a variety of different ones to get the point across instead of the lazy thing where they hammer you with the same couple flashbacks over and over again. I also appreciate the aesthetic. It's like a really good super hero comic, like the ones they wrote back in the 80s before most things had to be dark and stupid. It's been dark times for comics since the Frank Miller law passed. 
Characters:
There are a lot of aspects to the characters I appreciate. The dynamics among them are pretty strong. We get a pretty good sense of what the major characters' families are like. Which is a nice touch. Every single character in the class gets their moments to shine. Naturally, that is more true for the major characters but I do like that it's not exclusively true for them. The antagonists do have some reasoning behind their actions, albeit twisted reasoning. Stain is a great example since they actually go into detail on his. I also like the way they subvert expectations with some of them. Like Shinsou wanting to be a just hero but with his design and ability that would normally scream villain. 
The big negative thing I can say about the characters is that there are a few minor characters who don't really have much to them. Aoyama, Kouda, Mineta, Satou, Hagakure and Shouji are the big examples. Which is kind of to be expected when a series is trying to juggle an entire class. And most of them are fair enough. Except Mineta. He's basically like Carrot from Bakuretsu Hunters, a crazed, obnoxious pervert. The only thing that makes him slightly more tolerable is that, unlike Carrot, there aren't any female characters stupid enough to be romantically interested in him. Watch, now that I've said that I'll find out that changes in the third or fourth series. 
Art:
The artwork looks really nice. The character designs are varied, interesting and just really creative. The costuming is really reminiscent of comics. There's a variety, some bright and popping while others are darker and more plain but they still stand out as a contrast to the vast majority of the costumes we see. Which is nice to see given how many adaptations of those do away with the bright, colourful, good costumes in favour of ones that are drab, and boring. I'll give Horikoshi credit, he knew where to take his costuming inspiration from. 
The action sequences are great and there's a real sense of impact when someone gets a heavy hit in. It's also interesting to see how different characters use their quirks. It's clear a lot of thought went into that. 
Sound:
There are too many strong performances to go into each and every one of them. I'll just name a few of the most prominent good ones. We have Miyake Kenta as All Might, Yamashita Daiki as Midoriya, Okamoto Nobuhiko as Bakugo, Sakura Ayane as Uraraka, Yuuki Aoi as Tsuyu, Inoue Marina as Yaoyorozu, Kaji Yuki as Todoroki & Ishikawa Kaito as Iida.
I could go through the vast majority of the cast and whoever I listed would have a strong performance. The only real exception is Hirohashi Ryou who chews the scenery so much that you'd think it was made of chocolate. It's not her fault. She's a capable actress and has been very strong in several anime I've heard her in. She just has the misfortune of voicing a character who has a lot of heavily exaggerated lines. Have I mentioned that Mineta is awful? 
Ho-yay:
The closest we have in the first two series is Ashido & Jirou both commenting on how cute Yaoyorozu is. It's fine, the three of them can form a sapphic hero agency. 
Areas of Improvement:
Subtract Mineta. I'd seriously just lose the little perv altogether. Give his screen time to the other, better characters. Like literally anyone.
Less exposition, more substance. I'd cut back on the amount of time dedicated to explaining points, let them stand on their own a bit more and use that time to show the students just interacting with each other or their families a bit more. Maybe pump up that ho-yay factor. Then again those of you who know my writing know there's no ""maybe"" about that.
Explore All Might's Decision more. Here's the thing, All Might's decision to pass his quirk to Midoriya makes sense, but it also feels a little rushed. So, I'd probably have the villain event that causes it be the catalyst and have All Might test Midoriya in another way before revealing the truth about his quirk and offering it to him. I think it would make that whole sequence a bit stronger. 
Final Thoughts:
All in all, the first two series of Boku no Hero Academia are great. Yeah, I have a few issues with them but they're relatively minor and don't affect enjoyment all that much. If you're a fan of stories involving super powers, I can heartily recommend it. In the end, I'll give it an enthusiastic 8/10. ",8,ktulu007

                Boku no hero Academia: 2nd season is a great follow up to an already great first season. This season really captivated the potential the anime had; from charater development to animation, every detail of season 1 was put on overdrive for season 2. Considering the amout of time between season 1 and 2, the animation, story and hype felt even stronger and here's why...
Plot (spoiler alert):
The plot was much more fast paced in a very entertaining way, each week I had the same thought, ""I can't wait till next week!"" Not all animes give you that feeling EVERY week. From the UA sport festival to
                  work experience and follow up aftermath from the anger of the league of villains, prior to the anger from their failure at the end of season 1. The plot is always twisting and turning and taking unconventional routes, which added to the overall anticipation of waiting for every new episode. Overall, it is well structured and leaves a lot of anticipation in it's wake. (including hype for the next season)
Character development:
This is probably the most tapped into potential, if you were a fan of Todoroki Shoto, then you are in for a pleasant surprise. It reveals his sorch mark on his face, his backstory and how he can move forward. This season really connects you to him deeper than before.Next best CD is Ochaco Uraraka. You learn about her home situation more and what her goal is to be a hero, which maybe surprising, but what's more amazing about Uraraka's development is we see her struggle and come to terms with how she can better herself, which is surprising and uplifting. Studio Bones do a really good but almost un-notacable job on a lot of the characters. However staying on Uraraka, throught the series ever one has a smartphone and she is the only person with a cheap flip-phone, the subtle details are what really make character development great. I can't wait to see her buy her first smartphone.
Lastly, Stain, I don't want to say too much about Stain however he is a very likeable character despite his role in the anime, his words are very convincing and terrifying, which can flip the series on the head for many viewers.
Animation:
The animation is some of the best in all and recent anime history, you can really tell just by watching how much care and effort Studio Bones put into their animation and it really paid off. 10/10.
Conclusion:
This season really tapped into the potential the Boku no hero series had and without a doubt has ensured many concurrent fans for future seasons, especially with how fast we are getting fed with this series. One of the best new up and coming anime that HAS stapled itself into anime history.",9,ygParris

                Really awesome season 2 I enjoyed the events at U.A, shotos character shined and I loved what they did with stain and building up League of villains, interactions between Izuku and All might were great and the amount of storytelling they did. My favorite moment has to be bakugo and izuku against All might and stain for the short time he did appear did great and made an impact that I'm sure will last till the end of the series, it just keeps getting better and better can't wait to watch Season 3 and learn more about All for one.

                Boku no hero is an amazing show that above all else is unique because of the sense of compassion that radiates off the MC and his close friends as they attend their classes at U.A. I love the strong sense of moral righteousness that is present and is upheld by the students and staff at U.A but it is also questioned by characters in the show at the same time. I really can relate with the MC's selfless attitude and this is the main reason why I love the show, also I have been rooting for the MC and hoping he overcomes adversity so that
                  he can become the greatest hero ever.
The first season was great and got the ball rolling and the final arc really showed how the show can shine with its action and emotions it bestows on the audience. The second season took that formula from the last arc and repeated it in the three arcs present in this second season and boy was it a fun ride.
If you liked boku no hero 1st season then this season is a must watch, it only gets better from the 1st season. If you like the idea of selflessly protecting the innocent and being a guardian against evil things then the boku no hero series is right for you.",9,FrostyHippo

                A very typical shounen anime. I am not addressing originality, as this is not something required for the genre. As such, there are certain tropes it needs to deliver like the whiny insecure protagonist, the Goody Two-Shoes girl, and the explosive shouting sidekick and they are all available in the series. The animation is quite good (without the totally deformed silhouettes we are used to seeing lately) and the voice actors are doing a great job.
Unfortunately, during the second season, the series becomes more and more fragmented and the characters more and more confusing and shallow. Some are given more screen time, some less for
                  no particular reason; there is no real structure so the entire storyline crumbles. 
The lead character is, unfortunately, quite weak while his sidekick Bakugou becomes more and more comic and less and less likeable. The trouble for both is that they have not evolved at all within 24 episodes. It is like watching season one with slight changes and a tad more details. An example is how Midoriya seems to have discovered his resolve and the secret to his powers about 10 times and how Bakugou displays the same aggression and lack of hero morals even after a few teachers and pro heroes have expressed their concerns. There is also the classification of Todoraki as a ""main"" character when he is getting less background story and less screen time than Asui, for example. Yes, I agree it is difficult to tell 10 or 12 stories, but then again - why try instead of focusing on one main storyline and a few lead characters you can fully build and develop?
The lack of development and clear idea or message in the series pretty much makes the ""great rivalry"" in the show ridiculous. Appears like Todokari, Bakugou and Midoriya are all confused by who motivates who, who challenges who and why. It is hard to take seriously or be interested in a three-way rivalry where people often lose motivation and focus.
All in all, it is a good pastime shounen anime but overall a hot mess with no real purpose or idea.",6,UnfortunateEvent

                Nothing much to say. A massive upgrade from the first season.
The story was a cliche after another cliche but it wasn't frustratingly annoying and i could find myself enjoying it most of the time.
Midoriya character suffered an incredible downgrade. I might be going crazy but i could swear that his voice was changing from episode to episode, also his lines were most of the time meaningless or simply boring. He is the main character, i as an spectator should be rooting the most for him but compared to everyone else he just felt the less fun to watch by a long shot.
Finally i was able
                  to see female characters that could offer more than tits or poor fanservice!
Female characters from other classes and some from Class A were actually pleasing to watch! (yeah even Midnight because her character was believable at the very least).
Sadly Urarako and Yaoyorozu episodes were just... really bad.
Urarako episode made absolutely no sense and was completely unconceivable even by anime standards, Yaoyorozu episode where she was supposedly focused into regaining her confidence after falling behind her classmates was full of fanservice... There are scenes in which her breasts are on the middle of the screen... why!?
Invisible girl is kinda doing nothing but she was boring as hell the few times she did anything.
Now after rooting in first season for Iida, Bakugo and Mineta i was completely pleased to see them shining in their own ways once again.
I have mixed feelings about Todoroki since most of his character development was pushed by 5 words from Midoriya and my IQ is not high enough to deduce why those words were holding any value at all.
Shinso in less than 10 minutes was able to outshine a lot of the characters from this season. I loved it.
It might look like im criticizing the anime a lot but i can swear that i really had a good time watching the show this time. 
Shigaraki stole the show in the last episodes, his character is simply perfect. From his attitude to his voice actor, definitely the best moments of this S2 were his scenes.
The only thing that truly irked me was Toga. The villains were probably the only part from this show that i couldnt find a flaw to criticize (a good hero show needs good villains so i was really fond of them). And that's why i was so annoyed when Toga was added.
She is pure fanservice, she is also edgy and one dimensional (a lot of characters on this show are one dimensional as well but some are written properly and are interesting to watch, a one dimensional character isnt always a bad thing but in this case it truly was).
If you can overlook some fanservice here and there coupled with a boring MC then you should definitely watch this season (why am i even saying something like this? Is not like everyone else has already seen this show sigh).",8,CordobezEverdeen

                Boku no Hero Academia is a little bit like your typical shounen but more bearable. Sure, it's a bit predictable, the formula is a little bit old (fighting scene cut to intense and somewhat predictable back stories then go back to fighting), there's plenty of plot holes, but it's an anime that's easy and simple to watch. There doesn't need to be too much thinking, it's generally pretty wholesome. It's not bad but it's not great, etc. etc.
The characters are developed more thoroughly than what can be said for a lot of shounens. The main characters are, of course, given a little more importance than
                  the side characters but it's not to say that the side characters are completely ignored either. Rather, some are given unimportant backstories that are merely there for the dramatic flashback moment of fighting, rather than a well-developed character progression sort of thing. There is a sense of 'is this character too overpowered?' that is muted by fighting that seems to be equal in both sides but it's not enough to turn one away.
The story is pretty standard. There is nothing that you could call original but it's the case with almost all animes. We're merely watching the character development of a young person but that's not to say it's not enjoyable. The show provides a sense of amusement throughout the episodes and can be particularly comedic at times (with the help of side characters that exist solely to be funny) but is mostly just wholesome. You're watching a young boy do his best to achieve his dreams, no matter how impossible it seems.
There is nothing else I'd call noticeable in the anime. The soundtrack doesn't particularly stand out but they don't stand out in a bad way at least. The art is great but it's not something that you'd call memorable either.
Overall, it's a good show to watch when you're in the mood for something easy and wholesome.",7,danielhowell

                WARNING: SPOILERS
After seeing the first season of this I could safely say I had high hopes for the continuation of the series to be good, and I wasn't let down. Sure, it might follow some stereotypes like a tournament, but I don't particularly mind these unless done poorly. The tournament arc provided a good way to introduce other characters attending the school that weren't considered the best of the best or suited for being crime fighting heroes. Characters like Uraraka, Todoroki, and Iida benefited from this the most. The scenes in this season were extremely powerful and were very emotional as well. Another thing I
                  like a lot about this series are the openings. When the openings change they feature the few characters who will be the most prevalent in the coming episodes. What's more is that the heroes encounter a villain who makes society question it's morals and rally more villains in a fanboy squad all while the students get mentored by other pros.
Favorite Character: Shoto Todoroki
It's very hard for me to choose a favorite character in this series, I really like a lot of them. However Todoroki would have to be my favorite in this season. He has such determination not to become the thing he hates the most, but in doing so he is taught that it doesn't make him his full self. He is extremely intelligent and has a good handle on his powerful quirk making him one of the strongest the series has to offer.

This is without a doubt the ONLY season of MHA that stood out from the rest. Not only did this one have relatively fast pacing, but also a lot of character screentime and content.
Starting with being introduced more and more into the world of MHA, you also get to know the school system and also realistic aspects of the hero world. How much their appearance and image will be important in the future and how hero politics works. In the sports festival, the strengths, weaknesses, and motivations of many characters are taken and put into very entertaining fights and games. 
At
                  the same time, the second half gets a bit darker and is again about the Villains League and an assassin who targets hypocritical heroes. This again provides a relatively interesting and critical approach to ""how true heroes"" are defined.  Is it right to call yourself a hero but at the same time demand wealth and fame for your deeds? Or is a hero really just a self-sacrificing symbol, which is only meant to warm people's hearts instead of enriching oneself? 
Despite everything, I personally agree with the villain philosophy on this point, as their definition of a ""true hero"" is the correct one.
The further seasons of MHA will have the same concept. The first/second half of the season will be about the story and the other half will be just about school events and various actions. Unfortunately, the later school events are far more sluggish and uncreative than the sports festival from season 2. Likewise, the pacing suffers tremendously later on and MHA turns into ""Flashback Naruto Academia"" over time. 
[Music 7 & Animation 8]
Musically, I found the first intro more appealing, but this one also possessed its own charm. The Osts remained impressive and very motivating. 
The animations varied from above average to explosively dynamic. Not to mention the Stain fight and Midoriya and Todoroki clash.
[Conclusion 6]
This season has everything an upcoming shounen must-have. A decent training arc that was well involved in the story. Character motivation merged with dynamics and interesting fights. As well as a following serious plot about villains and hero philosophy. 
Unfortunately, this is by far the BEST My Hero Academia season, which disappointed me a bit, because I really like MHA. For me personally, it's one of the best shounen out there. Unfortunately, the quality often speaks against it.

                ""What does it take to be a hero?""...or on the flipside ""How can you make a villain a villain?""
Before LA starts this review LA needs to quote something back in LA's Boku no Hero Academia first season review
""HOWEVER, with Boku no Hero Academia getting a second season, LA wishes that the second season expands more on the world of superheroes and give some of Izuku's classmates some limelight (not an entire episode focus or anything but give the more interesting characters from this huge character roster some time in the limelight) as well as Izuku's growth into being a great superhero"" 
WISH GRANTED.
Boku no Hero
                  Academia 2nd Season pretty much fulfills  what LA thought was lacking alot from the first season and to explain all this LA thinks to go by a plot by plot basis as to why Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season has improved.
******* Some slight Spoilers*******
The sports festival arc focuses on many of the characters from the first season as well as showing that Izuku can be powerful but in the sense of brains over brawn to overcome his opponents, the the later tournament section of the sports festival, Izuku not only tries to control his One for All abilities but also having the face off against Todoroki in which he too get massive amount of character development in the form of Endeavor and his mother in the process (aka. family issues that directly links why Todoroki doesn't use his flame side) and most probably the battle of Izuku vs. Todoroki was the best fight in the second season to boot. The sports festival also brought some characters to the limelight, from Tsuyu, Tenya, Uraraka, Fumikage and Momo, some through getting to know their abilities a bit better (Tsuyu, Tenya and Fumikage are examples) to why the want to be heroes in the first place (see Uraraka for an odd yet noble reason) to finally testing characters powers and showing that they have weaknesses like anyone else have (Uraraka and Momo by the end of it). The sports festival arc gave a bit on world development just for the sake of it's a national broadcast and the such and we meet new heroes like Nemuri ""Midnight"" Kayama voiced by Akeno Watanabe who are scouting for new talent and the such. If not, this arc is definitely more character focused than world building focused though by the later All Might tells the story of One for All to Izuku, a villain who is essentially the Bigger Boss of the series which is a bonus to shaping up the villains who are in question.
The Stain incident or ""the Hosu incident"". Izuku next goes into an internship with Grantorino  voiced by Kenichi Ogata a retired hero who knows about All Might as well as that Izuku having One for All and yes, that's right training arc! Izuku essentially learns how to hone his One for All abilities so he doesn't burn out like he did in the sports festival let alone the first season however things turns extremely ugly for Tenya as he has a run-in and VENDETTA against Stain voiced by Go Inoue, the hero killer and let's just say that Stain is unlike any previous villains Boke no Hero Academia has brought to the table...Stain changes EVERYTHING. Yes the fight against Stain, with Tenya, Todoroki and Izuku is amazing and much more darker especially with Tenya losing it and forgetting about what it is to be a hero, a character who deeply seated in following justice, having wanting revenge fuel him instead, this brings out a utter amount of character development for him and this is only the start of it. Stain himself is just terrifying villain, not just from his abilities but his ideology of a just world is literally infectious to anyone thinking like he does and IT SPREADS, Stain if oddly enough is an anti-villain of the sorts but a villain still doing bad things on his own as he thinks it's HELPING the world, especially from the hero-fueled nonchalant world it has turned into because of All Might, because of Stain, the happy cheery nature of Boku no Hero Academia has changed for the worse. 
Finally, the last arc of the Final Exams got back to character-focused plots, as in bringing in the minor cast to the forefront of a couple of episodes where they needed to face off with the Heroes in order for them to pass their practical exams. There are TWO standout battles in this arc and that is focusing on Todoroki & Momo vs. Aizawa and Izuku & Bakgou vs. All Might. Todoroki & Momo vs. Aizawa gave Momo fans something and brought back Momo's weakness and self-deprecation from the sports festival into full view during this fight and LA quite enjoyed seeing Momo overcome her self-deprecation, Todoroki did get some more character development through his personality as well which worked with Momo by all accounts as Todoroki always thought his plans would work out due to how powerful he is, instead of listening to others. Izuku & Bakgou vs. All Might. on the other hand was ALL about Izuku and Bakugou's already strained friendship which got even worse during the sports festival and All Might being All Might got these to plan things together by the end of it however at least making us see Bakugou's superiority-inferiority complex come out. 
The finale however showed that the League of Villains are mobilizing and increasing in numbers, add to the fact of another encounter Tomura Shigaraki with Izuku in showing that once again Stain changes everything by in the ways of giving Tomura a motive, a conviction to rally the League of Villains into the third season.
What LA took from Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season was not only about ""what it takes to be a hero"", but also as a villain?...We see MANY times of how heroes are shown in this second season, from Tenya's fall into straight up vengeful retribution and forgetting why he wants to become a hero to Todoroki's family ties that suppressing his true powers to become an even better hero to Izuku always wanting to help someone even when he can't save them. But on the flipside showing that villains have their sides too mainly Tomura's beliefs of villany to Stain's. Tomura just wanting to torment and destroy All Might and that's it to Stain's outmost pure belief and conviction of getting rid of heroes in order for the world to be ""normal"" again which can never happen and with the Hosu incident inciting massive appeal to other hidden villains to come out and cause more mayhem under the name of the League of Villains (don't ask) shows the dynamic Stain had not only with the heroes but also the villains.
Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season's animation done once again by Studio Bones was expected quality from them, from the fluid and amazingly detailed battles to the quirky and distinct character designs for the majority of the cast and with the help of certain arcs giving minor character screentime, it helped immensely to know the characters more even with a huge of a cast as Boku no Hero Academia. The animation also gets darker feeding into the atmosphere it got in the Stain incident arc as well as the final episode showing that Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season isn't playing around anymore let alone gonna take the heroes-in-training lightly. The impressive animation from over-exaggerated shounen aura's are back and better than ever and even in the more comedic bits, the animation pulled it off. Bones did it again!
The voice acting is amazing as always but LA might as well pick Ayane Sakura as Uraraka again as she just fit into that character so well as well as her more comedic moments were well timed and executed. However LA will point out other great VA's such as Kouki Uchiyama, Go Inoue, Kaito Ishikawa, Kenta Miyake, Nobuhiko Okamoto, Daiki Yamashita, Yuki Kaji, Aoi Yuuki (seriously LA is still amazed that's Tsuyu!), Tetsu Inada, Marina Inoue, Ryou Hirohashi and Hiroyuki Yoshino for their respective character roles. Seriously amazing voice cast! 
Has LA's favorite character changed from this season?...LA would have to say no, it's still Uraraka, however LA's like of Momo definitely paid off with this season and LA only grew to like her even more now!
Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season is nothing but showing that it had improved on it's first season from developing is core cast as well as villains that ties into their ""what is it to be a hero as well as villains?"", giving even the minor character screentime they needed to standout from the crowd instead of another bystander, world building for both showing the hero side of things from the internships and technically the Final Exams arc to the villains side like Stain's influence, the lore of One for All as well as the League of Villains solidifying their motives. LA can't wait what the third season has in store and by the looks of things, it's going to look grim.",9,LegendAqua

                My Hero Academia isn't my first anime or even my favorite anime, but it is what made me fall in love with anime.  This was my first experience with a straight shounen anime, so I wasn't quite as used to all of the tropes when I watched the first season, so everything felt pretty fresh to me.  After watching more anime and different videos online, I now know MHA is pretty trope-heavy.  It makes up for this, however, by refining these tropes, boiling them down to their most basic elements and fine-tuning all of them.  MHA shows the strength of tropes
                  in storytelling in a way many shows fail to.  And Season 2 only continues to excel, passing Season 1 in its storytelling, animation, and character development. 
Story
Two words: TOURNAMENT ARC!!! Season 2 opens with a bang, delivering an action-packed and emotional arc that highlighted the beautiful animation and gave some much-needed development to some of the side characters.  More on that later.  After the Tournament Arc, we move to the Hero Killer Arc, where we get the best villain in this show so fair: Stain.  The ideology he offers and the way he tests our heroes, especially in the Battle at Hosu, is nothing short of amazing.  The pace slows down a bit with the Final Exams Arc, but it still has some great action set pieces and a sprinkling of character development.
Art
The art really improves from Season 1, becoming much more vivid, expressive, and dynamic.  Season 1 had a lot of static images, while Season 2 adds flourish to almost everything that the characters say or do, often with hilarious or chilling results.
Sound
Not much to say here, except that I love both of the OPs this season (though my favorite will always be Peace Sign in terms of pure musical quality).
Character
This is where Season 2 improves the most from Season 1, which focused almost exclusively on Izuku and All Might.  While Season 1 sets up the world and the main conflict for our heroes, Season 2 begins to explore the different arcs these characters are going and will go through.  Todoroki, Tenya, Ochako, Momo, Baukugo, Su, and even Mineta become more rounded, fleshed-out characters this season, and they deliver some of the most emotional moments this season.
Enjoyment
I loved this show from the very beginning.  From the superhero setting to the relatability of the main character to the potential of this world, I immediately became invested.  Season 2 made good on that investment with moments that made me laugh, cry, and cheer audibly at the screen.  It is a wild and enjoyable ride watching this show.
Overall
My Hero Academia Season 2 builds on the foundation of its previous season and gives us an even more dynamic, fleshed-out, and exciting look at this bright and bombastic world of teens training to be the world's greatest heroes.  It might not do everything perfectly, but it does everything well, and even improves on the flaws of Season 1.  That's all I ask of a show, and it delivered. I can't wait for Season 3!",9,The-Lost-Jedi

                (This is the second part of a series of video and written reviews called The Decline of My Hero Academy)
(SPOILER WARNING FOR HUNTER X HUNTER, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, AND NARUTO + SHIPPUDEN)
Season 2 starts off strong, with the best arc in the anime, the Sports Festival. Admittedly, a lot of why I like it is because it reminds me of my favorite arc from Naruto, the chuunin exams. Regardless, the Sports Festival is honestly pretty great. Tons of action and drama, a tournament of 1 on 1 fights, and most importantly: no villains around to distract Horikoshi.
Let's quickly run through the first 2 stages so we
                  can get to the part I like:
Stage 1: Obstacle race
The first stage is pretty good, but the least interesting stage overall. Deku, Todoroki and Bakugo dominate this stage, settings things up for the cavalry battle.
Stage 2: Cavalry battle
Groups of 4 fight each other in weird formations. Need to grab other participants’ headbands to get points and pass. The higher you placed in the obstacle course, the more points you’re worth in this stage, meaning the bigger target you are to the other students. Deku finished #1 so he’s worth 1 million. This stage is also pretty good, except for the stupid part where some of the students retire from the festival because their memories of it are gone.
But where it really gets good is stage 3: the 1 on 1 tournament. This was the best part of Naruto, and I think its obvious Horikoshi took heavy inspiration from Naruto for this arc. In fact, some of the fights are basically copied from Naruto:
Like how Kirishima vs Tetsutetsu ends in a draw after both contestants knock each other out with punches to the face, aka the same way Sakura vs Ino ends.
And Bakugo vs Ururaka is basically Neji vs Hinata. Aka: female side character that's interested in the main character romantically tries to fight off arguably the strongest student, is inspired by the main character and fights on and on even when they're overwhelmed, and they end up collapsing.
I think this part of MHA outshines the rest of the show for a number of reasons, but the main reason is because it’s the most focused Horikoshi has been through the entire first 4 seasons of the show. Without poorly written villains running around to distract him, Horikoshi is able to focus not only on the strengths of what he’s created (characters, drama, setting), but also the strengths of the battle shounen genre itself.
You have characters informing the action, like Todoroki using his fire powers against Deku, and losing because he refused to use them against Bakugo.
The world building is informing the action, like Mei using her fight against Iida as an advertisement for her inventions.
The action is informing the character development, like Yoarouzu despairing because she lost so easily. Which becomes a plotline going forward.
It all comes together at once to create easily the best arc of the show, and also leads to the best fight of the show: Deku vs Todoroki.
If I had to compare it to another fight, I'd say this is MHA's Rock Lee vs Gaara. Deku's ability is actually pretty similar to Rock Lee's, where using their ability damages their body and overusing it could prevent them from fighting again. And Todoroki has always struck me as MHA's Gaara, what with his overwhelmingly strong ability, seemingly invincible defense, and how both characters hold back their full strength in every fight thus far, never being pushed enough to use it.
Which is what makes the 2 fights exhilarating. For the first time, you see someone actually get to them.
In both fights, the challenger (Rock Lee and Deku) is forced to overwork their bodies to dangerous degrees to level the playing field. And then, it happens. The thing we were told would never happen, happens. Gaara gets hit and is forced to use his real ability. Todoroki snaps and uses his fire. 
And this moment, right here, is My Hero Academy’s peak. It is the moment where all of its strengths converge into one incredible moment.
This moment is great, but its the last time My Hero Academy reaches anything close to such a high. This is where the decline of My Hero Academy begins.
Bad Parts
After this arc ends, the first signs of a recurring problem the show has yet to solve through season 4 pop up: Horikoshi declaring stakes and then retreating to a safer option that's easier to write around.
1: Stakes
So. This is class A’s chance to show off their stuff for potential internships and hero agencies, as the event is broadcast across the nation but also tons of scouts are present. If you thrive, everyone will witness it but the same is true if you fail. It could hurt your reputation going forward.
Class A is also threatened with the possibility of being demoted to a lower class if they underperform. This one is interesting, as it adds a lot of pressure to the fights with class B students. After all, if a class A student loses to one from class B, there’s a high chance those 2 will be switching places.
The problem with this one is Horikoshi doesn’t follow through with it, as only class A students end up advancing and no one from class B is promoted. 
In Naruto, all 3 of the sand ninja end up advanced to the finals of the chuunin exams. I liked this because it established the strength of the other nations, and indicated clearly that they're just as strong as Konohagakure and pose a very real threat to it. Which uh, yeah, turned out to be the case.
With MHA though, that doesn't happen. Now, I'm not saying that this decision is bad because MHA didn't do what Naruto did in a similar situation. Its bad because MHA does this consistently, creating stakes for a situation and then retreating from them, which constantly deflates tension and handicaps the potential for viewers to get invested in the drama in later arcs. Its not a huge deal here, but as you'll see when we get to season 3, it becomes a very large problem the series has yet to solve through the current season.
2: Deku's Body
Despite being told many times that Deku is risking his body by using his power the way he does, Deku never actually suffers any long-lasting consequences like permanently damaging his body, or being sidelined for a while so he can actually recover. Quick stop to the hospital and he's good to go next episode! This is again, not a huge deal now. But if you're going to create that subplot, you have to actually follow through with it somehow eventually. And Horikoshi never does, which again we'll get to in more detail in season 3.
Stain
So. The series is riding high after the sports festival arc, and I started becoming convinced that My Hero Academy could actually live up to its endless hype. After all, Horikoshi and Studio Bones proved capable of drawing out the show's strengths to overpower its weaknesses for one great arc. If they can keep doing that, the series is bound for greatness.
But like I said earlier, the decline of the series begins after the sports festival arc. And that decline starts with the show's next big villain, Stain.
Now, Stain himself is fine. Stain isn't a fan of current hero society. He believes that hero is a title that should only be bestowed upon those who accomplish good deeds. He thinks that the world has become overgrown with fake heroes, and that greed and fame have tainted what it means to be a hero.
The first time I watched season 2, I was confused by Stain and didn't understand what statement Horikoshi was trying to make with this arc, but couldn't really put a finger on why. On re-watch though, this line made me realize why Stain felt off:
""There are too many that act like heroes but are really money-worshippers"" (E28)
Okay, now think: how many heroes can you think of that fit that description? How many heroes have we seen that are greedy, that will take bribes, that are willing to compromise their beliefs for money, or became corrupted by money? That's right.
There aren't any. And this is why Stain as a villain doesn't work. None of the heroes of MHA align with the way Stain sees the world. His reasoning make sense, but its rather difficult to think of any that represent why what he's saying is a bad thing. All the heroes in MHA are too morally upstanding to reflect Stain's criticisms of society. The worst hero I can think of in terms of behavior is Endeavor, and he's the worst by a LOT. He definitely checks the box for being overly obsessed with fame via aiming for the #1 spot, but at the same time he is the only example of this. Ideally, you want your villain's criticism of society to be something that resonates, where you look everywhere and see it. With Stain, you have to squint to find any examples of what he's talking about.
As for the money thing, the only characters that come close to validating Stain's claims are Uraraka and Mt Lady.
Uraraka's motivation to become a hero is to make money, making her the only hero to have the motivation Stain is criticizing. And in her case, the money isn't even for her. Its for her parents. She wants money to take care of her parents, which hardly sounds like money-worshipping and doesn't stand to prove what Stain said correct.
As for Mt Lady: there are several instances of her acting like a jackass, but these scenes don't seem to be written in a way that criticizes her behavior. Horikoshi seems to be writing it as charming. And if Horikoshi is trying to say fame-chasing and the over-commercialization of heroes is bad here, then that message is contradicted by this moment in season 4 when Deku wins over Nighteye because he knew some absurdly specific fact about an All Might poster. I thought it was supposed to be a bad thing?
And just generally, quite a bit of hero society feels over-commercialized but A LOT of it is played straight, rather than more deliberately critical. I can think of many scenes where the celebrity status of heroes grosses me out, but none that I can think of and immediately say ""oh yeah, the show is very clearly portraying this as a bad thing.""
So for money-chasing, you have 1 example that sort of works and another that completely contradicts it. Not exactly an ideology that resonates strongly.
Stain's problem is that not enough effort was put into making his claims about society ring true. The show isn't consistent in how it treats fame-worshipping and over-commercialization, and there aren't enough examples of either problem in the show for either issue to feel systemic rather than isolated. And before you dismiss this as nitpicking, this particular issue is something other good battle shounens don't usually have a problem with.
There's a reason you feel some empathy for Scar in Fullmetal Alchemist. Because we know exactly why he's attacking state alchemists, and we know that there are bastards in the military that ENJOYED slaughtering his people, the Ishbalans. Beyond just that, thousands of other officers like Roy Mustang turned the other cheek or didn't take a stand. In a way, they're all guilty and deserve to be punished. Point being, we know what Scar believes and understand why he believes it because what he opposes is systemic in the world he inhabits. This just isn't the case for MHA. Stain is effectively opposing a strawman, a non-existent class of greedy heroes that we as audience aren't shown. As such, his words ring hollow. There's potential here, but you have to be willing to take risks like making more heroes less than perfect. Endeavor was a good start but you need more if you want a villain like Stain to work.
With all this in mind, its no surprise that Deku's takeaways from their encounter are nonsense.
In episode 31, Todoroki and Deku talk about their encounter with Stain, and conclude it with “its obvious we were left alive for a reason.”
Uh why is that? Stain left everyone alive! He failed to kill anyone! This ties into another issue I have with Horikoshi refusing to kill heroes. It isn't obvious he left Deku and the others alive for a reason rather than killing them, because we have yet to see him kill anyone. I don't want to dig too deep into this particular issue yet, so for now lets move on to Deku's other takeaway.
He also says something about in the end Stain was the only one standing against his opponents, which um??? Deku did that when he approached Stain in the alley? Deku's body moving on its own when someone is in danger or a hero is needed and so on is one of his signature personality traits. It’s THE THING that convinced All Might to pass One for All to him. So Stain having the courage or resolve to ""stand against his opponents"" isn't something Deku can or needs to internalize. It is his signature strength. Ideally, you want the main character to learn a lesson that they needed to at the end of an arc. They acquire some knowledge or learn something that changes them. This one is half-assed and isn't relevant to the character's growth.
Him being unafraid to stand against his opponents is literally his greatest strength. His takeaway from his encounter with Stain is meaningless! He already does that same thing, more so than any other hero! He's always done it! It's nonsense!
Deku not taking away anything from this arc due to Horikoshi's bad writing ties into another problem the show has: Deku as a main character. And yes, I did say I liked him as the protagonist in season 1. But that’s only in the context of season 1, ignoring the rest of the series. Now, there are things I like about his character like his thing where his body moves without thinking, and the way he inspires change in people reminds me a bit of the way Naruto does the same thing. But like in terms of him as a person? He isn't very good. There isn't much to him as a person after he gets One for All, they spend more time developing his powers than him as a character, and he has very weak interpersonal relationships with the rest of the characters except for All Might and maybe Bakugo.
But the problem I wanted to cover relative to Stain is that he doesn't believe in anything.
Deku Doesn't Believe in Anything
As you can probably guess, I have an issue with Deku's belief system. That is to say, there isn't one. And no, ""doing bad things is bad"", ""you should always try your best"", and ""never give up"" do not count.
I think Deku is most similar to Naruto as a protagonist, so that'll be the comparison I use to illustrate my point. In Naruto, it is obvious what the writer identifies as the bad parts of the shinobi world. It is war.
The event that caused Naruto's parents to die was an act of war. An attack by Tobi to get the nine-tails to attack the leaf village. Most of the villains are in some way raised by war, or the circumstances they currently face are the result of it.
Haku was an orphan due to an ability he inherited from his mother: Due to a war prior to Haku's birth, many in his clan hated and feared this ability, due to its association with the war and the fear that its existence would mean more war. These circumstances resulted in Haku's entire clan being wiped out except for him. He is now an orphan as a result of war. The same is true of Zaku later. He was taken in by Orochimaru after being found on the streets. And ultimately, Zaku was sacrificed as a means of another attack: the Konoha crush.
Neji's belief system of people being unable to change their fate is a result of his father's death, which was a cover-up to protect the family after a Kumogakure Head Ninja visiting Konoha took advantage of a peace treaty and attempted to kidnap Hinata in order to gain the secrets of the Byakugan.
Nagato ended up an orphan after his parents were killed by shinobi from the leaf village, and was forced to leave his village and search for food and shelter after killing those shinobi. After nearly collapsing from hunger, he met Konan and Yahiko, orphans like himself. They shared dreams of a future where they were in charge and could use their power to eliminate war. This group became known as the Akatsuki. They grew in numbers blah blah blah, and eventually the leader of Amegakure (Hanzo of the Salamander), felt threatened. Hanzo pretended he would work with the Akatsuki so that he could ambush Yahiko and Nagato, with support from Konoha's Danzo. Some shit went down, Yahiko dies, and Nagato severs all ties with Amegakure.
Yahiko's death ultimately convinced Nagato that his philosophies about achieving peace were foolish; the world would never willingly end the cycle of death and hatred it had operated on for so long. Only through direct experience of war and all the losses and agonies it brought could anyone truly desire peace.
The scars of war are inflicted on many characters throughout Naruto, and Naruto himself embodies the things that the shinobi world needs to change, such as a willingness to forgive those who don't deserve forgiveness (such as the villagers who shunned him as a child) and compassion even towards your enemies.
The fact that Deku doesn't have a similar level of depth is for a lot of reasons, but a large part of it is that the villains lack an ideology that is followed up and/or informed by the world around them.
Deku doesn't represent a change needed in hero society. He just wants to be like All Might. The villains all say there are problems with hero society, but none of them actually have a point. When you look at what Pain says about continuing the cycle of death and hate, you understand what he's talking about. Because you've seen it in tons of characters. Naruto having to live in a village that hates him for something he can't control and having to grow up alone because his parents were killed during his birth. Sasuke's entire clan was wiped out. His entire existence is based around getting revenge and killing the person responsible. Tons and tons of examples.
And when I examine MHA's world in a similar way based on Stain's ideology, there's very little there. The things that the villains claim are just that, things that Horikoshi wrote for them. They aren't based on anything Horikoshi worked into MHA's world. As a result of all this, the villain arcs of MHA feel hollow. The pieces are there, but by not having opponents or a world that challenge the protagonist as a person, there isn't that emotional core they need. I really wish Horikoshi would just change his approach to writing villains to something more simple, as he never puts in enough effort to make a villain like Stain work.
Or alternatively, write a villain based around your protagonist. Remember when Deku didn't have a quirk at the beginning of the series and it frustrated him to no end? Write a villain around that. You could very easily write villains that abuse their powers and don’t appreciate what they have. That's something that would naturally infuriate Deku given he knows what it’s like to not have a quirk at all. I thought this is what he was going to do with Overhaul, but the show never touches on the idea.
Before I go further, I'd like to clarify this so my point doesn't get misconstrued: Stain isn't bad because he isn't Scar, and Deku isn't bad because he isn't Naruto. Stain doesn't work because he requires the world to be written in a certain way, and Horikoshi's failure to do so has a negative impact on Deku's potential development, and that impact is best illustrated by other, more effective protagonists like Naruto and better villains like Scar.
Conclusion
That's about all I have to say for season 2. It’s harder to judge than season 1 because half of it is great and the other half is...sloppy. Overall though I think its decent, and has yet to hit truly bad.",6,Buuubbblesss
33486,"
                I'll be honest, as good as My Hero Academia season 1 was, it wasn't anything spectacular. It was a bit slow to getting started, Izuku and cast were getting introduced, and it was far more laid back overall. Not that it didn't have great moments of course, but it wasn't, in my opinion, what people hyped it up to be. It was an origin story, which are usually a bit tedious when getting through. But it was good enough to get people interested in the series, which it does good at.
Now season 2 of My Hero Academia? That is when things become truly amazing. 
It's
                  been a long time since I've gotten into a series in which the second season so far exceeded the first that I became this hooked into a series. After the big fallout of a lot of long running Shonen titles, I thought that One Piece was going to be the only survivor of the genre. But to my pleasant surprise, a light shined through in the form of HeroAca. 
Season 2 starts off strong, jumping immediately into the UA festival. We're finally able to see the development from the other characters as well as Izuku, namely Todoroki and Uraraka, the underdog of the tournament. The arc doesn't feel too long either and doesn't dwell on certain fights longer than it needs to like previous shonen anime have. The best fight lasts for an episode and even includes the flashbacks, compacting it well enough that you appreciate the backstory and the fight all at once.
But that's just the beginning of the season. The Stain arc that comes in the middle is nothing to shy away from. Not only is it Izuku's training arc, but it also introduces a villain that almost anyone could like. He's an idealistic killer who aims to clean up societies heroes who he deems unworthy, which is almost an oversimplification of his conviction and is best shown by Stain himself. It also serves as development for Iida, who I found pretty annoying in the arc, but that's just a personal pet peeve. 
Anyways, I could go on about the season 2 and how vastly superior it was to season 1, but I won't do that. Overall the animation and the music was on point, You Say Run still serving as a great amp for certain scenes, but the Villains Theme also shining quite a bit thanks to Stain. The characters were all on point, and Izuku has become one of my favorite protagonists of a Shonen series in both his personality and the fact that he goes against the usual grain of Shonen protags with his low self confidence but well thought out battles rather than just punching his way through. Which there's nothing wrong with, but it's nice to see a protagonist like him shine so well without the same tropes going for him aside from the messy big hair. 
All in all, I would recommend HeroAca to everyone. Push through season 1 to get to the amazing season 2.",10,Star_Plat1num

                Great 2nd season! I pretty much don't have that much else to say that isn't the same as my review for season 1, so I'll just quickly rephrase all of that: AMAZING soundtrack, generic/formulaic but enjoyable plot, and likeable characters.
The overall pacing is a bit strange. To me, the fight with Stain felt like it would be the big climax, but then the season ends with finals, which are interesting but not as intense. But that's just a small gripe!
One final small note: I LOVE Captain Selkie, probably a bit too much. I would be absolutely stoked if he showed up again in the future.

                Overall, 7.
This my first review so take it easy, i am one of those people who read the manga first even before the anime is going to be launched.
Keeping it simple, i'm seeing Boku no hero academia as one of those popular shounens, but, the hype was so short and it's reaching some level of my disappointment.
Comparing to the big three (naruto, one piece, bleach) which three of them started from 'meh' to 'holy shit, that's awesome', BNHA is the opposite, they started with hype and they made the 2nd season a lesser hype, as someone who thinks that the 1st season was a huge
                  success.
In the 2nd season, the plot is solid but not so ""on point"" which made me think it's just another filler, and ended up with a climax coming from nowhere, though it's purely my opinion so don't take this hard",7,Sylphic
33486,"
                With the end of season 2 and a solid 38 episodes under its belt, BnHA has reached the point where most seasoned viewers can get a good understanding of what kind of long-running (which this series inevitably will be) series this will be. Will it reach the greatness of its peers like the much revered Madhouse adaptation of HunterXHunter? Or will it fall to the wayside of filler hell and dead-horse-beating of Fairy Tail? 
Well, so far it definitely seems to be leaning towards the latter more than the former. 
Make no mistake, I'm not critiquing the show based on its fairly predictable storyline that
                  inevitably comes from being part of the shonen genre. Quite the opposite, I enjoyed just how much the show embraces the cheese and silliness that comes with these kinds of stories, and it felt like a nice change of pace from the unusual amount of grit/edge in the action-oriented shows of recent seasons. Sometimes less is simply more, and in the actual battle/character growth departments, BnHA does itself a massive service by not trying to become too philosophical with its messages. 
Which is why I also think that the show did a marvelous job at developing its main cast of characters. A common criticism leveled at S1 was that BnHA simply just bit off far more than it could chew with only 13 episodes at its disposal as it simply it not possible to develop 4-5 main characters with roughly 15 supporting characters in that time frame. But S2 really does do a great job with the 25 episodes at its disposal and wastes no time in getting the viewer to care for and at least understand most of the prominent cast members. Of course, the execution isn't flawless as the show relies HEAVILY on flashbacks and, several students in class A like the naval laser dude or the sugar rush guy get more than 4 minutes of total screentime over the course of the entire season, but by and large I could appreciate the growth of Deku, Uraraka, Todoroki, etc. as they faced great ordeals. 
A notable exception to this, however, was Bakugo who despite having basically an entire episode dedicated to him, wasn't given even a smidge more depth beyond his psychotic personality. The only thing that his flashbacks revealed was that he was a psycho since he was a child, which isn't really fleshing out his character archetype anymore than his first reveal in S1. 
But despite the show itself being a glorious celebration of the spirit of the shonen genre, there's one thing that the show seems to fundamentally misunderstand; a shonen story is only as good as its antagonist permits, and in this regard BnHA fails at a spectacular level that some of the more antagonized series like Bleach and Naruto got right for the most part. 
Shigaraki Tomura is possibly the most boring and bland interpretation of evil incarnate that you can possibly imagine and it was to the point where you can basically predict what he's going to say every time he's on the screen. Kill All Might, disrupt the peace, do evil things in the society because there are good guys, etc. etc. 
this guy is about as thought-provoking as a blank sheet of paper and about as intimidating as a child on Halloween. He might strike fear into the hearts of our heroes, but as a viewer, it was an unimaginative experience at best and a downright chore at worst. 
I feel this issue is further compounded by the fact that the one interesting villain that does appear in the middle of the season, Stain, has his entire arc wrapped up in about 4 episodes flat which was a colossal slap in the face. Having Edgelord Tomura as the main antagonist is one thing, but promptly doing away with the most interesting character of the entire show in such a short amount of time feels like a travesty. It's as if the show had found a solid bar of gold in Stain, and promptly threw it into the fiery pits of Mount Doom after struggling to understand how to use it properly. Just to add insult to injury, the final fight against Stain was so underwhelming I couldn't help but yell ""That's it?!"" at my screen. Convenient shonen power ups aside, you'd think that such a hyped villain who earned the title of ""Hero Killer"" would get more than like 30 seconds of actual fighting time vs high school students regardless of the amount of ""nakama spirit"" that flows through them. 
In the end, if you loved S1 and just want to see what kind of shenanigans Deku and his crew end up in then S2 is an obvious no brainer and an excellent watch. As mentioned earlier, as a season of character growth there's very little to fault in S2. 
But if you're looking for compelling villains along the lines of the Homunculus, Meruem, Hisoka, Aizen, etc., characters that actually serve as interesting antagonists to the overarching storyline, you're looking at 25 episodes of disappointment.",7,DHKany

                Following the release of Boku no Heros anime adaptation, the story of a world filled with superheroes have taken the anime community by storm. The first season had set up its characters and premise. And the second season is builds upon this. 
- Story - 
After the incidence at USJ facility, the students are back getting ready for the Sports Festival. Here they have to fight against each other. Either in teams or alone. Meanwhile a dark presences is lurking around in the city, killing or injuring heroes. Most shounen have these types of setting with training or fighting lessons, some of them are enjoyable
                  and others not so much. Luckily Academia does not the same mistake. Many of the fights at the festival are really enjoyable to watch and not all outcomes are easy to predict. The plot is playing safe, but never gets dull or boring. I was hoping for it to take more risks, but I cannot deny that I never found any bad moments in it. 
- Characters - 
One of the problems I had with the first season where the characters. Most of them where not bad, but lacked any depth to them. Thankfully this season gives us more change to know more about their personalities and development. There are still some that I feel are lacking, but I'm happy to see the Academia making a effort to explore its characters, telling each of theirs motivation for wanting to be a hero. But I do have a small gripe with the villains. I would like to see more exploration of what makes a villain a villain. It tries to do this with the Hero Killer, but I still feel it could have done a better job exploring this theme. Hopefully we see more of this theme explored in the third season. 
- Sound - 
The voice acting is superb.  As for the soundtrack I expected no less. The first season had some really great tracks and the composer Yuuki Hayashi delivers again. Tracks like Jet Set Run, Tori ni Iku and Kimi no Chikara really sets the tone while other tracks like Bakusatsuou are kick ass listening to. I watched it with the Japanese audio so I cannot comment how the dub is. 
- Art & Animation - 
Bones has once again done a great job. The animation quality is very consistent, the art style may not be for everyone. But going for a comic like style is in my opinion not a bad choice at all. It is not overdone as I have seen from other series. There is many colors involved, making the animation feel vibrant and satisfying to watch. All the fights is animated without any use of bad CGI which many anime tend to to these days. Many anime tends to drop the quality with bad facial animation but Academia has none of these issues thankfully. 
- Enjoyment -
If we are talking pure enjoyment, Academia delivers. Not every episode are great, but non felt boring to watch. 
Overall I give Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season a 8. I do feel its a bit too high score to give but it is hard to ignore the enjoyment found in it. I have gotten tired of superhero themed series a long time ago, but Academia lights my interest in it again. I think most people will find enjoyment in it even if they are not into superheroes. As long one does not go into this with unrealistic expectations then they should find some enjoyment in it.",8,StormTruck

                I've decided to write this review since i rewatched it due to people telling me to... but i can't mark it higher than this. It has 4/10 because of boobs juggling nothing else. Everything else was just mere dogshit. (again, like for my review of its first season)
Dude sacrifying himself for greater good. Where did i hear that? Oh, in like every second anime there is. I mean thats not a bad thing! BUT... EVERYONE THERE IS LIKE THAT. Everyone wanna become a hero. It just don't even fit their character if u ask me. Bakugo is screaming asshole which is like 10k miles away
                  from how real hero should look like. Edgy shitheads like Kaminari, Kirishima and Todoroki are like pain in ass and are almost useless. Only good thing is, they just waste your time so you should not focus on actual main character which is still crying pussy even 30 eps in. 
There ain't single character even in this season that have like other ambition than becoming a hero. Like they are basically people with no dreams and it kinda goes against point of anime. Even simple anime like for ex. Naruto got people who got different dreams and goals in it, even if it goes for fillers. This one? All 600 characters got one dream and thats it. 
Everything just feel like author underdeveloped main character. I mean, it's fine if u develop more to the side characters but those being more powerful and impactful than main? Cmon, that's not how you make your show interesting for people who watched anime for years and have some brain to think about it. Fanboyin/fangirling about side chars everywhere cause main char sucks and then anime became popular cause of it. This ain't hero anime, it's more like reverse harem with fucking yaoi vibe behind it. Fuckin' disgrace and disgusting.
Stereotypical main character with supporting another stereotypical female character ain't anything new but making it that way supporting girl having 0 impact and being good as a sexual object basically with obscene scenes. Uraraka is underdeveloped as well if u ask me. She got like two good traits, family issues and wanna become a hero cause of money gain, cool, but for main character... and thats it? Even some sidecharacters as Todoroki - he was inconsistant throughout whole season and basically changed his ideology, perspective and basically whole character in really short time. Change isn't bad if you let that character to be a consistent part of the story not doing basically anything just another ordinary character which is copy/paste of the main roster.
This anime is praised cause of simplicity of its own characters. Yet they aren't even simple. They are much more simpler than simple. If you watch anime you look for a connection between you and some of the characters right? This is missing here as well. I get it not every character is loveable and you can enjoy a story without liking none of them but...the story is at best average. 
I despise the show. Can't really connect with characters like there's barricade or something. As I've said in the beginning of this rant, the only thing i enjoyed was the animation cause its studio Bones is doing their work. I wanna finish the show but making it like 80+ episode crap is gonna be hard even tho i'm basically almost halfway mentally done with that shit.",4,Shiniya

                I personally think that Deku should be called the 'green flash' or 'mighty green'
ik that deku was a name that changed his way of thinking the meaning behind it, anyways i just think his name should of had more meaning or like a bit longer so yea, also the name 'green flash' makes him sound fast which he kinda is and the name 'mighty green' comes from his strength that 'ALL MIGHT' gave him so i just thought youd want to hear this so that's my 10 cents in

                Pretty good season 2 so far(14 eps) not really that different from the first season, and it follows the manga which I love and, which OPM is starting to deviate from its source material.
Pros: Great character relationships, class rivalries, various powers.(The same as before). Tournament.
Cons: Episodes are streched a bit. Lower scores for same-ness as Season1.
~SPOILERS~ 
Now onto the actual review ~may contain spoilers~ MHA is a very good anime it is paced slower then the manga but there are reasons for this to split it into arcs which are easier to maintain and we don't run into the ""One Piece"" syndrome of the manga/anime
                  reaching the same point.[also copied]
Deku now is ready for one-on-one battles vs other students. He still needs to restrain his power but he's slowly getting used to it. That's really it the competition was the entire arc as of this point 14 episodes in and they start hero apprenticeship.",9,MasterSenpai101
33486,"
                The second season (to me at least) is where BNHA truly shines so far (maybe it will also in season 3, we shall see ;) ) Let's go down the list shall we?
Story: Again, nothing new. A tournament arc, a training arc, and a final exam arc. We've seen these done at their best and at their worst and honestly, BNHA is one of the best for all three. 
The tournament arc is hard to explain, but at the same time not really. It doesn't just focus on Deku and his fight to rise to the top, but rather the entire 1-A class as a
                  whole. There's match ups that  are downright one sided, but instead of showing how strong the winner is (because you already know), it shows you how strong the losers are. That the losers deserve to be in the class just as much as the winners do and their spot is earned. You see everyone shine and everyone lose and I'm so thankful that the creators knew what they were doing with this arc. It was very nice to see the fights resolved quickly instead of dragging them out for multiple episodes like other anime do. BNHA shows how a tournament arc should be done.  
The training arc is pretty basic as well. The class needs to go do internships with Pro Heroes so they know what the whole business is really like. Again, Deku isn't the only main focus of this arc, and that's really nice to see other characters take the spotlight. Everyone (not just Deku) gains something from this arc, whether it be emotional or physical strength. The fights weren't too long and it balances well with the talking aspects of it. 
The final exam arc is another basic story. Finals are coming and to pass the year they have to complete their finals. Same as the tournament arc, none of these fights are drug out with useless filler and powering up and overpoweredness (is that even a word?). 
Characters: This is truly where the second season shines to me. Most of the characters (if not all) get at least some kind of development that's very nice to see. They're not just carbon copies from other shonen, but rather students that have goals and they're all attending UA for a reason. The standouts for season two are without a doubt Uraraka, Iida, Tokoyami, Todoroki, and All Might. But that again doesn't mean they are the only ones who get development. Everyone proves to be more than what they were in the first season, and its shown so very nicely. 
Nothing changes with art and sound :). The only difference is that season two has two openings instead of one. 
Overall Enjoyment: I actually enjoyed the second season more than the first season. A big factor to me is not what the story is, but rather how its told. The first season to BNHA is more like a prologue and should probably be treated as such. The hype still very much deserved and I still recommend it very much :).",9,Unicorn819
33486,"
                If I already liked the first season so much, I had no doubts that I'd like the second season. I just had no idea HOW MUCH MORE, to the point of almost giving it a 10!
The second season of Boku no Hero takes what we already know and love about the story and takes it to a next level. You liked a character? Here's them being badass. You wanted to know more about a character? Here's more screentime and/or a flashback. You wanted some answers? Here's a few, just so you can get more interested and invested in the story. And so on and so
                  on.
My only complaints are regarding two characters. Yes, I'm looking at YOU, Bakugou and Mineta! See, I already disliked them in season 1, but I had hopes that Bakugou would get better and while I didn't like Mineta, I ignored his pervy ways. In this second season, Bacchan manages to be EVEN MORE OF AN INSUFFERABLE ASS than he was before! And Mineta, well, he's still the same. The problem is that I can no longer ignore what he does/how he is and it's pissing me off.
But, well. That's 2 characters that I hate versus SO MANY MORE that I actually like/love (including the villains, which are ALL interesting). So it's not like I'd drop the anime.
Another thing that I'm absolutely LIVING for is the soundtrack. I already liked it in s1 (again), but now I got to pay attention to it all and yep, You Say Run and Sora Ni Utaeba are my new hymns. Take me to fucking church.
I'll be recommending this shounen to everyone I know, it is SOOOOO worth it!",9,isahbellah

                Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season, or My Hero Academia, but I like to call it My Cliché Academia/ My ""Hero"" Academia.
I have no idea how but they managed to make it worse than the first season, of course, those reading must be like how? The scores on the second are better than the first, sorry kiddo but it ain't any better and I got a chunk of explanation to back my view up. Plus, if this is the highest-scoring season out of the series, god am I not excited by the next one. To start, why the fuck did they take so long at
                  the sports festival plot. A long chunk of 11 episodes just to fit the festival, what's worse is that it doesn't even feel complete. What do I mean by complete? I just feel that it served very little purpose to the plot and that it didn't even touch on all the characters. The majority of the screen time is on Midori or Baku or Todoroki, every other character just felt like being dusted under a rug. Plus, why does the show say Midori is quirk-less? He clearly has the power of unlimited tears and word rambles. By no means is the festival close to being fair, the match-ups are fucked, rules kinda crooky and hell, how does this even add up to a ""school sports festival"". I know you must be thinking that it's the UA Academy so it's fine but that's not what I'm going for. A sports festival is somewhat base on sportsmanship and while competitiveness plays a part it is not the dominating factor. What the show did was remove any forms of sportsmanship and built beating others as the top ideology. My gosh was it a pain to see all the students so desperately trying to beat one another, like it's so bad that it's pointless of the whole 'festival' gimmick. But whatever, I'll swallow the pill, but what they showed was absolute bullshit, an example is Midori versus Shinsou (mind control dude). In no way should Midori have won but he still won anyways due to stupid plot armor, damn was I piss when I saw that, cause I really liked the Shinsou guy. Urgh, now we move on to the next half where it's about them getting an internship. I don't mind the concept but how the show executed the scenes is just awful. What I find the most troubling part is the villain Stain's design, he just looks like a TMNT rip off. I love his intensions but his doings are just so poor, yes by killing more heroes will I get my beliefs out to the public. I mean he did but his character was such a sort termed thing. I know people applaud the show for its amazing fight scenes, but don't let that fool you from its painful and super annoying emotional moments throughout every fight that anyone encounters. Truly, this repetitive format is what defeats the purpose of the fight scenes for me. Must everything be so damn emotional? Like I appreciate the Slice of Life and the school life parts but it's always disrupted by Midori's ultra emotional thinkings or sayings. Additionally, I can see that the series is slightly underbudgeted or under-produced. Now, you might think that's ridiculous but it's true, have you notice the amount of reused scenes and the super heavy text load one character says. Plus I counted the beginning and end of each episode, you are only getting 18 minutes of screen time. Well, the studio does a good job of hiding it I just wanted to point it out. Lastly, the villain, still such a weak and unlikeable side of the series. Plus what's worse is that this whole season is just for Shigaraki to realize that 'oh, I remembered my job'. Truly the writer sucks at making a good villain. I can go on but I think this will cover it.
-SCORES-
Character- 6/10: Fuck the villains, trashy and unlikable as in the first season. Midori and Baku are like repelling magnets that the show just keeps trying to push them together. It is to a point where it's like a toxic relationship and it feels so forced. Clearly Baku can be a nice guy like to Kirishima but no, for Midori, I MUST BE STRAIGHT-UP CANCER and I'll use being a hero as an excuse. I love the other classmate, especially Kaminari. I just wished there was more scene time on them and not on Midori all the time.
Art- 8/10: It definitely spells out a very heroic kind of show, definitely love the ''EAT THIS"" moment. I just wished there was less talking during fight scenes are they would actually just fight for real without interruptions.
Writing- 4/10: So cliché that it's sad. I know the show wants to built a strong fanbase and I do feel that motive to get involved in the characters but majority of the writing is just dog shit and bad. An example of how it could have been more interesting is to see work departments that utilizes people with a particular quirk in that area. I just want to see more creative incorporation of people's quirk in life. I love that they explained that having quirks stopped progression in civilization, which is understandable but I feel that it would be more interesting to dwell on that path instead of giving some shitty and shallow superhero show about just beating the villains. Oh please.
Sound- 4/10: The first intro sounds as if the microphone is far away from the band and the second intro just feels as if the band is just giving their 'practice' go at the song. Also, the show had the balls to play super emotional music at emotional scenes just to trick the audience into it even more. A bold move and I hate it.
Overall, I feel like ton of potential is wasted here. I feel a reason why this season is worse than the first is that the studio stretched the season out to 25 episodes. This made quantity over quality which I do find a shame. I'm probably going to watch the third season but I don't have high hopes on it.

                So it is my first time writing a review. Although in all honestly I just tried watching Boku no Hero Academia just because I was bored waiting for the next episode of my favorite series this season but I end up really liking this series. At first I was like, ""wtf... is this one of the typical hero stories"" but although I must admit there are some similarities especially the ""nakama"" power that we all know exist everywhere but the story per se is interesting. Although you will eventually know that the protagonist will become as strong as all other ""heroes"" but seeing him fail
                  every now and then proves this hero is like us, normal people, who strives hard to get to their goal. So over all I find this interesting and to think when season two aired I thought it will be like any other anime where season two fails and didn't reach the potential as interesting as it started. Every episode you feel like you want to throw the table because you have to wait another week to the next release. And in all honest frustrates me that he's still far from being a hero but you know he'll get there. :) So I'd say pick this series you won't regret it ;)",9,fukachan

                Alrighty, I'm ready to go. Let's talk about season 2 of BNHA.
I'm not trying to make this an insanely long review because, to be honest, I'd rather be watching the third season. Let's start with art. Obviously, it's gorgeous. I have stated that I don't love all of the character designs in this anime, but as far as effects and backgrounds go (as well as most of the character designs), this anime is very nice to look at. Sound, from the voice acting to the BGM to the OP and ED songs-- I can't find a negative thing to say about them. 
Now it's time
                  for: the only negative things I have to say about this anime. They're not really that big of a deal, but to me, it's just a few things I would've changed. Basically, the pacing is a tad bit fast for my taste. I thought that the story could've buckled down on some good moments if only it'd slowed down just a touch. Also, the character developments weren't what I was hoping for. For a few characters, they didn't get developed much at all, some of them were only partially developed, and sometimes the developments came at a weird time. Mostly where I saw that issue was within the characters' abilities and how they were training them. I thought I would see a couple of them train their Quirks in a specific time period, but in fact, we only saw one character develop his abilities, and it was a little bit too late. I felt like the training would've been more effective if we'd seen it little by little from the beginning rather than all at once within a couple episodes.
That being said, the way that they developed within the story as well as the personal developments some of the characters went through was really interesting to watch. Something else this anime does really well, which I was sort of surprised by, was the fight scenes. Obviously, watching people with superpowers fighting each other is always gonna be cool, but the way this anime writes strategy or weaknesses or differences in effectiveness when fighting against different Quirks is freakin' awesome.
As for the story, it's getting to a really good place. BNHA is able to balance the genres it dabbles in really well. This season was especially good at that since the antagonists were getting developed into something terrifying, even though BNHA doesn't feel that dark a lot of the time. 
I don't really have a lot more to say that I didn't say in the first season's review, so I'm gonna end it here. Bottom line, BNHA is just fun to watch. Not every episode this season wowed me, and there's room for improvement as far as the story structure and development goes, but I still think about this anime 24/7 so that pretty much tells you what it needs to. Anyway, I'm off to the third season. See ya!",9,BabyGirl06301

                I've never liked shows like this; the young hero, his quest/thirst to ""be the best"" (cue Pokemon intro) but this series takes the gold. I refused to watch the first season when this show came out because it reminded me of HunterxHunter and I wasn't a fan of those types of shows. But when the second season was coming out, I figured I should give it shot, since everyone on reddit was freaking out about it. So I watched the first episode, then the second, then it was 3 in the morning and I couldn't look away.
Between the characters, the art, the soundtrack, my mind
                  was blown. If I could give my money to those animators directly, I would. So I did the next best thing and sign up for a streaming series instead of having to go on Crunchyroll and pray to find a guest pass. I've also convinced myself to buy the series on DVD when it comes out, even though I've never really owned much anime in my life, aside from movies. 
You cannot compare any other show out right now to this. I mean, this show does a great job of even highlighting the side characters, to the point where I root for them just as hard as I do for the main character. The soundtrack? It's 100% my workout playlist and inspires me to go PLUS ULTRA. I can't get enough of this show, to the point where I share my love on Social media, and all my friends are confused AF because I rarely talk about anime.
Seriously, if you haven't watched it, watch it. And if you want to talk about it, lets be friends!! :)",10,PlusUltra44

                REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS
The first season was like an introduction, a welcome note to what was coming in season two. If before only Deku was developed as a character, here we have the development of other characters and their powers such as Todoroki, Uraraka, Bakugo, Yaoyorozu and Tokoyami. 
There are more epic fights (the first archery tournament is very exciting), a great villain comes out and we learn more about One for All.
 In my opinion, much cooler than the first season! If you are looking for a lively, fun anime but this time, with a little more elaborate plots THIS IS IT!

                This is a great popular anime, but tends to fall into a lot of traps that shows like it tend to do. 
Firstly, this show is great. It has a lot of deeper themes about fascism, eugenics, and social hierarchy. These social themes can be a bit muddled at times, but it generally has a point to them. The characters are generally well written and given very interesting backstories. One example is of a character who is socially an outcast because his power is thought to be more of a villain. It has very interesting takes on society with superpowers and thinks a lot about
                  how they would work and affect the characters that use them. A lot of thought was put into how things worked in this society. A lot of shonen go for the ""friends are what make me strong"" theme and it does so here too, but in a very different and satisfying way. It is about cooperation and independence. You must be independent to be able to cooperate. If you are simply a burden you cannot be true friends and provide. This subtext is very needed in the shonen and I commend the show for actually exploring it in the second season. 
My criticism are generally mild. The most mind boggling one is of the female leads arc which is so pathetically thought out. Her arc is about providing for people, but is twisted to mean her parents do not support her becoming a hero when it is resolved as they say they accept her choice and are proud. That was not a part of her problem. She already knew they accepted this when they literally told her that when her problem was presented. No real women have any meaningful arc in this season which is disappointing for the representation as they botched this one so badly and it goes away so quickly in the season. In addition, it falls into a lot of traps of shonen that can be annoying again (The MC is a crybaby and Mary Sue). I think he could do with some more flaws, but a lot of the main 5 characters can stand alone besides conforming to these stereotypes, so its a bit saddening to think that they can't. Also, the MC saying that people are better than him, muddles with the themes of him working hard to be the best and ones of eugenics. 
A more fleshed out season than the first and a solid entry.",8,titaniumjew

                The chuunin exams are here, and if Boku and his friends want to earn their hunter licenses they need to be on top of their game.Yes it's a tournament arc, yes it takes heavy inspiration from many tournament arcs past. Yes Zuko Todoroki is basically Neji and Gaara and about a thousand other tropes. What makes Hero Academia special isn't the fact that it's original. It wears it's influences on it's sleeve. What makes it special is just how perfectly executed all these tropes are. Everything that made those stories that came before is executed here with surgical precision, and it comes together to create
                  some really emotional storytelling.
I thought I would have more to say about this season but really that's the gist of it. I think other's have analyzed it's deeper themes in so many words and there really isn't much more I could add. My two cents is just that this show isn't great despite obviously copying other series, it's great because of it. It does the same things and it does them well, and we are quick to make comparisons but the fact remains that it's a good story regardless. 9/10",9,lamaraptor

                Pretty good season 2 so far(14 eps) not really that different from the first season, and it follows the manga which I love and, which OPM is starting to deviate from its source material.
Pros: Great character relationships, class rivalries, various powers.(The same as before). Tournament.
Cons: Episodes are stretched a bit. Lower scores for same-ness as Season 1.

Now onto the actual review ~may contain spoilers~ MHA is a very good anime it is paced slower than the manga but there are reasons for this to split it into arcs which are easier to maintain and we don't run into the ""One Piece"" syndrome of the manga/anime

That's really it the competition was the entire arc as of this point 14 episodes in and they start hero apprenticeship.

Some of the final tests weren't in the manga but i'm very glad with how the turned out and i do love seeing the manga come to life as anime.

                Witnessing the terror at USJ, the future heroes of U.A. cannot stand back against the villains who plague in every hole of the city with eradicating the heroes instilled in their minds. They surely savored the overwhelming difference in power when it comes in dealing villains in a real-life situation. Hungry for power, wisdom and knowledge, they continue to march on towards improvement.  Thus, the 2nd season of Boku no Hero Academia has been unraveled to continue the journey of heroism.
After a year break, Izuku Midoriya and the rest of Class 1-A of U.A. are back in action to follow the cliffhanger-ed ending last
                  Spring 2016. This has been one of the most awaited sequels of a well-animated shounen manga by Horikoshi-sensei. Surely, the production team behind cannot let the hype of the first season to be faded to dust but planning, budget, workforce, and quality assurance are also big concerns.
Story (9/10):
From the Sports event to the Final exams, the writers really know how to balance the story well in a given number of episodes. Each arc is presented well, bringing to the depth of the story. But there are times that some situations are being sped up and could have been elaborated further for more thrill and excitement. Nevertheless, each story arc has been packed with action and emotions that are easily grabbed by the hearts of the viewers.
Art (5/10):
The art style of BONES is somehow unsatisfying on this one. Filling some essential parts like character faces with black shows the laziness or being time-constrained of the artists. It might be a blind spot if others take it as a consideration of being a style (as also employed in Pierrot's 2016 adaptation of Divine Gate). However, the character design has improved a little in comparison with the previous season but still remained the flaws of lazy outlines and scattering lines to show some emotions of characters. Generally, the art is left mediocre.
Sound (8/10):
The score for the series is typical for an action anime. Nothing new in this one but still enjoyable as it blends with the fighting animation. The SFX is remarkable although some parts were exaggerated. Also, Seiyuu(s) never disappoint the audience with their outstanding performance.
Character (9/10):
Character development is undeniable in this season. Seeing the main character, who's seen as mediocre and a wet blanket from the earlier parts, develop and became able to master the art of his quirk. This is not only for the MC but for the rest of the class as well. There's this also an interesting villain who's moving the plot by working in the shadows in the first part and eventually making a mark on the second part. The returning League of Villains is still on fire, although less of the screen time. Anyway, characters in this season are promising.
Enjoyment (9/10):
Throughout the course of watching the show, it's been enjoyable despite some boring situations and scenes.
Overall (8/10)
Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season, so far, is still loved by newcomers and long-timers, alike. Being an adaptation of a shounen manga packed with thrilling fighting scenes, be it with bare hands or with powers, it can easily capture the interest of everybody regardless of the age and preferences. Who doesn't love shounen manga? Bleach? Naruto? One Piece? Yup, they're all best-selling manga whose anime-adaptations have also places in the hearts of avid anime watchers. BnHA 2nd Season is never been a disappointment to the community but there's still a room for improvement. Hoping for a more thrilling and more improved 3rd season.",8,Aikii-kun

                Boku no Hero Academia Season 2 Review
Dated: September 25, 2019
This season tackles more on the improvement of the hero students, more on actions and excitement. It will start on school festival, highlighting the conflict between Todoroki, Deku and Bakugo. There, it will mainly focus on Todoroki's past, as well as the improvement of each hero student. It's a good part of the series as most of the characters have been given a chance to make themselves know, what their strengths are, how they deal with fights and obstacles. Along the series, they will come to encounter a serial killer whose principle is reasonable. It's like
                  watching one human who understand how trash the society is now and is making a move to change it. Hero Killer's belief really is justifiable. If not due to our so-called morals, then he is really doing the right thing. There, Deku will have a chance to try his newfound technique to use his power properly, but at the same time, face extreme danger. The finale of the season will show the hero students fighting with the pro heroes and how they deal with their weakness. Bakugo is really irritating, but you just have to understand how fragile his heart is, when it comes to Deku. Being superior to someone for a long time, getting spoiled on applause and compliments, being treated as so special really have a negative impact sometimes. Because you'll never know defeat, loses, or pain. You'll never be able to understand someone's weakness, and it will be hard to accept when the time comes you've face defeat. That's what I think why Bakugo is Bakugo. He just needs some time to understand what's happening and maybe some punch to realize what's wrong with him. Lastly, new villains have been introduced, and that guy with stitches is so cool. Going on to the next season!",10,KyasutoNaito

                The second season unlike the first is a lot more well paced it introduces characters fast but still leaves an impression and follows a much deeper storyline as the UA tournament goes on you get to see the driving force behind characters and each of there unique differences and traumas this is exemplified most in Todoroki's story where you learn of his abusive home life and find out exactly how he got his signature scar this season gives us a look into the darker side of pro hero life through endeavours actions and how the directly and indirectly effected the Todoroki family it also eludes
                  to an even deeper unresolved mystery in the Todoroki family that deepens our connection with the characters in my opinion this season shows what can happen when a Shonen tournament arc is done correctly as we get to see our main characters with opposite drives progress through the tournament almost enacting the war of there mentors (all might and endeavour) just to gain each others respect in the end this season pulls us in and confuses us as to who were supposed to root for in the end as there isn't directly one big bad in this season and that's a good thing in summary this is one of the best seasons of MHA purely based on how it differentiates itself from the average Shonen story",8,Ethansanimelist

                There is always going to be a debate raging about the Shounen genre. There is such a volatile mix of negative connotations, nostalgia, defensiveness and what have you. Every weeaboo has their think-piece about Shounen on the tip of their tongue, positive or no. 
To compound this. Boku no Hero Academia gets a supplementary debate about whether it deserves it's praise and popularity when compared to other works in the genre, or at all really.
Before continuing this review, know three important things:
1) I have nothing against Shounen. I think the genre is plagued with common issues, but I judge individual works on their own. I
                  don't make shows carry the cross of their genre, but I acknowledge if a genre has issues.
2) I like Boku no Hero Academia a lot.
3) I think the second season is better than the first, which I will explain shortly.
This season was amazing. It very much benefited from the longer run-time. The most impressive thing about BNHA is that it polishes the bare bones shounen formula perfectly. It doesn't deconstruct the genre like Hunter x Hunter, nor does it execute a complex narrative the way that Fullmetal Alchemist does. But these examples thrive on quality storytelling found in their very premises. 
Sure. The window dressing differentiates BNHA from other shounen fighters of course. Instead of Ninjas, you have superheroes. But it all comes to down to the same driving force of the main character.
""Local boy wants to be the best at what he does. Will try harder than anybody to do it"". The shounen formula if you will. 
BNHA is a reflection on a pattern we've repeated so many times before. It doesn't ask what new thing it can do, but how it can do the same better than anybody else. A sentiment that threatens to become too meta for my brain to plausibly handle. 
So this review will be short in terms of specific content. There isn't much to offer but brief, albeit glowing, praise.
The first season showed us a story that kept it's shounen universe character driven with hefty personal stakes that draw you in. It's cast gets excellently distributed attention and doesn't lose itself in it's humongous character roster. BNHA also isn't interested in the false tension that the First and Second wave of shounen were infamous for. It doesn't need to stretch things out for your attention, because it deserves it already. It doesn't need to play with you.
The second season, keeping with BNHA's polish trend, just one ups the first by doing it better. This is largely due to the longer season I feel, but the producers are great at packing a lot of content into small spaces. The villains develop well as well, which was more pronounced in this season than the last.
I genuinely think that BNHA deserves to stand with One Piece (manga. The anime is okay, but not the adaptation that One Piece deserves) as a genuine tie for the best application of the standard shounen formula.",9,WeeabooScoobyDoo
33486,"
                In my review of S1, I said that the thing that was very disappointing to me about BNHA was the lack of focus on the secondary characters or making use of its own extended universe. When I think of the very first shounen shows I ever got into, it was the Chuunin and Soul Society arcs that got me really invested, because both were great examples of world building and bringing something fresh to the storyline, as opposed to only focusing on the struggle of maybe three central characters.
To leave this review as spoiler free as possible, S2 of BNHA reminded me a lot of
                  the Chuunin arc in Naruto and I ended up marathoning the season in a couple of days. I feel that, unlike many of its peers, BNHA really reaps the benefits of long hiatuses, since in 30+ episodes I never felt that a single scene or episode was wasted.
S2 takes the foundations of S1 and really builds on it, giving us a taste of the superhero world at large, including some history that reminded me a lot of X-men. As X-men is one of my favourite comic universes...ever... having that same difficult mix of regular humans alongside those with quirks and the (sometimes unfair) rules that came about as a result of prejudice, I was delighted. I also loved the humanising elements of its storyline, such as Todoroki's back story (honestly, in S1 I never quite understood the hype for him, only for S2 to make him an instafave). The element of quirk heredity is something I've never seen in comic books before,  and exactly what I wanted in terms of melding US comics and shounen tropes together. Passing down techniques is something I've seen a lot in shounen over the years, but never in the Marvel or DC universe. I suppose the closest examples I can think of is mutants having slightly similar abilities to their immediate family and Thor's hammer at a huge push, so this idea of pedigree quirks is a unique spin that completely makes sense in terms of both universes.
In general, I loved the exams arc and the fact that characters (no spoilers) were actually given the chance to lose and face the consequences of their decisions as opposed to watching our favourites win over and over. It was good to see character flaws, especially ones that were not immediately fixed.
In conclusion, I would say that S2 was vastly superior to its predecessor, set up an exciting new arc and vision of superheroes (which I hope is explored even more) and I'm excited about S3. I don't feel like it's a perfect show, as I would have liked more backstory and information about the other characters and the world at large, nor do I think that it's for everyone, but it is fun to watch. I really hope that S3 goes a step further and I can give it that perfect ten.",8,kisarachan

                I watched both seasons of Boku no Hero Academia in four days. Whatever complaints I might have, I can't deny that it's entertaining. The fight scenes are exciting, I like the competitive spirit of the characters, and it's amusing to watch their over-the-top personalities as they butt heads.
It's not the deepest thing in the world. Even compared to others in the genre, a lot of the characters are boring or under-developed. Some of that is because of inefficient writing: this season explores Ochako's backstory and gives her some time in the spotlight, but it does very little to add new dimensions to her character.
But it
                  isn't just that. BnHA is a focused show. The tournament arc that begins this season is a good example of that. Instead of a sweeping story-line that explores all the characters in depth and dedicates entire episodes to every match, most of the fights are resolved in minutes and the narrative is mainly concerned with Todoroki, who for his part is probably the most complex character in the show. 
It's not a bad approach. It makes for a faster pace and lets the show focus more on action, which is its strong suit. However, it does lead to a certain sense of 'main character privilege.' One particular fight exemplifies that, and in that moment it's hard to suspend disbelief.
There are some poorly thought out moments too: one analytical character loses a match because she can't think of a plan on the fly, but it's hard to believe that she wouldn't have made a plan before the fight started. Later, a teacher announces his desire to reform one of the students and seems serious and capable, but it has so little impact on the student's behavior that it might as well not have been included.
Some of the narrative turns are more interesting. Besides Todoroki, Tenya Iida develops in a compelling way this season, and Deku becomes less annoying as he gains confidence and learns to stand up for himself. Some of the best moments revolve around Bakugo. Of the minor characters, Mei and Hitoshi are fun to watch, even if they don't have much substance to their characters.
Boku no Hero Academia is a light-hearted show. In this season, most of the conflict is related to competition at school, with only a few episodes where the larger plot intrudes. Even when it's more serious, it's nowhere near as edgy as the average episode of Naruto or Full Metal Alchemist. That's not a bad thing, but it would be understandable to complain that not much happens. For my part, though, I found the school events entertaining enough that I didn't mind.
Which is why I would call the second season definitively better than the first. I found the opening episodes of season 1 repetitive, so that the latter half had to redeem it. This one has no parts that particularly need redeeming.",8,Evillordexdeath
33486,"
                This review is spoiler free.
With season one going off with a bang I was really looking forward to see season 2, however I knew the series was getting 25 episodes and a tournament arc. I feared the tournament would drag out and we would have to sit through 25 episodes worth. I like tournament arcs but I think too much of a good thing makes it bad. However this is not the case as the tournament arc only takes up half of the season.
One of the things I felt season 1 lack in most was the fact that it had a huge cast of characters
                  and many were glossed over to save time in 13 episodes. The tournament arc showed us how to use it correctly in finally giving those characters somewhat of a backstory so we could finally connect to them. In the second half we get more time to not only develop the heros but the villains as well.
The music to the series flows very nicely as I sit here and enjoy the series all of the music really gives the atmosphere of what is currently going on. Whether it is the tournament where the music is loud and quick beat or we are hanging out with the villains and it low and creepy it really gives you an atmospheric mood.
The animation is really well done, I found myself yelling to my fiance about the action shots(which really annoyed him while he played video games ^^;). Every action shot had me amazed at how they could so nicely make a flow to show movement it may have not necessarily have shown us. You really couldn't help but be pulled in. While even it the more relaxed scenes and comedy sequences showed a very simplistic but not half drawn style.
The story really does a good job balancing serious with light arted comedy well in not being over done. Overall this series has manage to break the mold of hero animes we've been getting the past few years where the main character will fail and it's ok. I have really enjoyed season 2 and anxiously await season 3. For that I give season 2 a 10/10.",10,PhylloNakamura
33486,"
                So I binged this whole series in a week (of the three current seasons that are out) but I'll try and keep this focused on Season 2.
Right up I'll admit that this season was my favorite of the three so far, even though all three have their merits and demerits. So what I want to focus on for this is improvements from S1, what really did it for me, and what could have been done better.
Improvements: They really nailed the story this time around and somehow impressed me with even better characterization. For the story, having actual set arcs really fleshed out how the learning
                  process was going for each student. First the Sports Festival (I'm a sucker for tournaments) really showed some good match ups and the limits to the first year's powers. Past that, the internships they took had probably one of my favorite sections with Iida, Deku, and Todoroki when they encounter the villain Stain. Easily Todoroki shot from being someone I didn't really care for to someone I wanted to watch a lot closer. Rather than a brooding Sauske style arc, he quickly realized that all he was doing was emulating his father. Suddenly, he's coming back around and attempting to right his wrongs and actively NOT be Endeavor rather than focusing on not using his power. The powers aren't making him like his father, but his attitude. I kinda merged story into what I liked about the characterization. I was heavily invested in those besides Deku, Bakugo, or All-Might.
What it really did for me: If you weren't hyped up for those match ups, I'll call you a damn liar. Bakugo vs. Uraraka was one of my favorites of the season (without spoiling the outcome). The sheer terror of going against your class star just to try and not get instantly stomped, but the courage to persevere anyways. Past that, Deku's performance was also integral to setting the tone of his journey to become a decent and new hero. The actual tests at the end of the season also did a lot of service to the other students (Although I think that Sero got a raw deal in his, I really don't like his partner as a character and I don't think he adds anything to the show besides an interesting power). Overall, the hype and expectations I had going into each subsequent arc drove me through this series faster than I could have imagined. Even when they gave a conclusion, they led me right into the next section: ""Sports festival is to get internships, internships get you experience needed for the final exam!"" That's a great amount of foresight and drove me on the whole way.
What could have been done better: Just get Mineta the hell out of here. The dude has a super interesting ability that looks useless but had really interesting applications, but his personality is an absolute dumpster fire. I don't know what it is about the ""horny midget"" trope that angers me so much, but it puts me off every time. Every single other member of 1-A I have a distinct investment in, but Mineta just doesn't interest me at all. Also, I think Bakugo gets a little bit too much slack from the teachers. It'd be one thing if he had a shitty home life or something, but all he had was a good power and no drive to use it for anyone but himself. His words might say something about emulating All-Might, but his entire actions all just speak for selfishness. Honestly, not much that needs improving from this season.
Definitely check this out if you were on the edge or iffy about the previous season, this one will make you decide for sure if the show is for you or not. Even if you didn't completely like the first season, I'm almost certain the second will have you stick around.",8,AmericanSomnium
33486,"
                Wow.
So, I really enjoyed the first season of Boku no Hero, a very fun, motivating and well-written story. I only think it lacked a bit of characterization in its characters and well, it was pretty good, but I felt they could better in future seasons. And well, Boku No Hero Academia Season 2 did NOT DISAPPOINT.
This second season is superior in every way to the first, from the character to the story, to the action, right down to the variety of episodes!
Let's start with how great they wrote the characters this season. Meanwhile, in the first season, most characters were 1 sided characters with vague
                  motivations, in this season the character becomes so rich in personality, motives, and character arcs, it's truly great. For example, I love how they dealt with Iida's character, how they broke him by almost killing his brother, and how this righteous person felt so angry towards the person who did this to his idol, he went up to kill him. But because he was beaten by him because he was acting stupidly and selfishly, to the point that his friends who went to save him got very damaged for his fault. He then realizes his mistakes and ends up beating the Hero Killer. He realizes he needs to learn a lot still, and that he should never use his powers for selfish intentions, but always for justice and the well being of people. 
This is what I loved about this season, these character arcs that our heroes go through, making them not cardboard cutouts anymore, but human beings with flaws and reason. And that was just an example of one character, they made these kinds of arcs with all the main characters, and also some shorter ones with some side characters, which is always appreciated.
And then the story; both stories in both half seasons were very good and enjoyable. Every episode in the first half, where I was on the edge of my seat thinking ""oh my god! what will happen next?!"" and, so it was a really enjoyable watch. The second part, meanwhile different, was still as strong with great episodes such as ""Everyone's Internships"" and the final exams episodes. (I also loved Gran Torino's character).
The soundtrack was as expected pretty good, although not very memorable, and I wasn't crazy about the first opening theme, but the second one; I really really liked that one. I do think the best is still the first season's one.
And well, this season was really one really fun ride, and I really hope that the season is just as good as this one! Because this season was really excellent in every way. I can't wait to start watching the next season!
I give Boku no Hero Academia Season 2 a high 8/10.",8,1cherrybomb1

                SPOILER ALERT
Some story arcs and episodes revealed, but no major plot.
As a reader of the manga, I an utterly disappointed with the amount of unnecessary filler and changes to the manga. Although a little bit of filler is needed in anime, this season had more that it needed. I enjoyed the parts were they fleshed out canon bits, such as the fights during the festival and the final exam, but there were entire episodes fabricated such as Tsuyu's internship. The fact that this is a seasonal series rather than a long ongoing one remove the need to make space between the manga. So the only
                  reason why the anime production did this was to milk the series' popularity rather than stay faithful to the creator.
The worst part was the final exam arc that was changed to have each fight happen one after another rather than all occurring at the same time. - which I liked in the manga, but then adding annoying & unnecessary commentary by Midoriya and the other students taking a lot of the tension away from the tests. The anime had to put this stupid troupe of having some BS, unneeded commentary, as if the viewers don't understand simple concepts. I liked that it was almost a race/competition in the manga, and having the a team be announced as the first to pass shows how far ahed they are, but this was completely removed in the anime.
Like I said, as a manga reader I am disappointed, but I understand that it is still enjoyable for anime-only viewers. The art is enjoyable, nothing particularly stand out, similarly with the music. We had some more character spotlight due to the number of tests/exams and how much filler was put in them (again, I liked that bit). Over all, this season was still enjoyable, but i felt like I wanted to skip all the unnecessary bits.",7,abitofsalmon

                Story: (Spoilers)
I liked how the tournament was handled. Many shounens fall victim to never ending tournament arcs. Here you had multiple fights happening in a single episode, and the show is not the lesser because of that as it gave the main characters more air time. Since the beginning of season 2 there was an escalation between Deku and Shouto, leading up to their amazing fight in the tournament, which was a highlight of this season.
I also like how the hero killer arc was handled. It initially came in place as Lida's quest for revenge, but it eventually touched on much more. It was nice
                  to see that Deku is finally able to use his power without hurting himself. Unfortunately, I wished to see more of Bakugo during this arc. His internship seemed like a cheap plot device to not include him on what was going on. In comparison, Uraraka's internship was at least useful as she got better in combat; all Bakugo got was a pair of jeans and a haircut. As the hero killer arc ends, the main antagonist of the series, All for one, is finally revealed to the viewer.
Finally, the finals. It was an interesting way to showcase pro heroes that we've never seen fighting before. Bakugo and Deku get some character development during their fight, but other than that there is not much happening. The end of the arc fleshes out the league of villain more, with new faces coming in and preparations for the plot lines of season 3. With that said, the story remains a bit simplistic and linear.
7/10
Art:
Amazing animation, fight scenes and effects. 9/10
Sound:
Fulfills its role, and gives hype. I liked the second opening too. 9/10
Characters:
I liked the character development that Shouto got in this season. We also got to see Lida dealing with the injury of his brother. It is definitely an improvement over season 1, but other than that most characters basically remained the same as they were by the end of the first season. 7/10
Enjoyment:
The more accelerated pace that Hero Academia brings to the shonen genre is welcome and makes each episode to be enjoyable to watch. 8/10
Overall:
Season 2 delivers a solid continuation to what was a solid first season. Hero Academia is indeed a solid addition to the shonen genre. Though it could find better ways to use their characters and advance the plot, the show feels fresh and is enjoyable to watch with little to no dull moments. Looking forward to season 3. 8/10",8,azkuel

                It's about time I finished this anime! I've had it On Hold since before I joined MAL and I only just completed it yesterday! I really should've completed it sooner because it's ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC in EVERY WAY.
Art and Sound- 9/10 for both: I'm starting here because, frankly, nothing much has changed in this department. The voice acting is still top notch, plus the visuals are the same vibrant, comic-book style as before.
I will say that the art ends up backfiring on itself a few times in this season because there are some truly terrifying villain close-ups which are faithfully reproduced from how they looked in
                  the manga. But... the bright colors really dumb down the horror factor there. Bones still makes a good effort to bring on the creepy, but it won't ever be as creepy as the manga.
Story- 8/10: Finally! Season 2! This is the point where Boku no Hero Academia starts to get really, really good. It starts off with the UA Sports Festival Arc, and I'm just going to say it right here: This arc is the best tournament arc in any Shounen series I've seen. Sorry Chunin Exam, Tenkaichi Budokai, Dark Tournament, and Heaven's Arena! Everything in that arc goes in completely unexpected directions that are GUARANTEED to catch you off guard (well as long as you avoided every single MAL post, Crunchyroll article, and AniTuber thesis statement on it).
After that is a fight against a new antagonist who starts piling on the obligatory social commentary and meta aspects of the narrative. And to conclude the season is a new practical exam that's short and sweet followed by an intense interlude that gets you stoked for next season!
However, there is one problem with this season's story, and it's the last thing you'd expect to see in the new age of seasonal broadcasts. Yeah, that's right, I'm talking about the anime fandom's least favorite F-word: FILLER.
It's not too much, but I just don't like filler. Some might argue that it's the kind of filler to have additional worldbuilding where the manga could not. But honestly I have very extreme views toward filler: No matter what the content is, filler is made to pad out the show for whatever reason. If you don't mind having to watch an episode or two of beating around the bush or inconsequential sideplots, then it shouldn't be bad for your sanity.
Characters- 10/10: It's time for the students and teachers of UA to finally show their true colors! Everyone started off bog standard last season, but all that was just a pile of red herrings. In this season, we get to see the first of many deep and emotional character moments. 
The students start to learn and grow from the experiences they have throughout this season, and it's wonderful! If Horikoshi has been improvising the whole series thus far, then he's gotten REALLY lucky, because it feels like these character arcs were as preplanned as the narrative of One Piece! (which depending on how you feel about One Piece, is a good or a bad thing, but I'm saying it as a good thing in this case)
Overall- 10/10: This is a fantastic second season to one of my favorite shows of all time. If you can put up with the brutally generic first season, then this will pay you back for all that time in SPADES!
However, I'm not sure if I'd recommend this anime as a whole over the manga... I don't know if it's because the first season set my expectations to unrealistic heights, or the anime's much slower pacing than the manga, but I definitely didn't feel the fire quite as much this time (no pun intended in the case of a certain scene).
For now, I'll say that both versions are equal, which is what I thought about Shokugeki no Soma until San no Sara came along... UUUUGH...
But by itself, this season of Boku no Hero Academia is fantastic, and a great alternative to the manga. (Let's just hope Bones can stay consistent...)",10,Natsuki_Hyundai
33486,"
                The tournament season of shonen animes.
I liked how they used that to develop the characters more, and I like how they managed to do that with many characters, not just the protagonist and one antagonist like most animes do.
The way power, strategy and friendship are combined is very captivating, but to me, this season was very cliche, despite in my opinion, Boku no Hero being different from most shonen animes.
I also found the way they show us the background of some characters very interesting, because their past isn't there just to justify their actions, it's clear how their past hurt them, affect them, change them,
                  and we get to see all these emotions and dreams colliding, the characters understand they're not the only one who's special or who have a reason or a dream to fight for. Despite superficially sounding like a cliche shounen anime, I feel this season has more than that to offer, when you look closely, you'll see how the character development is way more interesting than the story itself, and to me, that's what makes Boku no Hero so interesting, the characters.
Of course, all that is supported with a very good animation. The music and sound effects are good as well, but nothing exceptional. I was fun to watch, but to be honest, nothing new. Many animes already did the tournament saga and certain things do get predictable. The point here is: it's an important part of the growth of the characters and that's what makes it fun, in my opinion.",7,Sigmazyal
33486,"
                I'd like to say that the 2nd season of My Hero Academia is the best season for the anime so far, the reason being the all great, Tournament Arc. When I think of Tournament Arcs, specifically good Tournament Arcs, the first thing that comes to mind is My Hero Academia. The anime is that good!
The story of this anime, especially this season had a great plot. The characters seem more down to Earth as the story goes on and you get to know more about each and every relevant character. The first season of My Hero Academia got us to explore Midoriya Izuku and his
                  situation, beginnings, and inner thoughts, but in this season we explore the rest of the characters' situation, beginnings, and inner thoughts more or less. In this season, not only did the Tournament Arc excelled but also the Internship episodes because, the story got a bit more deep into the Pro Hero and Villan world. Instead of just getting familar with the students and teachers of UA high, the Internships allow us to stay with the main cast but have an insight on Pro Heroes and their everyday life. To be fair the characters did make a lot of frusturating to watch decisions in this season, but in the end it ultimately helped them develop as heroes as they figure what a hero is to them. In addition the decisions the characters made were probably wrote in so that they can have a reason to grow and to show more hints to the themes of risk and reward.
The art I still love, but again the battles look a bit static, obviously there is motion, the characters do move, yet the frames don't smoothly connect. If the fight scenes were to be filmed with cameras My Hero Academia's fight scenes looked to be fillmed with stationary cameras on tripods, on the other hand the ideal fight scene would be filmed with a jimmy jib or by human. The new characters' designs were also great and I found that Hatsume Mei's eyes were clever in how they were drawn because it looks like a scope lens. The CGI was also unnoticeable at first glance, which many animes have a stigma with.
The openings for this season anime is amazing, particularly the all favored ""Peace Sign"" by Kenshi Yonezu, Kenshi Yonezu has a very delicate singing voice, so I was surprised how well it worked for opening 2, the opening was both a calm melody and a head banger. I could also definitely bop with amazarashi's ""Sore Ni Utaeba"", and I'd like to think that the backup singers were phenomenal in that song. The ending for My Hero Academia's 2nd season screamed Girl Power and I respect that because we need stronger females in current Shonen anime.
I really watched this anime with pure enjoyment, and hopefully you would too.",9,SMYunicorn

                (ONE MINOR SPOILER IN THIS REVIEW)
Rarely have I seen an anime, such as this, pick itself back up and reinvent a superhero story with such sincerity as My Hero Academia season 2
I'll be honest here, I gave season 1 a bad rap.  I harshly criticized it, only because it felt generic, and I felt no connection with the main character who was presented his new life on a sliver platter.  But to see this kid finally make use of his powers and learn brand new ways to combat villains and others using a seemingly overpowered quirk was amazing.  It was the first
                  time where I felt tension and uneasiness when observing the villain.  And the voice acting, wow, has funimation outdone themselves this time!
The art is fluid and gives each character a reason to exist.  They all stand out from one another with bright colors.  Not a frame was misplaced in this case.
The soundtrack was phenomenal in that it was diverse in track placement.  They fit the scenario in which they were presented.  Sometimes, however, the song got overpowered by the sounds of the quirks, but that's just a minor thing.
With any show, some characters are going to have more screen time than others.  That just means that usually they make up for that with the main ones who indeed did develop from how they were in the first season.  I have to give the development award to Bakago only because he allowed himself to work with Deku for the sake of winning.  I'm interested to see where his character goes from here
So, yeah, I did enjoy this show.  It's certainly action oriented, but themes of heroes and villians are explored as well.  Whose to say that either are doing the right thing in their eyes, am I right? This show gives shounen new life and gives hope to me that more shows will follow in its footsteps.  I am now convinced on the BHA hype and so should YOU.",9,BaloneyPony

                Hello fellow MAL users!
I completed season 2 of MHA yesterday and I still can feel the enjoyment I experienced while watching this. I am on season 3 right now and I can confirm that season 2 is the best season until now. 
This season starts with an arc of the annual sports festival. During this, the students are competed against each other to determine who is the strongest amongst them. I feel like this was the most fun part of the season!
I could connect with the characters and their abilities were interesting to explore. There are also moments when you feel like this character is
                  going to win but they lose. It will keep your eyes glued on the screen at all times! I was just smiling and that joyful feeling was fluttering in me when I watched this one!!
If I had to choose the most thrilling moments, I would say it was Bakugou vs Ochako and Todoroki vs Midoriya. 
The second arc of this season was Hero Killer Stain, which I enjoyed very much but it was not as memorable and fun as arc 1. 
The third arc is practical exams! This would keep you on the edge of the seat!! Especially the last practical exam with Deku and Bakougou... 
The teams that were grouped were such an interesting way to see how characters interact with others. 
Here is how I rank the arcs-
1) Annual Sports Festival
2) Final Exams
3) Hero Killer Stain
Overall, I give this season a 10 in all its aspects. It was perfect from my point of view. 
Please watch this!!

Izuku Midoriya is still the same. He's not fleshed out of his trope yet, but I find him more interesting in this season because of the handicap he is put under. Since he can barely use his power without breaking his bones, he has to work his way around that so the outcome can be more desirable, i.e. using only his fingers to distribute his power. His struggle and smarts made me more drawn to him. In the first three episodes of season one, he was painful as a character. After that, he slowly starts to become more likeable personally. His introvert schtick is getting
                  completely old. In fact, making your character introverted for a flaw is getting old, since nearly every MC has that as a ""flaw."" Even the peeps in YA have that.
I like this season because it gives other characters some lime light. It helps define their smarts, strategies, and cooperation. The characters are still not fleshed out beyond their tropes, so that might be annoying for some viewers. The Tournament Arc was simply the most exciting in my opinion. Seeing different fighting techniques, and the three things I listed above in the same paragraph made me more invested in the show as a whole.

                Separate and apart from the show I need to use this to talk about that grape head for a minute.  Anime hyper-sexualises women and this isn't something new.  The nose-bleeds and pervy behaviour and unrealistic body proportions of women (especially those who act oblivious about their figures and attractiveness in a ditzy way) is nothing new, and in some cases, like one-piece for example, it can actually be funny (albeit overdone in places); but I can only describe mineta as a full on creep.  The way he talked about the girls was and is disgusting and making them dress in those cheer
                  outfits to ogle at them??  So many of the things he did are unforgivable and it made watching the show really uncomfortable for me - not to mention the problems the show already had with some of the female costumes; let's be honest, what kind of teacher goes around dressed with half her boobs out?  Here is an example where the perverted jokes are just weird and uncomfy - they don't land and they're not funny at all.
Ok, now onto the show.  Despite some pacing problems in season 2 it was a generally fun time and the games were such a nice addition.  I especially loved bakugo's anger in the fight when he couldn't get todoroki to go all out, and of course, todoroki's turmoil with the different sides of him and his loyalties (very cleverly shown in literal form with the fire and ice).  Having said that, Midoria as a protagonist can sometimes be lacking - and it makes you wonder if the show wouldn't be better off if All Might really had chosen Bakugo as the next quirk holder of one for all; hell, even the navel laser dude might have given us some more interesting moments.",7,liliannexx

                Lol one of the most over-rated shows of all time. 
This entire show is basically a Naruto clone.
The tournament ark was just a bad ripoff of the Chunnin exams from Naruto. Most of the characters, just like Naruto, are useless. You got Deku who is just your traditional Shounen protagonist who has this one OP ability that he can't use probably just like Naruto's nine tailed fox. Bakugo is just a piece of shit garbage who wins every single popularity pole. Todoroki is some emo kid who has daddy issues. The female characters are useless, just like in Naruto. The second half doesn't get any
                  better.
The show introduces this one guy called Stain who was actually a well written character, who also has a rather op ability, and guess what, he gets his ass kicked by 3 teenagers. Bravo 
overall just basically Naruto with an extraordinarily toxic fanbase.

                Overall, a good sequel. If the first season was good, this one was epic. The battles were better (and more), the character development massive and there was some focus on characters other than the two or three main ones. Clearly the anime will have a third season, as many question still have to be answered, but they did a great job to keep the interest high throughout the whole series. However, there were some episodes towards the end that were just there to fill in the gaps, as the main hero was hardly there or observed from the TV the other students tests. Not that

                An amazing step up to the first season. Everything about this season felt more polished and fleshed out more than the last season.
The story has improved, which is to be expected as the episode amount has increased as well. This season does an amazing job broadening the story while keeping its original aspects the same. The first season felt like an introduction season while this time around, it's truly about the world and what they fight for. The story is rich in content and does an amazing job setting things up for the future without the viewer realizing it. It expands everything, from the world
                  they walk on to the characters who fight for what's important to them. However, this doesn't save it from being stale and boring at times, especially within the academy. The comedic aspect helps bring back the fun, but the stale parts of the story still remain.
The characters are a bit better than last season and don't feel like they are constantly being shoved in the viewer's face like last season. This time around, however, some characters get more love than others. Within the recent events in the anime, certain characters get their time to shine and become more than what they are originally thought out to be, while other characters are just there to fill space or act as comedic relief, which is sad. Better than last season, but the same problem then also applies here as well.
The animation is also of the same quality as before, with a bit better fight scenes than last time. The colors feel vibrant, and the art style keeps the comic book look. The fight scenes with intricate camera movements and angles give it a more impactful feel. However, there are also some scenes where it looks too average, and everything feels stagnant. Overall, good animation but has issues that aren't distracting unless you're specifically looking for them.
Overall, an exceptional second season. The first season felt like it was introducing everything to use while this season is using what it introduced and making something good out of it. If you liked season one, then you'll definitely like this season.",8,sloshforbrains

                While season 1 was very good I didn't think it was great as most thought it was. It served more as an introduction to the characters and the world of Boku no Hero Academia. This 2nd season on the other hand I thought the anime really came into it's own and showed why it's such a great shounen. The story was a lot more exciting this time around with great arcs coming one after the other.
The art and animation was of the same high quality that season 1 had and Studio Bones did well in emphasizing certain important moments when they needed too. The soundtrack
                  was mostly the same from the previous season or some tracks had some slight alterations done to them. The characters were really able to get some much needed development this season. Tenya Iida and Shouto Todoroki in particular deserve special mention in this regard.

Who knows? He might expose more heroes... but of course by the means of killing. The best part of the season is when Deku was rescued by the guy himself. So yeah, stain is the reason why I love this season

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
In this review, I will only talk about the things that got better in comparison to the first season. So no music or animation if it didn't affect something I want to talk about
Something I didn't like too much about the first season was the characters. They were all fun, but mostly one-sided, not very interesting and didn't get much character development. But that is something they really change this time. Many characters, even side characters, get development that makes them way more interesting. Like Momos self-esteem issues, Todorokis childhood, Lida understanding his own flaws, Ochacos self-criticism problems, and Izuku trying to become more different. And even though many characters didn't get much development, they were mostly side-characters who were still lots of fun (especially yuga, who's probably one of my favorite characters in the show). But it's a shame that Bakugo stayed pretty much the same over the show. I liked bakugo in the first season. I understood his frustrations with not being at the top, but I would have liked him to change a little bit of change in his character.
The show also introduces new characters who are interesting, especially Stain and Hitoshi. Stain, because of his different motivation compared to the other villains and Hitoshi, because he was handled almost like a main character (that he also want to become a hero, but the only difference was that Izuku knew how he brainwashed the heroes which it hard for him to lose.
But it wasn't only the characters who got better, but the story too. Not as much, but still. All of the arcs were interesting and unique. The tournament arc was made interesting because of the characters they chose to fight. How the Izuku vs Todoroki fight was made interesting because of the characters they chose to fight (and because of the character development), or how we get to see Ochaco not wanting information from Izuku because she knows that she is relying on him. I know most of my reason is that of the characters, but most good arcs are interesting because of the characters. The second arc, the stain arc, was made interesting because of the new characters they make. Stain isn't the usual villain, cause he is right in what he is saying. Heroes that do it for the fame or money don't deserve to be called heroes. He’s interesting cause the characters change because of him. Lida understands more what it means to become a hero because od him. His motivation is in the right on papart which is why Lida can take something from meeting him. But the main characters still have motivations for trying to defeat him. Cause even though he's right, he does it in a wrong way. He doesn't have to kill heroes so that the world understands who should be called heroes and who shouldn't and that's why we want him to be defeated. And the third arc was interesting, again, because of the character development they give to characters we wouldn't have expected. How Mineta chooses to not follow his perverted mind but do whats good for the future.
This was definitely a better season than the first one, and I am very excited for season three",9,Protogeist

This was also an improvement over season 1 with less drawings off Deku’s tears to annoy me.
Sound 8/10
At first I preferred the music off season 1 but as the show wore on it grew on me and overall I think it was on par with season 1.
Characters 8/10
Midoriya who is now known as Deku is a much improved character who improves his quirk (magic ability) to a much higher level although he is still generic the other characters are also improved for the most part with only really Bakugou the old school friend and rival off Deku being a real pain in the ass. Todoroki who is one of the most powerful students with the ability to use both ice and fire is also a good rival of Deku and is a decent character and has the ability to improve. Ochako Urrayo who has a mutual attraction to Deku is also a good character but like Deku could be considered somewhat generic.
Overall the characters are a big improvement  two more characters I’d like to mention are Mineta who is a not very powerful hero but is a hilarious degenerate who provides some good comedy moments and Stain who is a great villain who adds a lot to this season.  
Enjoyment 9/10

                The second season of Boku no Hero Academia, confirmed one thing, that if you find yourself attracted towards strong-arching story protagonists, this can be the show for you, or at least half of it.
Although we already know 'Deku' to be a wimp from throughout the first season, the character continues to surprise you with a high dosage of mental and emotional weaknesses, and while it is expected from the narrators to take this path, it seems as if the creators are just trying to milk the ""powering-up"" stage of his arc, either to stall for manga-anime separation, or because they've noticed they gained a pretty
                  huge following in their first season, which infers to the former point.
I do think that my view on this is fairly shrouded due to my ""One Punch Man"" anime mentality, where my expectations of the protagonist are obnoxiously high, however if you're of a similar mind when it comes to choosing an anime and whether you can take it or not, these characteristic 'inconsistencies' can be a huge deterrent for you.
I think this show definitely shows one track minded characters out of need to differentiate their personalities, and propel their unique quirks, however some of the character tendencies just don't make sense, Bakugo's especially, with his hot-head for no reason mentality, which just seemed to have been revved up this season, due to a falling out in the end of the previous season. 
Regardless, a great long-term story I believe plenty of shounnen fans will stay tuned for, but for those one hit wonder fans out there and 'op' character attractees, I'd say either watch something else, or wait for the series to be completed fully and then binge it, so that the strengthening of the protagonist doesn't seem too slow that it might actually irritate the skin off your body.",8,angrykltten

                My Hero Academia for me has done something I didn't think was possible again which was re ignite my excitement for Shounen . It has all the elements that your usual Shounen has but waht make this series different is the fact that it brings the emotion and storytelling that previous series failed to deliver on.
Story: This season tackles a few arks but the most important story it tells is the realization of the 1-A students of just how hard and how dangerous it is to be a hero. you see people grow there powers, you see them have to learn lessons in a very
                  heartbreaking way. We get to learn the crazy past of One For All and get to meet Gran Torino.
The visuals were really good, especially during the tournament. The fights big fights had some impressive animation.
I Love the soundtrack too, not as much as season 1, for me probably the most weakest category. I mean come on nothing can top Porno Graffiti.
Characters: My favorite aspect of this season, not only do you get a soul crushing backstory on Todoroki, Ida has a heartbreaking arc, you get to see certain 1-A students shine like Tokoyami, Momo, and an entire episode to Tsu on top of an awesome mini villain in Stain.

                MHA's beggining gave us some expectations about the story unfold. We had some evolutions and decays. Here we are for another review:
[Pacing] 9 - As always, it is very hard to sin in pacing. The pacing is fair. Fits perfectly with the lore, no comments about.
[Writing Characters] 7 - We had introduction of some characters like Mei Hatsume, Tetsutetsu, Shinso, Himiko Toga et cetera. Their backstories aren't that deep. But it is minimally well done, just to create some triggers in battle, like Shinso vs. Deku or Hatsume vs. Tenya Iida.
[Animation] 8 - Compared to the first season, the animation got a nice increase. All
                  scenes are good in animation, mainly in fight scenes. It fitted as nice as it could be. Obviously, could be more better, but it's already good at all. At least, it won't bother you in no instance.
[Design] 8 - MHA has many characters. Taking this into account, so much characters had gotten nice designs as well. The new characters that were introduced, also has pleasant designs.
[Character Development] 6 - Again, at this point, charging too much for this topic would be kind of unfair. But some developments as Shoto were pure forced. Clarely, the best development was Tenya Iida/Midoriya.
[Lore] 6 - Tournament arc. A cliche that when have a enjoyable unfolding, gets pretty good. In MHA instance, no. The best moment in this season was Stain (Chizome Akaguro) vs. Deku, Iida and Shoto. To me, Stain was even better than Tomura Shigaraki (in this season).
[Fights] 3 - You can count on your fingers the good fights of this season: Deku vs. Todoroki, Bakugo vs. Uraraka and Stain vs. Deku, Iida and Todoroki. The rest is awful. Kohei didn't have the patience to think of good fights for other characters, which finished in like 15 seconds in average. So much potential thrown away. Could it make the season longer? Yup. But better a long season with good fights than a considerably short season with mostly bad fights.
[OST] 8 - The OST fits perfectly with the moment. In Shoto Todoroki vs. Deku, bro. Masterpiece. But it could be more used for other moments. As a whole, faultless.
[Overall] 6.87 - The enjoyment is pleasant. Some arcs and stories are a little bit unnecessary but it is tolerable. Most fights are pretty bad. Probably the worst point of this season. But overall, it's a good season. Watch without fear.",7,filipearray

                My Hero Academia is a strange series.
It has a terrible pace, predictable plot twists, an obnoxious protagonist and an even more insufferable rival. But it has its moments, good action scenes and interesting villains.
If you haven't seen the first season of this show, you can go on, because it's barely a prologue to this 25 episode second season, that is divided in three main arcs, one more predictable than the others: a fighting tournament, a fight with a    ninja with superpowers and an exam (which is actually another tournament).
To start, MHA is about Izuku Midoriya, a guy that has no superpowers in
                  a world where 80% of the population has one. One day, the greatest superhero of all, All Might, gives him his own powers and so he can fulfill his dream of becoming a hero. But he has first to graduate from the Yuuei, the most important superhero academy of the country.
Starting with the fact that a ""Superhero academy"" is a stupid idea, the point with MHA is that is pointless. The series would be about overcoming your own weaknesses in order to become better, but the protagonist, who has no powers (and this could be used in a ""I'll become the strongest powerless human"" scenario) obtains powers because they are given to him. He goes from being the weakest to be one of the strongest character with no actual fatigue (and no, a montage of him cleaning a beach won't convince me of having worked hard to achieve the best superpower in the world). It's like Naruto, who is actually from the start one of the strongest character in the manga/anime, but is hold back from, basically, being an idiot. Why I should care about such characters? And don't make me start talking about Bakugo, a character that is both a parody of the ""angry warrior"" (Wolverine, Gatsu) archetype and the apex of the edgy teenager.
Luckily, the author(s) of MHA created some fairly good villain, with Shibaraki and Stain, who seem to come from an horror film and who have some motivation. But what I liked the most is the commentary on the ""coolness"" of being a bad guy, on the fact that people feel fascinated from this characters just because they are on the dark side and have a motivation for what they do. It is interesting: finally someone tells you ""ok, the Joker may be cool and all, but you must remember that he's some f**king mass murderer"". 
I also really liked the arcs of the secondary characters, especially Shoto Todoroki, who has a great backstory with which many could relate to. Even Iida's storyline makes more sense than everything related to All Might, Midoriya and Bakugo. I could argue that one of the main problems of MHA is having chosen the wrong protagonist.
The action scenes are cool and the animation very good, much better than the first season. The sound design is very good too, but I find the soundtrack not that great, despite the famous ""You say run"" track.
My hero academia is undoubtedly funny to watch because of all the fights and the spectacle, but is very shallow and falsely inspirational, with a supporting cast immensely more interesting than its main cast. Its success is to me a mistery. Maybe the ""hero mania"" of the first 2010s due to the success of the Marvel movies? Maybe. But what does this series adds to the already existing 80 years (at the time of the release, about 75 years) of superhero comic books? Nothing new.",6,Euphemius
33486,"
                When My Hero Academia was released it somehow became one of the most popular anime of all time with its watch numbers surpassing shows like Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece, so frankly after I was trying to get back into anime I decided to check it out to see what all the hype was about, and after watching the first season my overall thoughts were that it was just... decent at best. Obviously, I couldn't be that harsh on this show based on its 1st season alone but I expected more from it. Thankfully nearly all the problems I had with season 1 were improved
                  upon in season 2 and I also think that this season is the best My Hero is gonna have to offer. What makes this season way better for me is the fact that it actually focuses on and fleshes out characters in the academy other than the protagonist. This show is called My Hero Academia and yet the focus is mostly on Deku, All Might, and other characters that aren't even in the academy, later seasons are especially guilty of this. 
What I instantly liked about this season is that it actually focuses on the supporting characters, I'm always fond of tournament arcs in shows as it gives the story a chance to focus on the rest of the ensemble other than the protagonist, and I have to say that this season (for the most part) does a pretty good job of doing it as we see each of the abilities the characters have and the different and unique ways they use them in certain situations. This season also does a good job of fleshing out characters, such as Todoroki and Tenya who were pretty much just NPCs in the previous season. We learn about Todoroki's backstory and why he refuses to use his fire bending and Tenya's reasoning for wanting to go after the so-called ""Hero Killer"" to avenge his brother after he nearly lost his life. Speaking of Stain, the fight between him Deku, Tenya, and Todoroki was also very enjoyable, because It's actually the students that are doing the fighting, It's cool to see the inexperienced heroes working together and trying different strategies to take on a threat that is too big for them to handle. The reason I like this so much is that there's a reason this fight is happening, It all started with Tenya wanting revenge then Todoroki and Deku coming to help him after he got his ass handed to him. I like fight scenes that happen due to what's happening in the story, I don't like fight scenes that happen just for the sake of having a fight scene, If Stain fought someone like All Might then it wouldn't have been that interesting. 
The only problem I have with this season is that Deku does not get any better than he was in season 1, he's still that annoying crybaby douchebag that just says the most generic shonen mc dialogue ever like ""I'm gonna be the best king of Hokages"" or whatever. There is a way of making the audience sympathize with the main character without making them cry like a bum every two seconds because at that point they start to get frustrated instead of feeling sorry or relating to them. I don't understand why the author decided to make Deku the main character, his entire backstory and motivation is just so bland if anything Todoroki would've been a much better protagonist as his backstory and motivation is a lot more interesting and compelling than Deku's ever was.
Overall this season was pretty enjoyable and an improvement over season 1",7,HamzasWeird

                Perhaps it's a bit of a dick move for me to say this, but my initial impression of the reviews with slightly lower scores is that they feel a bit pretentious. Classical formulas are classics because they work. Sure, some spins are always nice, but at the core, classics appeal to the masses because they're well structured.
This describes Boku no Hero Academia. I won't lie, I'm perhaps a bit snobbish myself, granted I've poured a fair amount of abuse in blasting shows like Infinite Stratos or Highschool Dxd--different genres aside--, but I've noticed a common criticism in many of the most highly rated lower-scoring reviews
                  is an expressed frustration at the work's failure to challenge the storytelling norms of its genre. To me, as said previously, this feels misguided.
I hate to admit it, but I held off on watching this anime for two reasons. One is that I tend to hate going through damn good animes because then I feel sad after, thinking I won't feel that rush of adrenaline and that feeling of ""Damn. What a ride!"", and the cycle repeats itself over and over. But the second, slightly more problematic issue I tend to suffer from is that I distrust hype. I honestly didn't trust the hype surrounding Boku no Hero Academia. Maybe it's vestiges of my disappointment surrounding major franchises like Sword Art Online. Maybe I'm just overly cynical. Regardless, I absolutely feel compelled to write a positive review for this anime. It absolutely deserves the hype it gets. It had me on a rollercoaster of emotions and pining for Deku's victories. The world within this anime is definitely very fleshed out. The battles feel so well thought out that they bring you in. The experience watching Boku no Hero Academia is definitely immersive.
It's been a while since I've felt compelled to bingewatch an anime, or even watch anime in general. That's how damn good it was.",10,acynicalasian
33486,"
                Once again, this was a lot of fun to watch. Season one felt like a good introduction into Izuku and All Might, and now there's a great 25 episodes to go through of learning more about the characters in his class and how they all grow and change throughout the tournament arc and in either smaller or larger ways in the second half of the season. I've noticed some things that people praise of or critique this season for, plus the obvious overarching criticism of the show, that it gets everything right for a shonen superhero-like battle anime, but it doesn't have any unique thing
                  to really make it stand out. I don't think this show or season is perfect, but I really enjoyed it and want to remark where I differ from these criticisms.
The first half of the show is a tournament, while the second half has various challenges that revolve more around the main characters. Some people like the first half because a tournament is nice and structured and leads to interesting character actions, and think the second half kind of plods along with things happening to the characters rather then them making decisions for themselves. And other people think a tournament arc is played out and they've seen it already, and really like Stain as a villain when he got his time to shine. I liked it all, even if I'm not as enamored with Stain as other people are. I love seeing everyone use their strengths and overcome weaknesses, and in my opinion the fight between Midoriya and Todoroki was the best of the season, having some Avatar: The Last Airbender levels of writing and color design at the end. I thought the changes between Iida and Midoriya shined more than Stain did during their battle, and concluding with everyone pairing off and fighting teachers is just so great and is again another opportunity for characters to express themselves. Aoyama's perfect self being the catalyst to lead to Ochaco's new fighting abilities for example.
I get that people like Stain and his The Dark Knight Joker level of villainy by being necessary to take out the bloat of the venerated members of society when they're not as noble as they seem to be, but I wasn't as moved by him as a villain. He's fine, but hell, the annoying, insecure kid from the B group is a more compelling villain to me. I like the twisted parents like Endeavor more and Shigaraki and Kurogiri, as the evil Calvin and Hobbes hold a place in my heart. They may not have ""done much"" this season and been more passive, but they don't just have an established league of evil to take over the world or even the clearest idea of what they want to do. They're basically figuring things out as much as the heroes. Stain worked better as a foil to Shigaraki and his tantrums than trying to be Light from Death Note.
Everyone seems to get hung up on this like it means they can only enjoy the show with an asterisk. I don't think there's much that isn't also seen in One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100. That said, there I like this show more than those others, I think because it has a good structure with its main characters and great design and fights that have the writing behind them to really make them special. A popular genre has its base characteristics that make it a genre. I like what's gone on in My Hero Academia. Midoriya's gaining confidence and proficiency in his abilities, and him and Bakugou having a moment of cooperation, even Tsuyu showing out in an adventure on the high seas and Mineta just admitting, ""being a horny bastard is who I am!""
My problems with the show are that it can get a bit flashback heavy as its means of filling in exposition and this may seem weird, but not enough filler. I would have liked more downtime on the show to let the characters bounce off of each other. I thought the mall episode would really show that, but it was more of a conclusion. That said, a mall episode as the final is never a bad idea in my book.",8,thestarsailor

                Warning: If you decide to watch this and have not read the manga, DON'T watch the 2nd to last episode's (ep24) preview for the next episode. It ruins the experience for ep25. I don't know if that counts as a spoiler, but I don't want people to make the same mistake I did.
I came into Boku no Hero Academia merely because I didn't have anything to watch and I chose it randomly, and to be honest now that I finished season 2, I couldn't think of any action anime more worth my while. The overall tone and feeling this anime sets really makes me feel
                  like I'm aging back 5 years, this is really something that helped me unwind after my long Saturdays of toil and labor. If you're looking for a lighthearted, action-packed anime that has its feels moments, this is the perfect anime for you. 
I gave the first season a 9 because I had some slight problems with it, but the problems I had in the first series all got fixed in the 2nd season, which is why this deserves my 10.
Here are some noteworthy mentions: 
Characters: (Boku no Hero Academia's defining quality)
One major problem I had with Boku no Hero Academia season 1 was that none of the supporting characters had any sort of development. I really, really wanted to see how unique everyone could be and how everyone's powers could be useful in a world where everyone is literally born with defining traits. Season 2 does a really good job of giving great insights to every single character in the class using the first arc and final exam, and it opens up a whole slew of characters that can match everyone, which really is a strength of this show. Most anime have only a couple characters, and if you don't totally relate to one, well sucks for you. But Boku no Hero Academia has a character for everyone, which makes it at least watchable for that one character you like. Personally for me it's Tsuyu, but each to his own...
Sound: (Runner up)
I feel like sound usually gets overlooked in shows in general but it's one of those things that you take for granted until it turns really bad or is taken away entirely. Just try watching a full anime muted, then try watching it with sound again. The openings and endings are really cool, my favorite being ending #1, and throughout the anime, the fight scenes are filled with youthful sounds that really captivate you. I don't think this anime would be the same without the kind of quality sounds they put into it. Great work guys!
This is one of my first reviews, so if you have any criticism/ideas for me please tell me! I want to improve as much as I can to share my experience with you guys.",10,Squid1030
33486,"
                A really great followup to the first season. Overall I think this season was better, though it didn't have as great a climax as the first season. That said, there was way more character development throughout this season which I loved to see. The Tournament arc is probably my favorite parts of the season, just because of all character exploration we got to see. Todoroki got some quality time during that half and seeing a lot of the other side characters get their time to shine really added layers of depth to the cast, making each character even more interesting. The character interactions are really
                  well done also. There are some pretty funny moments throughout the show allowing the characters to bounce off one another, making the group dynamic feel very natural. The only thing that I find hard to believe is how everyone still puts up with Bakugo after all this time. In real life, if any was like him everyone would just start to ignore him.
The music was another high point of this season. Yuki Hayashi is quickly becoming one of my favorite composers. His work on the OST for Haikyuu! is amazing as well. The animation is also pretty great. I loved the tournament arc and the episode of Bakugo and Deku vs. All Might was really fun to watch. All around this show is really solid. I don't think it's amazing, but I can see why it's so popular. It's very accessible and it's a really fun watch. Pretty excited to start season 3.",8,Hudsonwt

                This season outdid the first one by a huge margin. With a more focused writing and captivating action, My Hero Academia season 2 kept the promise and delivered nonstop fun throughout the 25 episodes. The sports festival arc truly is among the best out of what I have seen to date. It brings out so much of the characters, showcases them at both their best and worst, and does justice to their overall characterizations. 
The fight scenes, in the last few episodes of the arc, are breathtakingly mind-blowing, with hard-hitting character moments thrown in to back them. The other half of the season also provides
                  a very captivating thread, raising a lot of valid questions about heroism and answering them plausibly. Not that any other superhero film or show hasn't raised them before, but to see those questioned addressed here in a unique style is a real delight. The animation is still dazzling and the voice acting continues to dominate. The score is terrific and I want to listen to it more in the future.
The characters get to shine once again, especially Deku, the protagonist, who just never stops being relatable to a guy like me. Like the first season, this too is edited at a fast pace and that makes it hard to wait for the next episode, as a result of which one ends up binge watching one whole arc in a sitting, if not the complete 25 episodes. The perfectly struck balance between lighthearted and serious tone is astounding, because this is ultimately a show more about heroes than villains, which is why it's also full of positive vibes and exudes youthful energy not to found easily these days. I'm so glad this season lived up to my expectations.",10,PrashastSingh

                Very hype second season, mostly due to the tournament arc.
Characters are further fleshed out, most notably Todoroki, making them more easily to like. Backstories are revealed, and you understand the characters better. Stain is also a good villain, with an ideology that is very understandable considering the structure of this show's society. 
Plot is interesting and fun to watch, emotional beats land well. Fast paced and gripping, mostly due to the formula of tournament arc, the aftermath of the tournament arc with the hero agency is less interesting, but it picks up the pacing again with the Stain and final exams arc. 
Animation is gorgeous.
                  Fight scenes are epic and very enjoyable to watch. Sound enhances the experience by making the fight scenes even more hype, with the most effective and famous being You Say Run.

                It's quintessential shounen fare, which is to say it's great for what it is. As with the first season, the characters are what continue to make this show stand out. This season, this also applies to its antagonists. Quite a bit happens, and it's a nice blend of fun, low-stakes (yet very compelling) curriculum events and more serious, high-stakes events. Just about every character continues to be given something unique about them that doesn't just feel like a standard, forgettable side-character (even people from other classes than the primary protagonists' class). The thing that truly hooked me (more than it had already) was how the
                  story provides a nuanced approach to antagonists' motives, namely Stain who can be said to be pivotal to a whole lot.",8,TangyAbleOrange

I liked this season (and the anime as a whole) due to the characters, the progression, the art style, and Izuku's relatability to myself, and potentially others. The desire to become the best from nothing is a big challenge, and something I relate to with Izuku.
I disliked this anime because of how simple the story can be, as much as I love the story, it is horribly simple. I mean, you
                  can be 7 years old and understand this simple story for an anime that appears deep. (Well, many people will disagree with me for my opinion on the story.) I hope when I watch the next seasons of this anime, this story will get better.",8,Suwawako_
33486,"
                After absolutely loving and enjoying every bit of season 1 of My Hero Academia I didn't waste any time starting season 2 and just like the first season I loved it just as much. The story just gets even better and compared to season 1 this one is considerably longer and an absolute joy to watch and experience. The characters and arcs sky rocket in this season and is in some cases even better than season 1. Again, I highly recommend this anime to people who have not watched it yet. Its an anime you cant stop watching once you start.

                Season one of My Hero Academia, or Boku no Hero Academia depending on your preference, was a beautiful, charming, but fairly unambitious story-wise example of the shonen genre.  Not the highest of highs, but certainly a strong contender for anyone who's a fan.
Season 2 is where things kick into gear.
We have a tournament arc!  Kind of.  We have far more interesting villains!  We start to plumb the rich psychological backstory of our leads and side characters!  Everything that Season 1 was missing is here, with an even shinier package, featuring some of the most beautiful action scenes I've seen in
                  anime in a hot minute.  I'd favorably compare the sheer quality to FMA: Brotherhood, for one, and I don't make that comparison lightly.
Not to wade too deeply into spoiler territory, but the story punches up hard here.  The Sports Festival Arc is pretty much the moment where I think most fans of the series would agree that MHA Gets Good, hitting a very similar beat to the Chuunin Exam in Naruto in that way.  The cast expands in a big way here, with the likes of Todoroki and Uraraka getting even more heaps of development, and side characters like Tokoyami, Kirishima, and Momo getting time to shine - or not, in fact, in ways that build their development nicely.  And things only speed up from there.  The Hero Killer arc is delightful, as the titular villain, the Hero Killer Stain, is a far more interesting presence and viable threat than anything that's shown up in the series so far, and his repercussions will only build, leading two more fan favorites to debut at the end of the season.
Other than that, it's really more of the same.  The heart and charm is still there, with pretty much every character offering something to like - except a certain grape who will remain nameless - and a surprisingly thorough chance for our side characters in Class 1A to shine all over the place.  There's barley any filler, and what there is carries its weight nicely, with a special episode focusing on everyone's favorite frog girl, Asui.
Now, as with my review of Season 1, it's worth noting that I'm coming to this fully loving superheroes and shonen action both, so if you're not a huge fan of those particularly trope-tastic genres, you might struggle with this.  But there's enough depth to the backstory, enough charm to the personalities, and enough sheer, unadulterated quality to the animation itself that I think most people would find something to like here.",9,jokerdesilva

                This entry in the series takes a conservative route to entertainment that can better be spent watching one-off anime seasons. 
While each progression in the story of My Hero Academia helps us draw nearer to the development of Midoriya and company, this season is very cookie cutter/conservative stuff. I take an interest in other aspects of a story beyond 1v1 fights, so the prestige of this show failed to elevate this stale season. My preference in a superhero show has to do with the action and twists involved rather than small talk and flashy combat, which is my main gripe with it. It never feels
                  like the show is going to veer off the rails and go somewhere unexpected, nor is there a real sense of danger at present. There is plenty of danger, conflict, and tough decisions in My Hero Academia, but very few in this season. This was the only season I had major issues with, whilst I definitely recommend the series as a whole. My advice is to skim this season and focus on the following seasons.",5,TheRockGuy

                SPOILER WARNING:
I consider this the prologue to what will happen in the future as I continued the second season at a later year. The quality of My Hero Academia started to improve here, along with certain parts of the story. From these improvements, the series would also begin to show more character development.
The plot for this season taught me a few things shown in future anime that I watched this year. One example is the tournament arc was one of the best that I've seen now that I have more experience with the anime. Not only did it begin some more character arcs for the
                  rest of the side characters, but it also showed some development in them. The second arc hinted at the somewhat dark nature My Hero Academia has, and I didn't know at the time that it foreshadowed a change MHA will go to in the future. The last arc in the series showed even more character development as well, and from that, it showed how these characters can grow as future heroes.
The story itself continued from where season 1 ended. With extra episodes, it got to show more on how Deku was beginning to go through some character development after he joined UA. With the many tournament arcs, a new villain introduction, and another school exam arc, it mainly focused on how the students will continue to grow as characters. Out of those arcs, the one that stood out the most is the Hero Killer arc. It introduced a unique villain with ideals that hint at the darker part of the society in the anime and I was fascinated to see how it'll unravel.
The characters themselves started to improve as well. Throughout the second season, the side characters started to go through their character arcs, such as the Class 1-A students. This season showed what problems they go through, but with the lessons, they learned along with Deku's influence on some of them, they fleshed out their struggles, but it still wasn't complete. Unless Horikoshi continues their character arc in the future, we've still yet to see how they will expand on them. The villains have also gone through a bit of development after the Hero Killer arc gave them a chance to improve as villains, making their forces more dangerous.
The animation began to improve, especially during the fight scenes. One example of it is the fight between Deku and Todoroki. The animation's quality was so well-done, the visuals were breathtaking, and it began to be like that for future action scenes in this anime. The music itself sounds good, and some were wholesome sounding. The second opening felt like a training montage, while the third ending brought on more action scenes in the later arcs. Both of the ending songs were so wholesome to listen to, but my personal favorite was LiSA's ending. The music also began to improve as its usage in certain scenes was implemented well.
Overall, the second season showed some improvements from the last season. With more action and better quality in animation, this season was one of the more well-liked seasons in the anime. The character development was so good and made me appreciate how great they are, especially the ones that got more attention. From this season, it was the beginning of the events that would occur in the next few seasons.",9,mythical_k

                Boku no Pico Academia. What a blessing we sinful humans have been gifted with. Now I already know that if you haven't seen this anime, your #1 question is ""Is it the next big boi? Like naruto or Bleach or One piiese??"" Well, my simple answer to you is no, because it's WAY BETTER THAN THOSE STUPID WHITE SHOWS!!! Honestly though, it's no major masterpiece, but my god is it entertaining. It's been a LONG time since an anime has kept me this entertained while watching.
I assume that most of you here have seen season 1 of Pico Academia Pizza Piehole. Honestly, it was a
                  pretty good season, but it started off rather slow, and I always felt like ""yeah, this is good, but it's leading up to something greater"".  ANd it was way too short, only being like 13 episodes long. Then, season two was announced, and with the TOURNAMENT AAARRRC being announced, I was under the impression that the entire season would only be that. However, when it was revealed to be a full 25 episode season, I god pretty hypped. However, after seeing a few episodes of season 2, I got super busy and didn't have time to watch it anymore, and eventually forgot about it. During that time though, I heard so much hype over BNHA and just wondered what was up, while still dealing with busyness. However, shit this is getting boring, bottom line is I got sick and finished off season 2 recently. But dear god was it worth it. Season 2 was so good that I literally went back to my anime list and lowered season 1's score because season 2 is so much better!!
The story of course follows midoriia, the typical hero who wants to be the very best like no one ever was. However, he's not. He's my waifu. Anyway, after the villain attack at the end of season 1- 
SEASON 1 SPOILER WARNING
at the end of season 1 after the villain, the U.A. hero festival thing takes place. I had the mentality that this arc would be super boring and a waste of time. BOI WAS I WRONG. The Tournament Arc did something I never thought a tourny arc could do. It ended up being super entertaining while developing the plot and characters at the same time. And some of the fight scenes were so well done, particularly the one between Dikku and flaming cold bby. So amazing, my tears were runing faster than a dil rabbit on a tracter tuff race car racket scriggity sgragett
However, after the end of the festival arc we dive into a more dark story with the introduction of Stain, as well as the return of Facepalm (blue hair man) and his black bartender. WOn't get in to this much, but just gotta say that the 4 or so episodes involving the Hero intern stuff was honestly the highlight of the season for me. I got SO ENGAGED that I proposed to my Telivision Set. It's hard to talk about thiss without spoilers so I'll kinda stahp here. My only major complaint with this part of the season was the filler, and the last episodes weren't as interesting to me as the rest. They were very predictable and just kinda boring, and didn't really move the story anywhere.
The characters, though, were SUCH an improvement compared to season 1. I actually like D00ku now, as he's gone from a little shrimp to a strong willed hero who won't give up on anything. Todoroki was also quite a sexy beast. Before I was like 'eh, he's just the emo boi"" but after seeing his backstory, and watching his growth over the season, I can definetely call him a hunky man. And for the most part, the cast is very likeable and even if not every hero got the development they need, I'm sure more is coming as there's an entire new season coming soon. However, there were 2 rotten apples in the bunch, specifically Bakugo and Grape Juice. grape man is just such a stupid character. He's only there for ""comic relief"", but there's literally nothing funny about him. He's just a perverted little black white kid who's useless in almost every way. And jesus, chill Bakugo. I was hoping maybe he would develop just a little, especially with one of the last episodes, but in the end, he's the same raging carrot cake he was at the beginning of season 1. 
The animation looks really great, quite honestly. Its very fluid and a flashy, unique style that just gives it extra dazzle. The character designs are honestly spectacular, as they really express the characters and distinguish them from your typical realistic cast. The openings and endings are all really catchy, and the OST, while nothing to write home about, never feels out of place. 
I enjoyed the living hell out of this series, and despite some flaws, most of those are personal flaws that I forgive. Overall, I rate this season like an 8.8  out of 10.",9,Emperor_Salad

                Just like the first season, My Hero Academia Season 2 is a fun, exciting and enjoyable show for all ages with some major improvements over its predecessor. 
Art: 9/10
The art is once again great this season with the art style and character designs being retained from before. The numerous fight scenes are all animated consistently well making for some thrilling battles.
Sound: 8/10
The ops, background music and sound effects are also excellent this season. While many of the musical themes return, this is certainly not a bad thing as they all fit the tone well. The two new openings and endings also feature some fantastic tunes
                  (my favourite of which being Peace Sign) which I am sure to be listening to for months to come.
Character: 9/10
This is where My Hero Academia Season 2 excels the most compared to season 1, as many of the characters who were previously ignored now get their own time to shine. Thanks to the longer overall runtime of season 2 the vast majority of characters end up going through some sort of change throughout the season, with Todoroki, Lida, Bakugo and Deku getting the most screen time. Todoroki especially develops a lot after barely being more than a background character in season 1.
Story: 6/10
Unlike the characters, the plot of season 2 is not much of an improvement over season 1. Though the story starts off strong with an invigorating tournament arc (one of the best I've seen), things steadily slow down in the second half of the season as the plot takes a backseat to funny school scenarios, character development and setups for season 3. Even though I still had a good time watching all of this, I would have liked things to have been just a bit more fast paced later on. Additionally, the story remains almost as predictable and straightforward as season 1 which left me cringing at certain moments. Thankfully the constant recapping and flashbacks which were ever present in the first season are almost nonexistent here, giving much more time for new content here.
Enjoyment: 8/10
I greatly enjoyed My Hero Academia Season 2 and was left thoroughly entertained throughout most of my time spent watching. The constant fighting, comedy, action and drama left me completely engaged and engrossed in the show. There were only a few episodes which I didn't particularly like (such as episode 19) but even then I didn't hate what I was watching.
Overall Score: 8/10
As a whole My Hero Academia Season 2 was a clear improvement over the first season with creative characters, motivational music and amazing art. The only area the show really continues to falter in is the story and even that is not straight up bad. In the end I loved this season and am extremely excited to watch more.",8,InfinityDude88

                This season was worse than what I remember, and that is really because of how well I remembered the Roaring Sports Festival arc was. It is not all too great with a rewatch, as it was kind of underwhelming to be honest. The first event, the race, was okay. It was not too thrilling, nothing crazy. Deku had to really think up of some high level strategy to place well in the race. The calavry event was not memorable either, the condition of Deku's team garnering the most amount of points to where every single team would be vying to steal their points was a
                  double-edged sword. It provided an interesting plot idea to where everyone is aiming towards the top, where Deku is at, but I feel the execution of his team trying to evade the other teams trying to do that was...not suspenseful at all. The tournament was pretty lackluster as well since almost every matchup was one-sided. The Deku-Shoto fight was not that great, if you can call that a fight. I kind of feel like it has a Naruto-Neji purpose to it, where it was more of a philosophical battle more than anything.

*SPOILER-FREE*
         If there was a show that could be considered one of the Modern Shounen Greats, that show is “My Hero Academia”. As probably the biggest mainstream hit, other than “Demon Slayer”, it is a manga adaptation with studio Bones in charge of the animation.
	Animation wise, “My Hero Academia” really hit it out of the park, the fights were absolutely amazing, the powers and their interaction with each other and the surroundings was really creative and enjoyable to watch, and the climax moments were as good as one can ask for (also
                  due to the amazing music and soundtracks that really took the fights to the next level). The wide variety of characters and powers with the vivid and bright colours really made it stood out. The world was well designed as were the backgrounds and places throughout the seasons.
	However, despite the amazing characters and animation, “My Hero Academia” ends up falling in a lot of tropes and stereotypes that make it lose that sense of uniqueness that other shows might have. The plot is good, especially the anti-hero ‘Stain’ arc but in many other moments and plot points it was pretty much a power of friendship, good defeats evil kind of narrative, which I’m not saying it is bad, since it appeals to a very big audience, but not my type of tea.
	Overall, “My Hero Academia” is an amazing show and what a true Shounen is at his best, it does not have the best written story or characters, but it makes up for that in awesome action scenes and fights.",7,ICenturyI

Story is still evolving and this is getting closer you to the show. Arts are evolved especially on Festival arc. Sounds still stay perfect. BUT, but, one character (it's two at the beginning i should say but one of them did a thing at the season camp arc at season 3 which i can be okay with that laser belt boy.) pulling down show to the ground(1). So do you enjoy, if you do bingewatch or not first two season? My answer is still yes. Do not miss the
                  good taste of shonen show. So overall (+/-)
PROS:
• Flashbacks are became lesser.
• MC is has great scenes and missions.
• Most character learn so much things about their quirks.
• Fight scenes, so good. Especially on Festival, ep 10.
CONS:
• The beginning of the Festival Arc feels me like it's filler but it's not, thanks.
• (1)Minoru Mineta. If anyone get me a wish, i'll delete this character's existence. If i start to telling my OWN OPINIONS of this character, This review will deleted by mods i guess.

                This anime is one of the shonen anime that is quite liked by many people including me
Synopsis :
Tells about Midoriya Izuku's journey to become a number one hero like his idol All Might but unfortunately he doesn't have a quirk / special ability when almost the entire human population in the world has it
The reasons I like My Hero Academia are:
1) First, the story uses the concept from zero to hero which if you like Naruto maybe you will like this anime
2) I enjoy the process of developing Deku (Izuku Midoriya) we can see how difficult Deku struggles to become a great hero and the
                  dynamics of his competition with other students we see him grow, break, fall, break, break, break, fall, get back up and attracts us to support him not because he's the main character but because he really deserves it
3) The characters are diverse and very well developed, all characters have strong characterizations with varied personalities with unique quirks. The development of each character is given a balanced portion, whether it's the protagonist or antagonist. hero as they want to achieve their respective goals and as Deku's story is told to become Hero No. 1
4) Finally, the battles are presented in an epic manner, so far there has been no battle that looks boring for me, good animation makes every battle look amazing",8,Fuegel

The 2nd season is Draggggggeed out way too much on the whole arena part, like way too much i will say i did enjoy seeing the fighting and the different types of powers but after the arena, the ending was rushed too which i did not like.
I just wish that the ending had 
                  abit more time put into it, like it could of been rounded up abit better then it did but like i said, i still enjoyed..

                I was introduced to this series by a friend, I barely knew anything about this anime and gave it a try. The first season was something I could watch and genuinely enjoy myself at the moment. The second season I found to be the same as the first season, the story is unique and paired with high-quality animation that makes the fights just as intense as the first season. As a high school student, I find the characters truly relatable in the sense of a school setting. This season was just something fun to watch.

                My Hero Academia - Season 2 (Review):
As I'm writing this, I am 11 episodes into season 3 which is getting insanely good by the way, so I'll try not to confuse between the seasons and keep this strictly about season 2 only.
My Hero Academia season 2 is very similar to its predecessor in many ways but I also believe that it took a lot of the elements that season 1 introduced and built, expanded and improved upon them ever so slightly. While the first season is a 7.66/10, I think that this second season has improved itself to a 8.33/10, by the looks of things
                  season 3 is improving even further.
This season appears to be split into 3 distinct sections. The first is the U.A. Sports Festival Arc, then the Vs. Hero Killer Arc and finally the Final Exams Arc. The three arcs present here are more apparent than before and you can definitely tell when each arc switches to the next because of tonal shifts, dramatic change in the main plot and in locations. Now these aren't inherently bad things but I would've preferred if the anime could've taken its time a little more to shift a little more naturally between the arc rather than an instant move from arc to arc, it's not terrible but it can be a little jarring at times, especially since when I look back on it now, I can distinctly split this season up into 3 in my head because of the very apparent tonal shifts. It's not an anime but the complete polar opposite of this would be in Better Call Saul, the different storylines and shifts from plot to plot across multiple seasons is so seamless that I can only look back on that show as one continuous running story rather than distinct different plotlines. Now I guess it depends on preference but personally, I think it's more impressive when a show can naturally shift through different tones and storylines without the audience noticing, it makes for a more realistic and immersive experience I feel, whereas when shows shift instantly between arcs, it gives me very obvious places to stop and call it a night, compared to seamless shifts where I literally can't stop watching because of how immersive the ongoing storyline is and since it gives me no obvious place to stop. This isn't a massive fault for My Hero Academia season 2 since most anime do this exact same thing but I just thought it was worth mentioning here since it was extremely apparent, I'm not going to deduct too much from the show since it's not exactly objectively bad, it's just based on personal preference.
Since this season is so obviously split up, I may as well talk about each arc individually and talk about what I liked.
U.A. Sports Festival Arc:
This is an arc that most shonen anime step into at one point or another, the tournament arc. I'm not gonna give My Hero any points for just doing a tournament arc since it's a shonen trope at this point. What I am going to give it points for is doing it a little differently. There's 3 different setups throughout the arc, the race in the beginning which is pretty short and wasn't really good enough to mention, the team battle where each team has to stay together to collect points form headbands and the 1v1 battles which were for sure the highlight of the arc. What I liked most about the arc is that instead of focusing on just making a tournament arc without much substance, it takes time to establish characters' personalities, backgrounds and values which also taking a little time to develop a few of them too. This is the arc where I actually began to learn everyone's names and saw them as more than just side characters because the anime actually took some time to pair Deku up with people other than Iida and Uraraka. It characterises each of them very well and gives them all distinct personalities and takes some time to show off their strengths and weaknesses, showing why the ones who lose, lose and why the ones who win, win.
What I liked most about this arc is that Midoriya loses his fight against Todoroki. It not only gives us a chance to see Shoto's true power once he releases his left side, but it also shows us that Izuku has a long way to go and that he's being held back, at the moment, he's still weak. The arc also gives us Shoto's backstory and he becomes one of the best characters in the show alongside Bakugo. What's funny is that the side characters in My Hero Academia seem to be much more well developed that Deku himself, they even say it  outright that his reasons for being a hero and wanting to be the best are trivial compared to Shoto.  The arc basically ends there but it does a great job at showing us how far Midoriya actually has to go while actually giving us time to know and grow to like the side characters in the show. Season 2 begins with a strong beginning arc and it already shows promise that it'll surpass the first season.
Vs. Hero Killer Arc:
I think this second arc in the season is my favourite, it does go back to focusing on Midoriya a little more but also gives us a little more development for Iida with the Hero Killer: Stain ruining his brother's career by crippling him. It's the first time the anime really gives itself a chance to be darker in tone with the introduction of the Hero Killer, who immediately became one of my favourite characters, even with his extreme outlook on heroes, he still stick to his beliefs and even opposes the league of villains and indirectly opposes All for One. It's a little shorter than the tournament arc but I think it also does so much better for Midoriya's development and training to becoming a hero. It also expands more on the rules of the world of heroes and you do actually empathise with Stain's view of the monopolization of it all, even if his methods of changing it are a little too extreme. I like the introduction of Gran Torino and his training of Deku is one of the best parts of the arc. The only thing I didn't like here is that the U.A. students beat Stain in battle, the hero killer who's murdered and crippled tons of pro heroes is defeated by a few heroes in training? I don't know, I just don't buy it completely. If they wanted him captured, they should've just had them wear him out and have Midoriya's distress call end up attracting pro heroes to the scene. As for the rules against injuring people with quirks, it was only really self defense against Stain but I guess that's a minor complaint. Other than that, the Vs. Hero Killer Arc was great, probably my favourite of the season with its darker tones, showing the unfair, cruel and more violent side to being a hero while also giving both Iida and Midoriya great development for their characters.
Final Exams Arc:
I think this is my least favourite arc of the season, it's not bad at all, I'd even say it's pretty great. But it kind of feels like a watered down version of the first arc from this season. It treads over similar ground and basically just continues with the expansion of side characters, which I actually love! It just feels a hell of a lot less memorable than the last. Thinking back on it, my favourite part of the arc was how they made Midoriya and Bakugo work together to face All Might for the exam. With All Might getting weaker, having the weights on and most likely holding back, it seemed somewhat believable that they beat him and it was nice to see them get some relationship development, even if it was just a little. I also liked that they made all of Class A confront their weaknesses by either working with the least compatible classmate or going up against the hardest teacher for them to deal with based off of their quirks and abilities. I thought it was a smart was to develop the characters and train them to work together while also expanding on them as people and their relationships with one another. It's a very solid arc, it's just a lot shorter and less memorable really, it's still great though.
Overall, My Hero Academia season 2 builds and expands upon the groundwork that th first season lay down in excellent ways. It eases the show into a slightly darker tone with the Hero Killer Arc whilst simultaneously setting up the future of the League of Villains and Tomura's development as the main antagonist of the show. The season gives great development, not only for Midoriya, but also for the majority of the side characters, using a mix and match technique, pitting characters together and against each other in order to get us used to them in a natural and fluid way. My favourite parts of the season were Midoriya and Shoto's ight, the battle against Stain (even if they did win a little too easily) and Bakugo & Midoriya v All Might. I feel they had the most impact on the story and characters as a whole. I liked its setup for future arcs and seasons as well as a slow gradual shift into a darker tone, even if the shifts between arcs were a little jarring here. Overall, it's an improvement over the first, showing off more characters, developing them in interesting and natural ways as well as giving us intriguing plotlines and arcs to work with, making season 2 ever so slightly more original than the first and upping My Hero Academia's quality as a whole. I'm hoping S3 continues this increase in quality because I'm genuinely liking where this is going, by the looks of what I've seen so far, it's doing just that, with S03E11 being my favourite in the show so far. Good improvements all around here!

                I have enjoyed this whole series and have only considered writing a review now. I think it was this season, back when I first watched bnha in 2018, that made me really fall in love with the show. Though that may be in part because I definitely have a soft spot for Todoroki, I think this segment of the show was really, really fantastic. 
I think what pulls the second season together are the characters--for the first time, we get to see some of Deku's steel, which we only had vague flashes of in season 1. The cavalry battles showcase growth, friendship, different layers to
                  the strength of the characters. The introduction of certain characters who will later play significant roles in the show. 
I also think this arc really relies on one of the core elements of the show--competitiveness. This is a high stakes world, one in which you have huge numbers of heroes, who are supposed to be working together, instead fighting for a title. I think balancing that with the genuine kindness, altruism, and goodness of the class 1-A is a really big part of the success of this season.

                My Hero Academia is the kind of anime that gets better and takes volume, if you liked the first season, you will love the second one!
This session starts with the high school championship and is simply excellent. The tests highlight the creativity of the author (and of the characters), the students of the class are presented whereas before it was only simple extras. If one can hardly speak of character evolution at this stage, the characters are well written and their adventures pleasant to follow. Little mention in combat Izuku VS Shoto who totally reminded me of a Naruto VS Neji, tell me I’m not
                  the only one please.
We also check the ultra classic thing in the nekketsu: the championship, that’s it.
With the second bow, we are on something heavier, glaucous and visceral enough fight with Stain, the plot advances to forced march; then we have a few less intense episodes that allow us to catch our breath, to continue brushing the characters.
One remark: one aspect that I find very good is the absence of «hard core»: characters that become more and more secondary as one moves away from the hero. In the case of the class, everyone is entitled to a fairly qualitative treatment, and people mix quite a bit, everyone has a decent airtime.
In terms of animation, I find this season better than the first, full of good ideas. The work on the eyes gives a lot of cachet to the venerable characters, and the animation is fluid and pleasant.",9,Heymateur

(Story)
This season of this show was basically about Deku gaining control of his power. In this season the students at UA took tests, learned more about their quirks and took internships. Deku ends up meeting All Might's teacher which was special to him. While he is being interned he runs into the Hero Killer, a villian in the franchise that kills fake hero's. Honestly there was a lot that happened in this season and I don't want to type every single detail even though I am tempted to. The story never left me wondering and was overall really good, there was never a
                  dull moment. This is why (in my opinion) I gave the story a 9/10.
(Characters)
In some ways the characters changed from season 1 to season 2, which is expected. With that being said my opinion on my ""favorite characters"" have changed. My favorite male character i still Todoroki but Deku is a character that i've taken a liking to now. I think this is because he has shown progression in controlling his power. My favorite female character is Uraraka. Their really isn't any specific reason why she is my favorite from this season but no other female character stood out to me. Plus when she realizes she may like Deku its adorable. This is why (in my opinion) I gave the characters a 8/10
(Enjoyment)
It took me a while to finish this season because I have school and other stuff going on but I really liked this show. Especially since Deku is now showing progression. I'm also glad that Toga appeared. None the less this show is great to me and I like everything about it personally. This is why I gave my personal enjoyment a 10/10.",10,mar-senpai

                Story [10] - The story continued to show how Deku and his classmates develop into better heros and personas. It was also nice to see into the other classmates developments as well, I enjoyed seeing everyone developed. It was rather interesting, to see people who I thought to be well layed out, to have their own situations. It was a nice wake up call that this anime is not like the others. I enjoyed how it ended and will most likely pick up in the next season. 
Art [8] - Very lovely art. It fits in well with the story and plot. I enjoyed watching
                  and wasn't cringing like other certain animes. There were some funny animations that made me chuckle in real life. 
Sound [9] - I enjoyed the sound(?). When it says sound I assume OST and such. The two beginning OST were beautiful. I especially enjoyed the later one. The foreshadowing of the heros past reflecting their current actions was a well nice planned. I enjoy development in any shows I watch. And seeing it in an anime is always pleasant to watch. 
Character [10] - Enjoyed seeing the development of ALL the characters was amazing. Loved it. 
Enjoyment [9] - I enjoyed it a lot. Lots of scenes which made me hold my breath, laugh, gasp, and even ponder along side the characters. 
Overall [9.2] - Enjoyed it and would recommend to all.",9,ItsAngelAri

                MHA season 2 was just as good as season one possibly even better. The fight scenes in this season actually gave me goose bumps and made me feel emotion (which is very rare for me). There are few shows that can actually make me feel hyped and excited to continue watching. The music in MHA is something else it can make any scene 20x more exciting. There was also more character development for some characters which is always good. This season was very action packed and there were also some drama which was unexpected. I would recommend MHA after watching this season :))

                the story itself isn't bad however i hope the characters get better, and quickly or i don't think i can watch much more. izuku midoriya and katsuki bakugo are just unbearable to watch. izuku cries every ten minutes, and bakugo seems like he was put there just to bully everyone especially izuku. this show would have been a lot better had it been in another characters point of view. other then the terrible main characters this show isn't bad, i actually really like the sports festival story line, it reminds me a lot of the grand magic games story line in fairy tail.

Well, definitly this season is way enjoyable than the first one. The story and the development of the characters is what makes you watch the next episode, and then the next one til the end. In this season we could watch an amazing development with every character evento though they aren't mains btw. 
What makes me sad is that Bakugo has a freaking negative personality and quite forgetable to me and the I realized that because of him I started unliking Midoryia cause of his humilitation moments for Baguko, I mean... meh! 
Anyaways, it's a good season and a good
                  way to continue the role story. I'm hoping to see more fights like in this second season, they were lit!

                Everything About The Anime Was Amazing. Fight Seen Specially Midoria VS Todoroki 
Is One Of My Favorite Fight Seen. The Animation And Soundtracks Were Also Amazing. 
If I Talk About Character Development, So The Creators Mainly Focused On The Main Character, As Well As The Other Sportive Characters Also, Were In The First Season They Mainly Focused On The Main Characters Development.         
The Soundtracks Were Really So Epic Spcially ""You Can Say Run"" Was Amazing. Both The Story And The Animation Were Outstanding.
If You Like Attack On Titan, God Of High School Type Anime For Their Epic
                  Fight Seen So You Definitely Should Watch This Anime.
If I Talk About The Theme Songs, So The First Opening And The 2nd Ending Songs Were My Favourites.
Overall The Anime Was So Enjoyable. It Made My Lockdown Without Any Doubts.",10,iloveanime404

                OH BOY. I could talk about this show for hours on end. While the first season was good don't get me wrong it was a little too campy sometimes. I understand that the idea of the story is taking all the best parts of most shounen anime and polish them till they shine the brightest the first season didn't do it for me the same way this season did. After watching the Todoroki/Deku fight I ended up binging the entire manga before next weeks episode came out. This was something I've never done with an anime. This story resonated incredibly hard when I watched that
                  fight and is probably something I will always remember. The thing that resonated with me was that this story asked a question. One simple tiny question: What does being a hero mean to you? 
This isn't something that one protagonist can tackle on their own as heroism means something different for every unique person and the show is using it's giant cast to provide story lines and personality tied answers to that question. It's this mixing pot of ideals and characters providing the answers to this question. Due to the nature of having a large cast of characters conflict is bound to happen either between the aspiring heroes of UA or when villains shows up or especially  when Stain showed up. That's the thing about this show, even the villains have their own answer to that question. Hell I would even go far enough to say that even the antagonists of the show aren't that morally wrong.
I won't touch on the Leagues motives because at this point in the anime that point hasn't been explored yet and I wouldn't want to spoil that. Their means don't really justify the ends but the ends are something that I can't fault them for. Being brought up in a society filled with heroes chasing the almighty (heh) dollar and losing their way as it were, was the reason stain formed his ideals. He hated seeing selfish heroes only looking out for their own well being because a hero to him was someone who put others far above their own. So what does Stain do? He goes around killing heroes that go against his personal ideals of society. Again can't agree with the means of his ideas cause ya know, murdering is bad but that's his way of cleansing the stains on society (hmm I wonder why his name is Stain :thinking: ?). That's the most important point of the show. Each character has their answer to the question and pursues them to the best of the abilities given to them.
Characters with strong reasons for the actions they take are always bound to clash with someone who has a difference of opinion. Every single fight this season has this underlying narrative of how these two ideas go against each other. If I'm being honest, from a choreographically standpoint the fights are relatively bland. Hell, Naruto has more complicated fight choreography the MHA, but the complexity of the fights doesn't matter. The focal point of the fights in HeroAca is showcasing the ideals of each fighter and how they react to them. MHA at this point has shown it's true colors at this point in the show, its a character drama using the guise of its flashy fights to be a shounen. When Midoriya fights off against Todoroki the fight and the show up to that point was purely about the fight. But the show uses subversion of the tropes it employs in great effect mind you, to change the tone of the fight and the series going forward to be about how these characters express themselves in the hero society. 
The other thing this show subverts it tropes is how it handles an age old technique of the mid battle power up. The way My Hero handles this is by having the characters tackle a mental block on their power or gaining a deeper understanding of how their quirk actually functions (this being explained a bit in season one but exploring that more in this season). Why shounens use this trope is probably to keep the action fresher by introducing new things the characters can do in the fights, gives your eyes something newer to look at. The execution of this trope is one of the coolest things it does to further push the idea that the show is not really about the really cool looking fight sequences and is primarily about the characters.
Departing from the deep dive I took to explain the highlight fight of the season the other facets of the show got massive developments. More of the classmates and other side characters got a ton of developement, Uraraka and Lida being the highlights but even some of the more minor characters got their time in the spotlight, Yaoyorozu being one of my favorites of the season.
My Hero Academia can be surface level for some and enjoyment can be had but below the surface of the show lies one of my favorite character dramas I have had the joy to experience. This series has become my all time favorite anime and I'm curious to see if something else is capable of taking it off that spot. I mean Gurren Lagann was solidly at that spot for the better part of 5 years for me thinking it was unbeatable. But with only 1 episode showing off so god damn much to show its true hand and completely blind siding me with something special. It's a deceptively simple show that knows its strength and will always put it's best foot forward and im always grateful for taking the dive into it.",10,Rulerofpie

                I'm not typically a fan of shounen genre anime, but Boku no Hero Academia has definitely been the exception. After missing the hype train on it when it was first released, and watching it late, I was unsure why everyone was so excited, now I know why.
Story: The story for BnHA is a very touching tale, and to avoid getting into too spoiler heavy territory for those who have not seen either of the seasons, it is a tale that everyone can relate to in some way. It is told very well in it's 25 episodes and never once did I feel like the story
                  was dragging, or find any obvious (or really any) plot holes, or Deus Ex Machinas. 10/10.
Art: I am not the best judge of art, but from the animation quality and the details and effort that went into the visuals in every scene, I must say that it was definitely a wonderful anime to watch. 9/10.
Sound: I unfortunately, am not the best judge of OST, but BnHA is an exception. I really enjoyed both of the OPs for this season, and can say that these have been two of the few OPs that I never skip. The EDs were just as good, and gave a nice amount of time to reflect on the events of the episode before the next preview. I also enjoyed the epicness of the background soundtrack, including the main theme of BnHA. 9/10.
Character: The character development in this season was phenomenal. Many characters that may have seemed shallow or cliche in the last season were fully fleshed out, and viewers were given a much more in-depth knowledge of their motivations, feelings and dreams. This season provided many interesting ""side characters"" their own time to shine in the limelight and it never once felt like it could have been filler, or out of place like it can in other anime. 10/10.
Enjoyment: I believe that you will be hard-pressed to find a more beloved anime in recent years. Especially from what has been heralded by many as ""the best shounen of all time"". 10/10.
Overall: Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed BnHA S2, even more-so than season 1, as it expanded brilliantly on the concept. If I looked very hard, I could probably find faults in it, but I do not want to. This specific anime is getting a 10/10 from me, for the same reason all of the others I rated have. It was able to resonate with something inside of me as a viewer, without too many issues in other categories. This anime was a joy to watch and I can't wait for S3. 10/10.",10,Springball64

                This season, in general, surpasses all aspects of the previous one. As for animation, having more chapters, it shines more, but it shows that the quality has increased. The soundtrack is amazing, as you would expect from Yuki Hayashi. If you have seen the first season, I strongly advise you to watch this second, because for many it is the peak of the series in terms of quality (although this is subjective). The story evolves a lot this season, and although the world does not develop much, unlike in other seasons, the story of different characters will develop a lot, which although they may be
                  somewhat secondary (Tenya) are quite entertaining and enjoyable at the end of the day.",9,ruferson

                Boku no hero academia 2nd season: *may contain minor spoilers*
Okay... I am so happy about this season. It is such a stepup from the first season. The first season only had 12 episodes when this season has double episodes. The animation aswell is like 3 times as better; I don't want to spoil it but the fights in this season are so good especially the main fight (if you know you know). The story as a whole was a lot more clear this season as it focused on just one topic. Also, I love how this season it went into detail for other characters backstories.
Overall:
                  This is definately worth a watch and is a massive improvement to the first season.",7,DylanPalmer
