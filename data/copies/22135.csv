                Ping Pong The Animation is an exceptional show. This is less of a sports anime and more of a powerful emotions series. It's a beautifully crafted coming of age story and one that certainly doesn't come along often. In a word, it's unconventional. Nothing about Ping Pong feels ordinary so love it or hate it, it's hard to not recognize its artistic merit. 
The story is a simple one and it chronicles the lives of two boys and their experiences with table tennis. We're introduced to Makoto Tsukimoto, aptly nicknamed ""Smile"", and his boastful best friend Yutaka Hoshino, or ""Peco"". These two are polar opposites
                  and we follow them through their high school ping pong careers. Their story is told in just 11 episodes and it's nothing short of pacing perfection. Everything meshes wonderfully from start to finish and each episode provides just the right amount of information without overwhelming or confusing the viewer. Ping Pong is great at giving you important plot points piece by piece and this makes it an incredibly engaging experience. Each episode is satisfying and this makes it very tempting to marathon. 
This is where things start to get shaky for the average anime viewer. The art style is simple and misshapen. There are no enormous and colorful eyes. The lines are crude and uneven so things like ping pong balls aren't perfect circles. It'd be no exaggeration to say this is some of the most unorthodox art in the industry today, but by no means is it bad. It may be out of the comfort zone, but it's fitting for what the show is trying to do and it has an inexplicable charm to it. The animation is quite weak at times and things just look sloppy. This actually works to the show's advantage by providing a unique style of its own. The art and animation stay consistent the whole way through. If this bothers you, get out while you still can.
It's hard to believe a show about ping pong has music as good as this. The sound sets the mood perfectly. From simple melodic tunes while training to the adrenaline pumping opening song, Ping Pong knows just the right track to play at every given moment. A handful of tracks feel a bit out of place, but as a whole, it feels like watching one long movie. Additionally, the music is very good at distorting one's perception of time. There are times where it goes completely silent to emphasize the strain on a character. You may even associate certain songs with certain characters and this is a very good thing because it means you're connecting with them. 
Where Ping Pong really shines is its characters. The amount of development in such a short time is staggering. The interactions between characters are astoundingly genuine; every conversation feels natural. There's meaningful growth in even the most unlikely people and this is a breath of fresh air from shows where nothing seems to change. 
I don't want to go into too much detail regarding individuals, but the rivalries between characters are beautifully illustrated. Their personalities bounce off of each other in a frighteningly realistic way. The harsh reality of athletics is painted not only on their faces, but also on their words. A lot of conversations later on are poignant and almost poetic. It's tragic at times and these interactions do a great job of maintaining the morbid realism that made the early episodes special. 
Ping Pong is not a light watch. This is something that can be enjoyed by anyone who wants a good story. You don't have to like or even understand table tennis, it's first and foremost a tale about growing up. It's undoubtedly a memorable experience and something very much worth your time if you keep an open mind.",9,Volunteer

""Do that, and I'll come to you!""
From time to time, a show will be despised by some for the unorthodox and uncommon mediums of presentation and execution. I hold the notion that Ping Pong The Animation truly uses its unorthodox way with great triumph and success. 
Ping Pong The Animation is set in a local Japanese town and portrays the lives of two young boys in the local table-tennis club. Having an innate talent for the sport, Makoto Tsukimoto, nicknamed Smile, and his close friend Yukata Hoshino, nicknamed Peco, are depicted
                  as two ordinary Japanese males with hidden latent potential in the sport they play derived from their distinct and individual traits and personality. Both these characters have their own unique play style differing from another and is manifested clearly throughout the course of the show, whether they be panels popping up on the screen in sync with the sounds of the ping pong balls colliding with the table or the motion of their movements in matches. 
Both Smile and Peco have their own memorable characteristics and qualities. Smile is shown invariably depressed and has no interest in the sport itself whether it be for competitive of leisure play. Instead, his raison d'Ãªtre for being in the club is to merely kill time in his depicted pathetic life. Be it the monologues of Smile to the stoic and emotionless quality of his, he is still shown as a likable character with genuine qualities. Despite hiding away his emotions, it is made evident towards the audience that he does in reality portray a sense of morality and his own set of beliefs and attitudes especially during and after the match against Wenge Kong, an extremely skilled foreign table-tennis player from China recently abandoned by his home team in China. Nicknamed China himself, Kong is another unique member of the cast in Ping Pong The Animation as it gives a national sense of diversity towards our main Japanese cast. Not only this, but we are also able to have an insight of players from foreign countries besides Japan as well as their individual used play styles and capabilities. Despite coming from China, the country where table tennis plays a fundamental role as one of the country's highly-acclaimed sports, Kong is not displayed as the archetype of overpowered-ness. Instead he is more or less portrayed as a tragic hero, as he comes to learn that there are many other great and exceptional players throughout the world and this adds on to his development as a character. Peco dreams to be a champion in the sport and is portrayed as an arrogant and talented player, as well as the epitome of liveliness as he is constantly engaged and is energetic in the sport he loves. He is almost portrayed as the antithesis foil of Smile as unlike Smile, Peco has a true passion towards table-tennis and tries his best. Other supporting characters worthy of mention would be the coach who constantly supports and drives Smile to play to his best knowing that he has a growing innate and hidden talent for table-tennis and will not realise it until he conquers some of his prime weaknesses, holding back against opponents and hindering the definition of true sportsmanship.Not only do these characters amaze me, but so do the support characters. Obaba, or the Tamura Lady is Peco's sensei from the table-tennis hall. As Peco repents and changes as a person who wants to regain his dream of becoming a ping-pong champion, both of them develop their relationships too and more memorably by the line of ""love ya"" till the point even Peco says it to Kazuma, also known as Dragon. 
Dragon, or Kazama is a well-known champion and paradigm of hard work and strength throughout the show. Represented by the mythical specie Dragon, Kazama portrays strong intellect and hard work with extreme effort devoted into table-tennis. Despite all of this has contributed into his overall power and making him stand as number one, he does not understand one thing about table-tennis. That one thing is having fun or just enjoyment in general, and because of this, he does not have the potential Peco has to become everything he wants to or can be. 
Akuma is another great side character who has underwent extreme change. After always tailing behind Peco in their childhood table-tennis life, Akuma finally regains more of what he wanted to be when he played against Peco. He acts as a symbol for hard work, while Peco at first is a symbol of talent, until Peco also attains hard work and having fun in the latter half of the anime as he understands that they are necessary components for success. KAs the anime progresses, all the characters, Smile, Peco, Kong, Kazama, and Akuma undergo heavy amounts of character development and mature as human beings, changing the way they act as well as their mindsets and just shows how much ping-pong as a sport can bring to anyone. 
Now regarding the art and animation, this is where critics place there hands on. Arguably having low budget visuals, many don't know that the manga's art is similar in its own essence and that the adaptation is attempting to be faithful to its source material. Taking this into consideration, the visuals can be seen as amazingly stunning and captivating to say the least. I think that this artwork is what brings the best execution from the show itself and using other high-budget and more modern and common forms of artwork would not bring out the same excellent effects this unique art offers. Backgrounds are detailed and facial expressions are clear most of the time. Specific camera angles and pop-up frames are used to their best extent during matches and the pop-up frames in sync with the music and the bounces of the balls all amalgamate to show synergy in its execution. This realistic approach from the art is what truly makes Ping Pong The Animation such a great success thus far. Getting used to the artwork is in fact not difficult at all, a few episodes and I'm almost entirely  sure one can get used to it and understand its intrinsic beauty. 
The sound in the show is the paradigm of excellence. The opening song itself sets the stage for the incoming episode and circulates adrenaline around the viewer's body, wanting the music to last forever. The ending song closes each episode well, and leaves the watchers ready for the incoming previews as well as setting the scene by showing visuals of the town itself. The ost is phenomenal, it utilizes the rock genre to its pinnacle especially during the matches. Likewise, the ost also manages to regularly captivate the audience by matching with the animation during the games. Regarding the voice acting, a worthy mention is definitely Kong, or more known as China. The foreign voice actor is an aspect that also contributes into making China such a remarkable character as not only is it realistic, but not many anime you see nowadays utilize voice acting to the point where foreign voice actors are hired for the job. As the story progresses Peco's voice becomes a great voice to just hear into your ears. His enthusiasm and motivation and even his raison d'Ãªtre is shown by his vehement voice actor and I am well sure that Peco and Smile's persona would be different without the utilisation of the same voice actors. Smile's voice does not change as the story progresses, but his tone does as he changes as a person. 
Ping Pong The Animation is definitely worth the watch as I enjoyed every minute of the show. The show utilizes innovative and unorthodox mediums and amalgamates the visuals, the sound, the story, as well as characters to their zenith. Give yourself the opportunity to engross yourself into the successful show Ping Pong The Animation is of today.
There's nothing to lose and regret for watching it, but by not watching it, you lose the experience to touch upon this intriguing and exquisite show. 
Ping Pong The Animation has taught me many prominent values in life. Hard work....talent....and having fun.....these three constituents are all important ingredients that some people will always have more than others and no one can become the best player out there in the world with merely heavy amounts of hard work but having no fun at all. If you want to do well in something, you have to enjoy it. Don't envy those who significantly have more talent and power in them, strive for that power yourself by hard work and effort. But most importantly, remember to have fun and enjoy the time you spend in the sport.",10,LeFlower-kun

                It's a rarity nowadays to find many series or studios willing to take risks. Much of the anime industry has taken to fan-service oriented pandering and it's left me craving for something new. Something that can blow me away with it's creativity and unorthodox presentation. Utilizing its unconventional style, fantastic character development, symbolism, and occasional moments of witty dry humor, Ping Pong The Animation is that something.
When I first started this series I had low expectations. How could a series about ping pong be any good? It seemed like the flop of the season. Fortunately, I have never been so wrong. Despite its appearances of
                  being a simplistic show about playing table tennis, Ping Pong had a surprising amount of depth. Like any other sports anime, the series focuses on pushing the story forward by using the game as it's major plot device. However, unlike many other sports anime, Ping Pong takes a more believable, realistic style. There is no feeling of unrealistic, over-the-top antics like you might see in Prince of Tennis, nor is there an unbeatable Gary Stu like you'd see in One Outs. Ping Pong is simple, yet complicated. Messy, yet also clean. Realistic, yet unbelievable, all at the same time. 
Another thing the series does well is keeping the audience interested in the strategies, style, and skill that ping pong requires as a sport without seeming boring or tedious. In this series the games themselves also aren't simply just games. Each game portrays something akin to a soliloquy or inner monologue for at least one character. It props the characters up and pours color into their black and white hand-drawn cutouts. If you can feel the inner turmoil, anguish, happiness, and sadness just by watching two people hit a ball back and forth across a net on a small table, then you know you've watched something special. 
Of the few reasons people may dislike this series, the art and animation style will likely be the one. Ping Pong has a sort of rotoscope, flip-book type of style. At times it looks like a sketch or unfinished work, but it works so well for this series in particular. It's strange, but also charmingly unique. The games of table tennis seem so fluid and realistic that it sometimes feels like I might be watching people playing the game live right in front of me. It feels like a perfect match. 
Ping Pong delivers on the sound criteria just like any other. The beginning of the series didn't feel quite complete since it was missing its real opening, but the timing and placement of each sound felt spot on. It's easy to tell that the attention to detail is there. The opening will get you hyped for the episode and the ending will simmer you down. They compliment each other very well. The soundtrack, overall, is great.
The two main characters of the series are Tsukimoto, ""Smile"" Makoto and Hoshino, ""Peco"" Yutaka. Despite being polar opposites, these two characters mesh together other with ease. Smile takes the role of the passive, quiet, and soft-spoken character, versus Peco, the energetic, loud, and cocky personality. They act as yin and yang in the series. While the main story is about these two, their friendship, rivalry, and camaraderie, it also takes the time to give the supporting characters their turn in the spotlight. All characters, whether it be the main or supporting, are dynamic and, as the series progresses, grow based on their experiences. Characters who come to realize their faults, and begin to instigate change to better themselves, are a rare occurrence in anime, yet Ping Pong is no stranger to utilizing the unordinary and implementing it with finesse.
Although Ping Pong The Animation may be a more serious, somber sports series, it's easily a worthwhile watch for any audience. It's a shame that Ping Pong didn't quite get the attention it deserves. Despite being one of the most under-appreciated series from the Spring '14 season, it was truly a diamond in the rough. If you give it a bit of your time and a little polish I guarantee that it'll shine for you as it did for me.",9,Satire

                I recently reviewed something and gave it praise for the narrative it was able to achieve in 13 episodes. I canât help but share that sentiment in regards to what Ping Pong is able to accomplish with its 11 episodes. A transformation story from angsty adolescence to enlightened and matured adults, Ping Pong goes well and truly beyond the generic confines of the sports genre illustrating a beautiful narrative of complex emotional growth and maturation, truly cementing its place as a modern classic. 
It wouldnât be a stretch to call Masaaki Yuasa a genius. Those who have been exposed to his past works will understand
                  that his left wing approach goes completely against the grain and standard expectations of animation by today's standard. Combined with the fact that his works are highly intelligent, often profound and filled with a philosophical depth Yuasa earns his place at the pinnacle of the industry. And here he is again. After Mind Game. After Tatami Galaxy. Yuasa has returned bellowing from above, telling us once again that life is simply worth living. That despite anything that happens in one's life, there is always a reason to push on. That in and of itself, is what Ping Pong is truly about. Living. Living life to its fullest, enjoying every twist and turn it brings. 
âWeâre alive, thatâs why weâre happy!â
Understanding that, its no surprise that the characters, above all else, make Ping Pong truly special. They are the driving force of the series. Genuine, believable and one way or another it is likely for their emotions and struggles to resonate with the viewer. These characterâs are not perfect, they are flawed, burdened and they struggle. The hero of the story - Peco - is so full of hot air and arrogance at the beginning that once he is brutally beaten by someone worlds ahead of him, and by someone he once thought was beneath him, he falters and loses hope almost giving up on the sport he has loved his entire life. Yet it is his inevitable acceptance and reinvention of himself that results in not only his transformation to maturity, but also the transformations of those he meets along the way. 
Similarly, Kong Wenge finds himself in a comparable position, being ostracized from the national Chinese team, he finds himself in egotistical ignorance like Peco, thinking he is above everyone else. It is only through his acceptance after playing with Peco that Kong evolves and is truly able to succeed. Kazama sacrifices everything in an attempt to maintain his family and clubâs status. Ping Pong is simply a means to an end for Kazama. Through his match with Peco, he finally learns to let go of his burdens, to play for himself, no longer seeing the sport as a mandatory duty. Through exposure to the hero Kazama also transforms not only being able to enjoy the sport for what it is, but also his life. Yet no transformation is more rewarding or majestic than Smileâs. Peco finally breaks Smileâs robot shell in their final match and for the first time since he was a child, he smiles. 
Its understandable that the art deters individuals. By no means will everyone like it, it is far from mainstream but there is reason for everything that is drawn and animated. I am certainly bias when it comes to Yuasaâs art, it reminds me of older series, back when things were largely hand drawn, they felt genuine. Now everything seems cold and straight and lacking any warmth or sincerity. And for the majority thatâs probably fine. That bias aside, I believe Yuasaâs eccentric art compliments the series brilliantly. The genuine art resonates with the genuine characters and their plethora of emotions and complications. A wide range of cinematography techniques and symbolism are used to emphasize the deeper aspects of the series. What makes Yuasaâs art truly special is they way he is able to use this symbolism to highlight certain aspects, such as the armor breaking away as Smile is playing against Peco in the finale, this signifies both visually and metaphorically that he truly has transformed. The artistic style is truly limitless in what it is able to illustrate, which is why I truly believe Yuasaâs art to not only be aesthetically beautiful, but also carry depth.
Just like the art, Ushioâs OST is equally synergistic to the series. The score has a wide range of sounds and tracks that have a wide variety of applications for all emotional ranges and actions. Just like the art, there are many tracks on the OST that go beyond an enjoyable listening experience, which is to be expected when it comes to any high quality score. The âHero Themeâ is not only a phenomenal composition, but the use of it really exhumes raw emotion, it is engaging to listen to and it harmonizes well with what is transpiring. Smileâs âMonsterâ theme really reiterates the robotic personality he has. Ultimately, the OST has a brilliant atmosphere that only strengthens the series. Not only this but both the sound effects and editing are done phenomenally, nothing sounds out of place.
Ping Pong reaches a standard very few anime will ever reach. Driven by flawless characterization, a beautiful story of growth, maturation and life itself is expertly illustrated. It is a series that certainly breaks the mould, avoiding the restrictions and cliches that run rampant through both the genre and animation in general. It is a story thatâs message and characters are likely to resonate with the viewer, something only true art can accomplish. Ping Pong is Masaaki Yuasa at his best. Ping Pong is true art.
Thanks for taking the time to read.",10,Rqt

                Oh yeah, Ping Pong: The Animation.
I know I'll get reports and dislikes for this one,
but please bear with me, since this is my oppinion.
Story: 4/10
The story of Ping Pong is probably one of the poorest executed versions of 'Cliche-Sports-Story Mk I'. There isn't even much I could spoil. What do you expect of the most cliched sportsstory?
Take a while and imagine. I'll give you a hint its the same principle used in next to every shounen, as well as probably every sports anime.
I don't have much of a problem with such a storyline in itself, but if the story is like that, you'd need some
                  other points to make up for it. And I simply couldn't find anything to make up for it. There is no comedy, no fanservice, no action scenes or anything else which made up for the classical storyline.
Art: 1/10
The original manga is actually from 1995 while the anime aired 2014. Still, at that time anime like Detective Conan or Dragonball also aired. Why would I be ever pleased with that art? In a way this style is really unique. Yes, I definitely haven't seen something like this before.
The background arts -> boring
The character designs -> ugly
The animations -> simply pathetic
If you want an idea of what I mean by ugly character desings, just click one of the pictures above in the characters section. Most of the characters look like they didn't want to spend more time then necessary on the characters. The characters are merely some rough outlines, with some strokes as facial expressions. This can't obviously be enough.
As for why the animation is simply pathetic: I noticed it rather early in one of the table tennis games. The ball nearly went to the ground, but they got it back on the table. In a straight line. From UNDER the table. One of the greatest physic fails of all time.
Sure, this might be intentionally by the drawers. Or it might just as well be a crude mistake.
I personally prefer realistic and fluent movements.
For reference also a reason why the background arts are boring: In the first episodes, the main characters gym is presented. Fair enough. In the later episodes, the rivaling school has the exact same gym. Well with everything which was green in the main heroes gym being purple...
Summed up, the rather low quality of the anime completely distracted me from everything else.
It took several hours for me to get used to it, and by that time the anime was already half over.
Sound: 4/10
The voice acting was basically mediocre. The only voice I even remember is Wengs. I'm personally a fan of using original languages with foreigner characters. And well, Weng, or his seiyu, pulled that one off pretty good. Next, the BGM: unmemorable.
And I mean unmemorable. I watched one of the episodes again, just caring for BGM. And theres next to none to begin with. This one might be for style reasons, making the actually existing ones more important, but those that actually exist are just mediocre tracks sadly.
As for how they are mediocre. They sound generic and could be used in every anime. They don't connect to what the anime wanted to present, or at least thats what it feels like for me.
Last, we have the opening and ending, which both were, to be honest, absolute forgettable as well. Just as the BGM, if there wasn't the video, I would never even imagine that this would be Ping Pongs Opening/Ending, which is really sad.
Character: 4/10
And once again Kong Weng is the guy who saves up some points.
Both his background, as well as his character was well fleshed out and, to top it off, realistic.
I really disliked both main characters, because both only have one or two memorable traits.
Their backgrounds get described every once in a while in some talkes other characters have, and to be honest, those backgrounds are, just as the story, used a hundred times, again.
This is one of the mainreasons I didn't enjoy Ping Pong at all. Everything seems just like we've all seen it before, with nothing which elevates it out of the masses.
The character development, especially Smiles, came off rather forced.
Pecos on the other hand, was the classic shounen development. Its a reasonable one, but once again an abused one.
At least the side characters are, compared to other anime, acceptable.
They have some traits that make them enjoyable, backstories that might make them interesting or developments, which make them more vived. But, here as well, these are the classical ideas, used just another time.
Enjoyment: 1/10
I only laughed once in the whole anime. And thats because of a scene where the arts nearly killed me. I personally hated this stuff, but since its a Top 100 I wanted to give it a shot and also have it completed.
Overall: 3/10
In my opinion one of the poorest anime I've seen so far, and I'm at 100 days of watching anime.
Maybe you're better off trying it for yourself, because I absolutely disliked it and can't possibly recommend it. Maybe you'll come to like something, I absolutely didn't.
If you're interested in sports anime however, just go with Kuroko no Basket. If you're interested in good character development, go with one of KEYs works, either Clannad, Little Busters!, or Angel Beats.",3,Play2X

                Ping Pong The Animation is my one hundredth completed Anime up until this point in my Anime watching hobby/career, and I would feel bad about myself if I did not review this amazing Anime, and let this opportunity all go to waste. So why did I choose Ping Pong The Animation, in particular, to be my one hundredth Anime to be completed? Why not choose any other Anime out of the thousands of Anime on the site? Why Ping Pong in particular? Well, there are many good reasons for that. First of all, I wanted my one hundredth Anime to be something of great quality,
                  and for it to be something that has a different, yet a great art style and animation to boot. I also wanted it to be something that has a compelling story to tell and amazing characters to introduce and develop all the way through up until itâs final episode. Lastly, I wanted a great story, but a story that is short and can wrap up everything it introduced nicely in just eleven episodes of nothing but pure, adrenaline pumping ping pong matches. Since I very much enjoyed Kaiba, which was made by the same director, Masaaki Yuasa, I thought that I might give this one Anime a try and have it take the honor to be my one hundredth completed Anime. I had already watched and enjoyed most of the short and eminent works in Anime before, and Ping Pong The Animation looked promising to be next in line. So, did Ping Pong The Animation fail in entertaining me? Absolutely not! Was it amazing all the way through? Definitely! A not so great concept, an average sports concept, and a lame sport, all of those things turned into one of the greatest sports Anime of all time. It achieved this by using brilliant execution and cinematography, introducing three dimensional characters, and spicing it all up with a great and memorable soundtrack. I would be lying to myself if I said that I wasnât addicted to this Anime, glued to my screen while watching everything these amazing characters did. Kaiba may have been a good Anime by Masaki Yausa, but this was truly something else. 
The story of Ping Pong starts off with a very simple premise, some guys at an academy are competing to win the grand prize in a sport they are playing. The premise of Ping Pong is not so great to be honest. A lot of stories in Anime have way better premises to work with than what Ping Pong has here, but most of them fail when it comes to executing their basis and living up to their full potential. Ping Pong The Animation, in contrast, is a story about people who are working hard to be the very best at Ping Pong. It is not one of the best premises in Anime, it is not even good per say, it is just an average and routine premise. It has no fancy super powers, it has no mechas or magic, nor does it have any evil villains to work with. The premise is as average and realistic as a premise can get. What sets Ping Pongâs basic story apart from most other Anime titles, though, is the execution of itâs ideas and the subversion of the audienceâs expectations. Ping Pong executes itâs ideas so well and amazes itâs audience by how good an average scene can turn out to be with just the right amount of angles and heart pumping music, and it is an Anime that lives up to itâs potential fully by doing so. I also mentioned that this Anime likes to subvert audience expectations and it is not as predictable as you might expect it to be. Really, I was blown away by how much my expectations were subverted during this Animeâs run. An example of a scene from Ping Pong, where expectations will be subverted, would be when two players are against playing each other and one of them has the upper hand during the match. Normally, you would think that the player with the upper hand has the victory secured in the bag, but you would be wrong to assume that. With one trump card from the loser, everything can be turned around and be reset again. This does not become clichÃ© during Ping Pongâs run though, as Ping Pong does not depend on subverting audience expectations most of the time. Sometimes, if a match seems in favor of a player, then that match is guaranteed to be in their favor until the very end. With all of those things Ping Pong possesses, Ping Pongâs plot becomes realistic and surprising at the same time. It becomes surprising due to how unpredictable it can be, and it becomes realistic because it does not always lead to scenarios we want/we think it will go to. Ping Pong The Animation not only possesses those attributes in terms of storytelling, which make it a great Anime, but some more that make it stand out above most others. The three dimensional characters this Anime created, and their different motives and diverse disciplines, make this Anime a treat to watch all the way through. I was glued to my screen, wanting to know what character A will do next, or what character C will do when he faces off against character G. Speaking of the brilliant characters, all of them are developed and are given their own personality, not one is left out, which makes the story even more enthralling than it already is.
I also like how the story does not shy away from asking the deep, philosophical questions most other stories do not want to address. I do not think any other sports Anime has looked into itâs characters the way Ping Pong The Animation has looked into itâs own. The Anime not only unfolds an incredible journey of well developed, determined characters in front of your eyes, but also explores them deeply while asking meaningful questions and covering mature topics. âWhy do we play ping pong in the first place? Why do we play the sport? Is it to have fun? Is it to win? Is it to pass time until we become mere bones?â and that is what I like about Ping Pong, it is a sports Anime, but it is also a psychological Anime as well, not shying away from asking important questions within itâs narrative and challenging the viewer. It is a simple story executed to almost perfection, and it adds to it's great narrative by not being shy of reaching out to cover heavier topics. 
What turns an Anime from a good one to a great one? Three dimensional, interesting characters. I like it when the characters are so interesting and developed, to the point where a face-off between them actually makes me want to see it, and gets me pumped up for it in the process. Ping Pong does exactly that. The characters are so realistic and interesting, each one of them going through their own development and having their own motives, to the point where the Anime can pit anyone of them against each other and it would still be interesting to watch. The thing about this Anime is that all of it's characters are so well developed, to the point where I cannot choose which one of them is my favorite. Obviously China is the best according to my heart, but he has some fierce competition coming his way from both Peco and Smile, who are both as brilliant as China when it comes to their motives/characterization. Let us start off with China/Kong Wenge, the best character in the show in my honest opinion. This is the guy that oozes cool whenever he appears on the screen, and he is legitimately entertaining and exciting to watch. Whenever China appeared on the screen, I thought âThis is definitely going to become entertaining now.â China is seriously so cool, to the point where he would smoke both Spike Spiegel and Yusuke Urameshi in a cool contest. The best thing about China though, and what separates him from the other characters in this Anime, is that he starts off as one dimensional at first, while the rest of the cast get development right from the spot. It isnât until China loses his cool in a match that we finally get to see more layers to him. With that being said, China becomes perfect for this series because he subverts the audienceâs expectations, where the audience thinks that he is the typical Anime bad-ass with no feelings or emotions, and then he turns out to be the most layered character in the whole series.  That is what I like about China, it is that he subverts viewer expectations into thinking that he is one dimensional at first, due to his egotistical attitude and calm demeanor, but you would be wrong to assume that. Yes, China is cool, calm and collected, and he does start off that way in the Anime, but he changes immensely once the plot kicks in. It is ironic how China is supposed to be portrayed as this bad-ass winner at first, but he becomes more human than the protagonist, Tsukimoto Smile. 
Speaking of Smile, his character development is very satisfying to watch and look at, why? Because Smile is the opposite of both Peco and China. While the other two start off as calm and collected, thinking that they are the best at what they do and that no one can even touch them, Smile starts off as the complete opposite. Smile starts off thinking that he is a pathetic loser, and unlike the other two, he only plays the game to âpass time until he is deadâ and not to win. It isnât until Smile is finally pushed beyond his breaking point that he actually starts to become like the other two. It isnât until Smile is put in a stressful situation like that of Chinaâs that he finally starts to reach into his ego and become more like China. And that is the beautiful thing about China and Smile, both of them begin to change when they start to lose or when they are put in a stressful situation, but one of them begins to become the bad-ass while the other starts to become more on the emotional side. They do change, but they change and are still two opposites of the same coin. The normal guy passing time becomes the bad-ass trying to win, while the bad-ass trying to win becomes the normal guy passing time. Did I mention earlier how an Anime confrontation can be exciting to watch when the characters are well developed and interesting on their own? Well, when China and Smile faced off against each other, I was thrilled because those two had such a great dynamic with each other, due to them being polar opposites, but also being one in the same. Smile is a great character on his own, and as I said earlier, his development is satisfying to watch and to look at. 
Other characters like Peco, who is supposed to be another main character, is also multilayered and three dimensional. He is the polar opposite of Tsukimoto, and his character arc is just as good as Tsukimotoâs. Peco starts off as your average born talent, born to win and conquer the ping pong industry. Peco, just like Wenge, also suits this Anime because of how unpredictable his character arc is. Peco starts off with a huge ego and an âI am holier than thouâ attitude. We think that he is the main character of the Anime, but as it turns out, he really is not. After seeing Peco dominate the rookies, it isnât until he is trashed and skunked by both China Wenge and his former teammate from Kaio academy, that his character arc takes a major turn. After his two big losses, he simply cannot believe the outcomes of the situations, and he finally starts to become less like China Wenge, and more like the old Tsukimoto, while Tsukimoto, due to his winning streaks and the stress he was placed under, starts to become more like China Wenge and less like the old Tsukimoto. We then get to see Peco go on his own journey until he can get back what he has lost, and it isnât until reality crushes his hopes and dreams, and he is placed under the same situation Tsukimoto was placed in, that he actually starts to put in that hard work and sweat into his day to day life, instead of relying on his mere talents alone. 
With of all of that being said, this is the beautiful thing about these three main characters. Tsukimoto, Wenge and Peco are all one in the same, but they change and develop to the point where they never are a copy of one another. The three of them all have huge egos at one point in the Anime, but they experience it at different times. They also start off as clichÃ© characters, but their interactions with one another help turn them into brilliant characters on their own. This is especially the case with Wenge, who starts off as one dimensional as they can get, but develops to be the best character in the series. 
Aside from the three main characters, I really liked Ryuuichi Kazama, the main member of the Kaio Academy table tennis club. He is highly respected by the other club members and is somewhat of a local hero. He represents the idea of the winner very well. You see all of these winners in life, all of these champions who have countless medals, but do you see what is underneath the act that they put on infront of the masses? Kazama is an amazing character because underneath the surface of being a hero and a champion, he is just a guy who feels pain like the rest of the cast, he has insecurities that he does not want to show, because he was placed in a situation in which he cannot escape from. He was born to train, the pressure was so great and overwhelming to the point where he canât escape from it now, he has to do it because it has become a responsibility instead of a hobby. He is like an addict, no matter how hard he tried, and even if he wanted to, he just cannot escape the addictive nature of training and winning matches. There is a quote in the series which describes him perfectly, and that quote says âI am sure you will understand too, someday. The melancholy of winning. The pain of praise. The weight on your shouldersâ¦ the loneliness and agony. The time will come where your efforts will seem meaningless and your victories empty.â
In the end, what is so good about the thousands of victories, the thousands of medals, the thousands of fans and all the praise, when one cannot love themselves? Of course, Kazama, just like the others, gets his development sooner or later, because every character in Ping Pong does. 
Moving on to the visuals, this part might seem a bit tricky. Ping Pong The Animation does not shy away from being something that is different. It does not care about the rest, it starts off not caring about the opinions of others and ends on the same exact note. It does not stick to the same old tropes that other Anime stick to and bore you with, it strays away from them. A lot of people mention that they are turned off by the art style for the show. I just have to say that I completely disagree with all of those people who are saying that. This is why this part of the technicalities is tricky, it is because people have contentions with the dirty looking, unorthodox art style. It might set some people off, but that just wasn't the case here with me.  
The staff went for something different in this show. They did a lot of the animation in Flash, and it looks incredibly weird and awkward compared to most mainstream anime, but I think that lends a character to the show that a lot of Anime do not have. This type of visual and âdirty lookâ that the show has really distinguishes it from the rest, and makes it stand out as something that looks diverse. The visuals and character designs may not be the absolute best, but they are very memorable and recognizable. I like that it's not pristine, with sharp edges and smooth curves. The animation, especially later on in the series, feels wild and evokes emotion of itâs own. It feels like the animators are just letting loose and it gives so much weight to the actions of the characters. It makes Ping Pong The Animation seem more fluid when it comes to the movements of itâs characters, which is exactly what a sports Anime like this needs to be striving for. 
I like the camera angles displayed in this Anime, they do not look amateur or mediocre, but look pleasing to the eyes. Yausa was a master when it came to representing scenes with different angles in Kaiba, and he does it very well here. I also like how they represent the allegories and metaphors in this show. For example, Wenge/China in the first episode shoots up the ball to the roof when facing off against Peco, an airplane appears in place of the roof. I like that, it shows us more depth to Wenge, but without grabbing our hand and giving us all of the details about his backstory in one go. China is supposed to be a transfer who left his country, or was transferred because of failure, using imagery to convey his story was a brilliant idea. Other than that, I thought that the designs were all great. Each character felt distinguishable from one another, but they actually felt like they belonged in the same Anime, different enough to give each one a unique sense of style and personality, but not so different to the point where they feel like they belong in a different show. I also like how all of them look realistic, no orange haired kid, no red haired kid, no blue haired girl or any of that sort, just natural and realistic hair color. 
As for the soundtrack, it does more than it's job. It is striking and memorable, just like the art style. On another note, I liked âInitialize Meâ and some other tracks while listening to the soundtrack of Kaiba, so I expected nothing less from the same director when it came to the soundtrack of this show. Really, what can I say? The coolest track in this Anime is âChinaâ, and that is ironic because I also believe that China is the coolest character in this Anime as well. I also like the track that is called âPecoâ because it perfectly describes Pecoâs character (happy, go lucky, enthusiastic). All of these tracks are great tracks on their own to be honest, but the one that I was addicted to the most would have to be âLike A Danceâ, which perfectly places the viewer in the mood to watch the adrenaline pumping ping pong matches this Anime displays in front of them. These are the types of tracks that you actually take time to download to your phone due to how amazing they are to listen to, especially the case with âLike a Danceâ. The opening is great and the ending is great, nothing to complain about here, I was pumped with every âOh Yeahâ the opening slapped me with. I liked all of the voice actors, and the English dub is done by none other than Funimation, so it is guaranteed to be good. The one that stood out the most to me, though, was China as well. His Mandarin accent and voice acting were brilliant to listen to, and it added more character to him as a whole. China on his own is probably the best character in the series, but the mandarin accent was a very cool touch to a cool character like him. 
Overall, Ping Pong The Animation is very close to being a masterpiece, and I am not just saying that because it is my one hundredth completed Anime. I do not like to give random nines or tens to any Anime that I watch, but this definitely deserves it. It is less of a sports Anime, and more of an amazing human psyche discovery. It asks thought provoking questions, it brilliantly presents amazing characters and develops them well, it pumps you up and keeps your blood boiling with some epic music and action packed, smooth animation to boot. Disregarding all of that, what Ping Pong The Animation does best, which most other Anime fail at doing, is that it also keeps the viewer glued to the screen. Once you start with Ping Pong The Animation, you will want to binge watch and finish it all in one go. Kaiba was good, but it was boring and discomforting during some parts. Ping Pong The Animation never felt boring at all, it keeps moving forward and entertaining the audience with something. I am glad that I watched and experienced Ping Pong The Animation, and I highly recommend anyone go check it out.",9,Optigisa

                THIS IS THE GREATEST...................................DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!
This show is ass and not the good kind.
I am going to compare it to Van Gogh's 1888 ""The Night CafÃ©"" throughout this review. When anyone looks at ""The Night CafÃ©"", they see a subpar painting. They are standing there confused as to why everyone is proclaiming this to be a fine piece. You need to know that the light green bar is representative of the green fairy. You need to know that the clock is just past twelve so it isn't tactful to be drinking during either time. You have to know that the warm walls with the white tables will
                  cause the tables to seemingly walk away from the walls if heavily intoxicated. Then you must be aware that the yellow room in the back is inviting and is everything that isn't the room you are currently in. I can go on about this piece for about ten minutes and I feel like I am pretending to be every zealot who loves ""Ping Pong The Animation"".
Just like ""The Night CafÃ©"", people go out of their way to polish a turd. People make it sound like it is the only ""coming of age tale"" when there are indeed tons of them. ""Coming of age"" may as well be it's own genre. They recycle the exact same scenes when showing character development. Let's watch Peco get slapped again. Let's see if Ping Pong Man becomes anything significant. I have played sports and I was good at some and not so good in others. Big deal! I personally lived the best part of this anime with little to no effort. I like abstract representational art. I appreciate the use of symbolism and scale to convey points. This show borderline took the piss with it's art. No one could have actually been touched by the guy on the beach. He was wandering around like an emo kid and it kept reoccurring without anyone caring about him. 
The art-style is awful. I understand wanting to stay true to the source material, but alterations would have been seriously advised. Let's take something everyone loves; Steins;Gate. The art in the anime was similar to the VN, but someone with common sense realized that it would be a feat to keep that style up for an entire anime. They took some polish off and kept the same feeling. This is an adaption done correctly. I have seen cars hit by trains that had smoother lines than what this animation has given us. People fail to realize failure when they love something and overlooking flaws is a virtue. The quality of an abstract non-representational piece of ""art"" done by a 5 year old that has been given three colors will be of the same caliber.
I want to touch on the music quickly. There is one good song called ""Dragon"" and it goes ""Hoo-Ha PING PONG"" and then repeats. There is also one song that is so bad they didn't even put it on the OST. Listen for the humming song in the show if you want to go into an audio induced coma.
The show was not enjoyable and I cannot believe that this is rated so highly. This show demonstrates how strong the troll community is by jokingly rating this show a 10. Most people that love this show have an average of less than 6 because they are the wannabe anime critics/hardasses and they all need a joke like ""Cory in the House"" to keep in their own circle.
Avoid the show at all costs. Not worth your time.",3,Midg3tLuv

                Ping Pong the Animation.
It's one of those series that is either going to get over-the-top praise or disdain from it's watchers, for me it was simple disappointment.
Story: 5
-Well like most sports anime the story is not too heavy. However Ping Pong's biggest problem is that the story and how it plays out has been done before, several times in fact. You can see the ending from the start and every ""twist"" isn't all that surprising once you get to the end. I was not entertained when it came to the story and it's presentation. 
NOTE: I do not take away points for it being a
                  sports anime and having a sports-themed story. I take away points for unoriginal and poor presentation.
Art: 7
-I'd say the art is mediocre. Not because ""it's not HD so it sucks"" but because funimation purposefully made the anime this way, but still re-used animation within the first few episodes. I actually like this type of animation if it's done right, but way too many times in this series is it not. Funimation clearly had the budget for this anime, but chose to make several scenes look out of place and terrible because they didn't know what they were doing or didn't care.
NOTE: The art style fits well with the theme.
Sound: 4
-It's there and not much else. Nothing outside of your generic background music and nothing you'll even remember in T-minus 5 minutes.(already forgot).
Characters: 7
-Now the characters in this show are pretty well done. I'd like to say they are ""deep"" but they really weren't. Only Hoshino and Tsukimoto really stood out, as everyone else became X, Y, or Z stereotype. That being said, Hoshino and Tsukimoto were deep in accordance to the story but not as characters themselves. ""One track mind"" would describe the entire youth of this cast. However there interactions are at least midly entertaining.
Enjoyment: 6
I can't say I enjoyed my time watching this series more than the general mediocre anime. It's not exactly entertaining per episode, I've seen the entire story/characters done before in other series(ala prince of tennis), and to be honest the ending/starting episodes were the only parts I think were worth the watch.
Overall: 5
Ping Pong the Animation is a series that presents a rather mediocre product to an already saturated genre. The art style differentiates it, but does not make it shine.
I'd recommend it to people who have not watched other sports series.
Note: this is all my opinion, but I stand by that opinion 100%.",5,sjwho2

                Ping Pong won the all exciting adventure this spring season of anime was and became anime of the season. Spring 2014 winner, woohoo. 
Ping Pong is an anime about life which centers around Ping Pong. The first challenge we viewers face is ironically the faces itself. Everyone looks the same, it is a pain to remember all the characters when they don't have different colored hairs nor any bishonen tropes on their character design. Our main characters are pretty easy. The other one is called smile, he never smiles, but he has glasses (not to be confused with megane). He is the most troubled character
                  since he doesn't give a shit about anything or anyone. Especially not about Ping Pong, baaka. The other main character is the opposite of this guy, but isn't as recognizable since he doesn't have glasses or other visible.. details. The opposite of smile who never smiles but he (not smile) actually smiles. Simple. 
There are bunch of other characters too. Some of them are bald, some bold. Some have different colored skin and some speak chinese for life, so it is not impossible challenge to tell them apart. These guys ofc love Ping Pong and want to play that shit till the end of the world and whatnot. Except smile because he just isn't like all the other fucks, okay. The side characters go through the melancholy of being a ping pong player and a teenager by having worries about love and ping pong. Definitely a quality series with many realistic characters who all have much more in them than your typical... anime side character. Definitely a quality series with many interesting people who love ping pong. And smile who just doesn't give a fuck. 
The art of this series follows the art of the manga. The original artist didn't have the most stable hand in the seven kingdoms, but he managed to get the ink on the paper. The art is terribad and awful, but I like it. For once it is not the rest of the series that can be described with those words. The director is not the same sexy guy who directed Death Note, but almost equally sexy guy, the guy who directed Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, I mean. He is doing pretty good job on splitting the image in 3 during every single fucking Ping Pong scene/any other scene. Some say he likes his anime in 3, some say he has 3 eyes. One is sure, this man is a legend, did he try too much or not with Ping Pong. Although he did.
When it comes to enjoyment, I don't usually enjoy anime because it sucks. But this one was pretty okay. I could even recommend it to adults who have it working, or maybe even youngsters too if they have it working.",8,Karhu

                ""He's got to have a hole in his defense! He's reading meâhe's predicting my moves. Show me your weak point! I just can't afford to end here!"" Think these lines are from the latest battle shounen? Wrong: they're from none other than Ping Pong: The Animation! If the theme of table tennis doesn't pique your interest, looking at the show's creators certainly should. Masaaki Yuasa, known for making great creative anime, teams up with Taiyou Matsumoto, a mangaka with similar experimental tendencies: the harmless fun-filled game of table tennis suddenly got a whole lot more interesting.
The very first minutes of the show seek to impress:
                  large shots of the protagonists' table tennis hall, full of life and 2.7-gram balls hitting the table and players doing racket moves. Each chop, smash and drive is animated with shocking accuracy and from the best angles. All of this on watercolor backgrounds with resplendent palettes. Think the show's misshapen character designs do not fit the subject matter? Well, quite the opposite! The ill-proportioned art style not only allows characters to be easily animated from the tilted angles that make this series so full of life, they also explain why racket moves can be animated so accurately. With proportions and shadows being no object, Yuasa's hand moves the characters with real dynamism and diversity.
The series progresses with various table tennis matches, art and animation carrying the visual impact while spot-on writing keeps each match and point varied and suspenseful. But not late in the series does it become clear that Ping Pong is not just about sportsâit's also a powerful coming-of-age story with very engaging characters.
Ping Pong opens with Smile, an apathetic player who sees table tennis as simply a way to pass time. His polar opposite, Peco, is an energetic, eccentric boy aiming to play in the Olympics and Smile's best friend since childhood. The anime spotlights a series of high school tournaments where Japan's best players gather. Kong, an accomplished player from China, has set to conquer Japan to make up for his rejection from his home country's team. Kazama, a member of the renowned Kaio Academy, is on an invincible streak. The stakes are high for those with a reputation, but both Smile and Peco are just starting to make a name for themselves.
For an 11-episode run, the series juggles many characters effortlessly. While Smile and Peco are predominant, plenty of time is allowed to others like Kong, Kazama, even the coaches as we explore their desires, ambitions and conflicts related to table tennis. For example, with Kazuma we are faced with the monotony of being the best, the hard work it requires and its consequences on private life. Kong offers the heartwarming story of how an elite player from China gradually comes to respect little Japan. Peco, introduced with lines such as ""hard work is for chumps with no talent"", learns to believe otherwise throughout the series.
Smile, Peco, Kong, Sakuma, Kazuma... each of them come to rethink the way they  approach table tennis and their reason for playing. All in different ways, the characters find the approach to table tennis that brings them the most joy and peace. The spectrum of table tennis covered is hugeâthrough older characters we even gain insight into the money-minded aspect of the sport. As an 11-episode coming-of-age story, Ping Pong is surprisingly complete and cathartic.
What's even greater about Ping Pong is how expressive its screenplay and dialogue is. For example, in a setting where top performance is imperative, smoking is tacitly rejected: there's a scene where a character lights up a smoke, communicating his desire to stop playing competitively. Another character takes his cigarette off his mouth, and though they say nothing of it, it furthers that other character's will to make him play again. 
Consider the insert song segment in episode 6: this scene has no spoken line, yet it is one of the most meaningful. Kong opens the sequence singing the insert song at a karaoke with his teamâshowing us his development from spiting Japan to opening up to Japanese players and learning their languageâand the scene continues with various shots of the other characters' occupation on Christmas Eve. Smile's part is poignant: unsurprising for a character shown to enjoy solitude, he is all alone at home, contemplating the Christmas cake his coach gifted him. But from Smile's lonely gaze and the candles he paid the effort to light we can tell that the boy does cherish what little warmth others give him. We begin to empathize with the character. Not present in the source material, this karaoke insert demonstrates Yuasa's amazing directing skills in combining spot-on soundtrack, perfect pacing and compelling shots.
Helping Ping Pong transition between matches and character introspection is a diverse and excellent soundtrack. Pounding drums set the tone in pre-game sequences to stir up anticipation, and the next moment whimsical keyboard keys accompany Smile's scattered thoughts and memories. The show has a song for every moment and emotion, each used exceptionally and making for a complete audiovisual experience.
It's amazing what Ping Pong accomplishes in its short 11-episode run. It chronicles the heartfelt physical and emotional journeys of multiple characters and delivers a conclusion brimming with heart yet grounded in reality. All of it conducted in an exciting, creative fashion in the perfect marriage of both Taiyou Matsumoto and Masaaki Yuasa's talent. The harmless, fun-filled game of table tennis did get a whole lot more interesting.

                Ping Pong The Animation, originally created by Matsumoto Taiyou, is more than what one would call unique, even more so if you just look at sports Anime.
The story of Ping Pong The Animation is unexpectedly complex while simple at the same time. It's not a light-hearted watch but nor is it deep enough to drown. The story follows multiple characters, highlighting Peco and Smile, while developing them all in amazing ways. There is always something to look forward to, whether there's a cliffhanger or not. Ping Pong The Animation feels like such a smooth watch; there are no bumps along the way. Doubts were had
                  by many people before it started airing, but those were all cleared in the first episode. Not once did the story break down. It was solid throughout it's duration and left us on an incredibly strong ending. Unfortunately, it's an ending that leaves you begging for more even though there is no more that can be done. It leaves a somewhat small void.
The art and animation is the highlight of this Anime for me. If I had to point at one show with the nicest look, it would be this. No less would be expected Masaaki Yuasa. The Anime strives and succeeds in looking like its source material, and does a grand job in doing so. Ping Pong wouldn't be the same without the unique style it has. This style I mention isn't restricted just to art, but to every single part of the Anime. Some parts look absolutely outstanding, especially in flashbacks or when the Anime is tackling the psychology of a character. The opening and ending look magnificent and really do capture the essence of what is Ping Pong.
The sound in Ping Pong doesn't fall short compared to its other strong points. The sound a ball being hit, the sound of movement on mats, the music featured; it's all amazingly well done. The OST is one of the most surprising things in this Anime. It manages to strengthen every scene. A good OST for a sports Anime is one that gets your blood pumping, one that allows to you to follow what's happening even more closely with ease; that's what Ping Pong's OST does. The seiyuus do an amazing job as well, and the it's no surprise with the seiyuu being who they are. Smile's voice captures that of an emotionless robot which enhances the metaphor constantly used throughout the Anime. Peco is the opposite. He's a quirky, spirited character who's voice is also captured perfectly.
The characters in Ping Pong are phenomenal. No one is just there for the sake of being there. Most characters have their mentality explored in some way even if they only explore once. This is one of my most favourite things about Ping Pong. No one is left out in the dark. Ping Pong fleshes out the characters perfectly with flashbacks and a inner monologue here and there. It sounds like a simple thing to do, but not many series do it well. In addition, the characters feel like magnets; I'm attached to all of them. There's always one character that you're rooting for. There's always one you'll want to see more of. Each character is done justice by the time the series end.
I enjoyed this a whole lot, which is already obvious. Overall, this is an incredibly strong dent built in to the sports genre.  Every single element in this Anime helps another to be something amazing. Each element is nothing without the others. The characters are accompanied greatly by the art, which is boosted up by the music, which is held up by the atmosphere. Everything comes together to create something that is a must watch for a unique, but great experience in the world of Anime.
Recommendation: If you haven't already, and you want more Anime of this level, I suggest you go and check out Tatami Galaxy, which is directed by Masaaki Yuasa.",10,Momoirooooo

                An anime about sports? An anime about ping pong? I would have never thought to ever give a show like this a try, while I do like the occasional play of table tennis in my freetime and during sports at school the idea of watching others playing it in the animated form was somewhat dull but interesting. Having heard from other sources that it is actually quite good and among the best series of this season I decided to check Ping Pong: The Animation out.
Today it has ended and now I'm sitting here at midnight writing this review because continuing Ping Pong after a long
                  break I took from it after episode 2 might have been the best decision I made regarding anime in a long time.
Storywise Ping Pong: The Animation centers around the teenager nicknamed ""Smile"" and others at the Tamura Table Tennis club. It is a sports anime after all and there is -quite fortunately though - nothing happening which could be considered that much out of the ordinary with like super powers you have seen in other sports series. 
The series could be called a Coming-of-Age story. It focuses a lot on the relationships between the players, trainers and others and how their passion of table tennis affects them and others around them. And important part to make this work and catch the audiences sympathy are well done characters. And well done characters is something Ping Pong certainly has. The cast ranges from your more introverted main character to his chaotic childhood friend, to the arrogant yet talented but not flawless foreign antagonist, to the caring coach with a moving backstory and lots of other side characters from different schools, teams and nations wanting to make big. 
But this cannot happen without sacrificies and this is also something this show does well. Table tennis is serious business over there and it portrays it very well. I am not an expert when it comes to foreign tablet tennis but from what I have seen in Ping Pong: The Animation they catched the mood quite well and every anticipated battle felt as exciting and tense as an upcoming showdown in an action series. The atmosphere is really intense and puts shows like Sword Art Online to shame, but not only when it comes to the action. 
Most of this is achieved by the brilliant cinematography which uses an unique and definetly different art style than other shows ever did before. It is kind of hard to get into at first but the drawing style really grows onto you and actually fits the shows theme of being about a rather unusual sport, very well. 
In terms of accoustic accompaniment Ping Pong: The Animation offers everything from chilly background tunes to incentive electronic beats to make the rhythm chime and get you into the right mood. Also the voice actors did an immensily great job on expressing how the characters are feeling. Nothing really to complain about in terms of audiovisual arrangement either.
Nevertheless one of the best parts are the characters. They are portrayed quite life-like as you could expect people to be participating in competitive sports. Every character feels real as you cheer and root for them to achieve their goal they have set in their lives and struggle with the possibility of defeat and others being better than them. They really undergo a well described development which seems believable and makes you care about them. The interactions between each other comes of as genuine and really natural. As their different personalities and egos clash you can really feel the tenseness. The creators did a fantastic job there.
Overall Ping Pong: The Animation is a great show. While it may not be appealing to anyone I can highly recommend it to anyone having the slightest affiliation with table tennis. If you have not this show might not be for you but also if you are just in for something different than you may be welcome here as well since this is a story which can be enjoyed regardless whether you like ping pong or not. It's more about the characters than the actual sport.
It is a sweet Coming-of-Age story about young people trying to find their meaning in life and after this a sports anime. Whether it will be the first place at the championships, social interaction or just to take part to find out in the end they aren't even made for table tennis. It's an emotional and unconventional ride and for me personally the best anime of this season.",9,Nachteule

                To dismiss, or to even think of Ping Pong: The Animation as another sports anime would be a gross error of judgement. Ping Pong: The Animation is not about sports. It is not about Ping Pong. Not really. It is a profoundly human story; a look at the lives, passions, and motivations of characters that sound and act so real that you canât help think of them as real flesh and blood, people with feelings, emotions and souls of their own.
No. Ping Pong is not about sports, or THE sport, or the âathletesâ. It is not about winning or losing. It is against the very
                  concept of competition, the ruthless system that creates winners at the cost of losers. It is a critique of the mindset that glorifies success and distorts life, and things as pure as, say, art, music, and sports (such as Ping Pong), turning these things into a means to achieving selfish desires such as money, power, glory, and honor. When a thing such as ping pong which is meant to direct human passion and creative impulses of man and to allow him to enjoy life by doing things for the sake of the thing itself is distorted or perverted to cater to more selfish desires there arises a need for a savior, a hero, someone to save not just Ping Pong but the true meaning of being alive, of indulging in the pure innocent joy of living, enjoying life and just having fun.
Ping Pong: The Animation is about its characters; it is a coming of age story that explores, among other things, the theme of friendship, and the influence of the past on the present, how our decisions and efforts in the present affect the future and the natural process of constant growth and experience that every single person goes through.
STORY (9/10)
Ping Pong does not has a story or plot in the sense that you can just lay down or explain to someone. It is all about the characters, what they go through, and what they become as a result of their experiences.
It explores its complex of themes through brilliant character sketches, an empathetic narrative, an emotionally profound characterization, a stylish, somewhat surreal art style, and a brilliant direction style that employs a split screen technique to mimic the panels of a manga with occasional bursts of an audio-visual style dubbed as âmagical realismâ. 
CHARACTERS (10/10)
Ping Pongâs main protagonists, if such a thematically nuanced story can have protagonists, are two high-school students and childhood friends,Tsukimoto âsmileâ and Hoshino âPecoâ. Smile is a reserved no-nonsense stoic, and âpecoâ is his complete opposite, a non-serious, sprightly loud -mouth. They both possess a natural talent for Table Tennis (or Ping Pong), go to the same table tennis club, and are the best players of their High School Table Tennis team. 
But their untapped talent is not without strings attached; âSmilesâ lack of ambition and lack of will to win coupled with his gentle personality prevents him from âwinningâ against most opponents. âPecoâ, on the other hand, feels that winning is everything and thinks himself indestructible until he meets a Chinese Student, Weng Kong, who utterly defeats him, prompting him to stop practicing. Another defeat during a tournament leaves him devastated and he abandons the game altogether. 
The animeâs many characters include Coach Koizumi, who recognizes smileâs talent and vows to train him and make him better, and Wenge Kong, a Chinese student who, after being kicked from his Home team in China, travels to Japan to prove himself against the best that Nippon has to offer and redeem his place back home. The anime as an interesting motley of main, side, and minor characters; a whole list of intriguing characters with their own stories, and even the minor ones have been well fleshed out, including a character who after his defeat by Smile early on leaves on a journey to discover himself, only to find that table tennis has always been the passion of his life. 
Going into a detail of all the characters and their roles would be a waste. All I can say is that each character feels painfully and veritably human, is very well developed, and the process of growth that each of them goes through in the story is fascinating to say the least. The painstaking detail with which their characters are crafted, their body language, mannerisms, dialogues, and brilliant voice-acting, makes them feel alive like in a way fictional characters rarely feel so. 
This anime is about the journey all these characters go through, a process that cannot be easily described and has to be experienced by the viewers themselves to be understood and appreciated.
ART/ANIMATION (10/10)
Ping Pongâs art comprises of breathtaking, detailed backgrounds, and minimalist character designs; a combination that allows for great flexibility of expression and creative freedom. Think of Kaiba, Tatami Galaxy, and Tekkon Kinkreet blended together; a combination of the talented Yuasa Masaaki and the unsung auteur of manga Taiyou Matsumoto. The animation is very fluid, stylish, and surreal at times. The jaw-dropping details of the environment, and the complexity of character expression is quite impressive. The art/animation is very different, but not (in my opinion) an acquired taste. 
A notable aspect of the show relating to animation, sound and overall direction is the frequent bursts of âmagical realismâ expressed through images which bring out the emotions and motivations of the characters during action sequences in a comic and fantastical way. For example, Kong Wengeâs desire to return to China is symbolized by a commercial plane in various sequences, Tsukimoto âsmileâ desire to be saved by a hero manifesting during his early childhood experience of being bullied in school is personified by a hero figure, and so on.These sequences perfectly blend with the overall style of the anime and enhance the experience.
SOUND (9/10)
PP:TA showcases a near flawless VA performance, and the right kind of music used (sparingly) at the right time. Background tracks vary from soothing and laid back piano, use of synths and psychedelic tunes, to upbeat and energetic themes, perfectly timed and fitting, setting up the mood appropriate for the scenes. In short, the anime does everything âjust rightâ in this department. 
OVERALL/ENJOYMENT (9/10)
Directed and spearheaded by Yuasa Masaaki (Cat Soup, Tatami Galaxy, Kaiba, Mind Games), and adapted from a manga by Taiyou Matsumoto (Tekkon Kinkreet), Ping Pong: The Animation contains elements reminiscent of previous works by the two makers, such as the theme of friendship, adolescence, empathetic characterization and art of Tekkon Kinkreet, and the wacky, energetic, visceral oddness of Yuasa Masaakiâs previous works. 
Ping Pong has an extremely well written and intelligent script, with some of the best dialogue writing I've come across yet. Yuasa Masaakiâs effortless direction with its âpanel animationâ approach brings alive the pages of the manga in a way no other director could have accomplished. Each episode flows naturally into the next, and the quality almost never falters.
Ping Pong: The Animation is truly a gem, a near-flawless masterpiece that is destined to become a cult classic one day. Or maybe it already is.",9,eyerok

                The anime industry is plagued with generic harems and bad writing. But occasionally a series will appear that stands out. A diamond in the rough. Ping Pong is one of these series. 
The story of Ping Pong is, on the surface, about ping pong. However, dig a little deeper and you will find a fantastic series about growing up. The series focuses on themes such as insecurity, anxiety and most notably, courage. These themes are explored to the fullest with seemingly insignificant scenes such as those featuring The Hero becoming increasingly relevant as the series progresses. This is not to say ping pong isn't relevant
                  to the story, the competitiveness of the sport plays a large part throughout the series and is sure to appeal to any spots fan. It's the kind of show that requires your full attention. Seemingly minuscule and irrelevant events are important to the overall delivery of the series. These can include the speech of background characters or even the backgrounds. The story is paced exceptionally well with the exception of the last episode which as a manga reader I felt was dragged out and features too many flashbacks. Overall, the story is solid. There are lots of interesting themes that are handled very well throughout the series and the pacing is very good.
The art of Ping Pong can be a bit off-putting, but after just one episode it will begin to grow on you. It's unique, and that's a good thing. It makes the series feel very mature (not to say the series isn't) as the art is more realistic than most modern anime. The animation is incredibly fluid. There are some shots of Ping Pong bats that look absolutely fantastic . There are a few scenes with noticeable budget drops, however, and these become increasingly common as the series progresses. Overall, very good animation and art.
The OST of Ping Pong is excellent. Every track fits its purpose well. The OST makes the matches feel very tense and overall very interesting. The OP is very fitting with the lyrics reflecting some of the major themes of the series and the genre fitting the tone of the series as a whole. My personal favourite is the ED, which I feel is excellent. It suits the atmosphere of the series and leaves you wanting more. The voice actors are fitting, particularly Katayama Fukujurou (Peco) and Uchiyama Kouki (Smile). I felt their performances were very good. My praise also goes to Yousei Bun (Wenge Kong) for his performance in Chinese, it's rare not to see anime butcher foreign languages and it was nice of the studio to hire an actual Chinese voice actor for the role. 
The characters in Ping Pong are the best part, in my opinion. They are developed extremely well. I feel Peco's development was handled brilliantly and gives the viewer and in-depth look into his mind and ideologies alongside his emotions. This is not to say other characters are done badly,  Smile, Sakuma, Kong and Kazama all receive incredible growth throughout the series and are for the most part likeable. The transition between Kong's initial arrogance and later his kindness was done beautifully. There is not a single pointless character, they all exist for a reason. Even the seemingly insignificant speech of the background characters is important. There's not a single undeveloped character and for this reason, I believe the characters are the best part of Ping Pong. 
Ping Pong is a very enjoyable series. Every episode leaves you wanting more. The series makes you feel a range of emotions from pity to happiness. It was a very fun series to watch.
Ping Pong is an excellent series, a must-see for all anime fans. The themes, the characters, the music; everything is brilliant. I believe the anime to be better than the manga, and by choosing the manga you would be missing out. The series does require the full attention of the viewer however, and for this reason it's not the easiest to marathon because there's a lot to take in. Otherwise though, it's one of the best series of 2014 at the time of writing.",10,CD2411

                - NOT A SPOILER FREE REVIEW -
This review was made to make people fully understand this show, which often makes people confused, not because it is hard to understand, but because the show tries to push in 11 episodes as much motives as it takes and the full meaning is not as visible as it is needed to understand it while watching it for the first time.
If you didn't like Ping Pong the Animation or didn't really understand what was going on in there i encourage you to read this review.
Ping Pong the Animation is an exceptional show, unorthodox in every aspect, at first glance
                  a normal sport show, but turns out to be something more, a strong emotions feel trip about different people struggling with life and finding their definition of happiness. The Ping Pong as a game itself is not really important for the plot, you can swap it with anything you want, even life itself, the game is only an excuse to portray characters motives, represent their state of mind, because Ping Pong the Animation isnât really much of a sports show, there are no cool techniques, the matches are excitatory and artistic, which is job of an eccentric art and unparalelled animation made by Yuasa Masaaki, who is often praised for his work and the soundtrack which perfectly fits the atmosphere and propel the more tense scenes and make some of them truly epic. The stars of this show are: Tsukimoto, Peco, Kong Wenge, Kazama and Sakuma. What makes this show stand out is the fact, that every character starts with a big lack, something that either limits them or makes them unhappy. In the middle of the show something happens to them that turns their point of view upside down and and eventually every one of them positively changes. Everyone wins in this 
Kong Wenge is a Chinese player who got kicked out of the national China team and decides to transfer to Japan to make himself a name there which might allow him to go back to his team. He was cocksure and full of himself, disgusted by the way everyone plays and ensured that no one is on his level and no one even deserves to stand on the same table with him. He wanted to return to his homeland so badly, but he knew he's stuck in here. The theme with a plane flying away symbolises moving back to China, every time when he looked up at a flying plane he yearned for homeland and playing for his old team, but he knew he's not able to do so. In the first tournament he barely lost to Tsukimoto, he won only because of Tsukimoto's mercy for him, but eventually got skunked by Kazama later on. That was his biggest lesson of humility in his life. He lost twice to people whom he didn't respect. Now he is forced to reckon with the fact that Japan may now be his home. After the tournament his trainer tolds him that honestly his life only starts and he just have gotten on start line, it doesn't matter if he fails at Table Tennis. He gets offered a job of training a team. Kong turns to be a wonderful trainer, he's sharing useful advices with his students and is encouraging them to train. Even after defeat he's not giving up on playing Ping Pong and still trains to get better. In the second tournament when he played Peco and still lost, the ""plane"" flied away, but he doesn't care anymore. He's not willing to go back to China, because Japan is now his home, he found something that holds him here and it was his team for which he was a Leader and inspiration. If you cannot reach something you want, then look up to the things you have already got and seek for good things in them. At the end of the show we see that his will to continue training even after constant defeats paid out - he moved out to Europe and started playing on Olympic level. 
Hoshino Yutaka, alias Peco is a truly gifted player, he even could outplay older players as a child, he was always in the spotlight, but his constants victories and his natural capabilities made him really full of himself and eventually got slothful and lazy. Instead of training and developing his skills he was eating candies and snacks. When he played Kong Wenge in the first episode he got totally skunked, he haven't even scored one point. He never experienced that big defeat before. He celebrated his defeat with tears and despair and eventually he got even more lazy, which made him completely unprepared for the competition ahead of him. In the first tournament he noticed that Smile had almost won with Kong Wenge - the player that he lost to without scoring any point. It was a great shock, because he was always thinking that he is better than Smile. In the same tournament he played Sakuma, who was always worse than him up to this moment, but over time he overcame the difference in skill between them with hard work and dedication to sport and it ended up in lose for Peco. Sakuma laughed down at him telling that he should give up on the sport, because he is no longer good. Constant defeats and his descention in skill made him lost his confidence and eventually ended up on decision to give up on Table Tennis. Peco started eating even more snacks, got fat, adust and started smoking. He got into a relationship that didn't really work out, the girl broke up with him just because he didn't bring up her Christmas Gift. Later on when Peco visits his old Ping Pong club where he mets Sakuma. He tells Peco that he need to go back to Ping Pong, because he loves that sport more than anyone else. Peco after seeing photo featuring him and Tsukimoto holding a trophy, gets reminded of his love for the sport and goals of becoming the greatest and ultimately decides to go back to Table Tennis. He determines to start from the very beginning, trains very hard and develops his skills even further which results in winning the second tournament. Peco is the hero of Ping Pong, and he represents all that the show values and believes in. He does not fear defeat - because he plays for his earnest love of the game, and his earnest love of those he plays with. While playing Kazama and Smile whom are content to remain safe in their own cages, Peco lifts them up with his belief, and they lift him higher in turn. I know and im sure you know too some people who got that kind of passion for their lifes. 
Sakuma, alias ""Devil"" is a childhood friend of Peco and Smile. He's got no talent for Table Tennis, because of an eye astigmatism that doesn't allow him to achieve the same response time as other players, which is essential in Table Tennis. Always envious to Peco for his great Ping Pong capabilities, for that he was always in the center of attention unlike him and got so many trophies for winning. He decided to work hard to overcome the obstacle that he met while playng on a higher level and eventually found a place in prestigious Kaio sport club which resulted in winning with Peco. After the first tournament he challenged Smile for a game. It was shocking experience for him since he didn't know that Tsukimoto might become that good. He totally lost, defeat at Smileâs hands forces him to realize that sometimes you just donât have the aptitude to achieve your dreams, even thought he was a little relieved with that fact. That was the turning point for his life, because he no longer was limited by desire to win. In the second tournament he seems to be happy and in the end of the show it is said that he started a family. If you have no talent in something you shouldn't cry about that, just find something else that you are good in and move on, or focus on something else, life doesn't end on Ping Pong.
Then there is this dude, who played Tsukimoto in the first tournament. After he lost, he decided that Table Tennis is not for him and he decided to travel around the world and find his place on Earth. He tried on the beach, on the mountains, on the desert, but every time he felt that this is not what he was looking for. After a year he ended up on the second tournament in Japan. Tears filled his eyes when he realized that it was Ping Pong all along that he loved, but he have given up too easily on it, just because of one defeat. Witnessing the match between Peco and Smile, he rejuvenated his love for Ping Pong and eventually found his way to the Olympic stage (at the end of the show he is sitting on the stands with Japan national team shirt on).
""Defeat is death"", ""The truth lies in victory"" - those are the slogans of Kaio, sport club obviously aiming to be the greatest that is never fully pleased with their athletes performance. Sport hall opened 24/7 available for training, trainers from around the world, in-depth analyses of training, highest quality sports equipment available to players for free, the usage of modern medicine to keep athletes bodies in perfect condition. Those are only the few of opportunities that Kaio is providing for their players. The only condition is - if you're not playing well enough, you're getting kicked out. They are even getting cut bald to not let hair distract players while playing. Kaio is a factory of robots playing Table Tennis for the victory. Kazama Ryuuichi is magnificently talented player which is the best player of Kaio sport club and their biggest trump card. He has been taught that the only route to success is victory, believes that the failings of others are definable and surpassable as lack of effort. Not only does he not rely on the strength of others, but he also doesnât lend others his strength. The amount of stress he used to experience, because of his responsibility everyone are trying to bestow overwhelms him. Ping Pong has become a cage for Kazama - he used to close in the toilet and stand alone in his stall, staring silently down at his purple ping pong shoes before any bigger competitive, because of the fear. While he was playing with Peco in the second tournament he could see him ""flying"". Though walls of his bathroom are closed, the ceiling is open. Kazama can still look, can still reach, can still dream. The match between Peco and Kazama ends not in dour dramatics, but in laughter, in a shared love of the sport. Kazama's play defined fear, but Peco manages to break through to him and show him through competition and love that there is joy in these exchanges. At the end of the show he's telling that he got kicked out of the professional team, but as the time passed he learned to overcome failures gracefully. He's not afraid anymore, either victory or defeat, he will be able to face it boldly.
Makoto Tsukimoto, a friend of Peco that was introduced to Table Tennis by him, called ""Smile"", because of his lack in expressing any emotions often insulted by his classmated. When he started playing Ping Pong - he was smiling like a madman. Peco gave a lesson to everyone that tried to insult him and pulled him out of a ""cage"" he was sitting in, because of that Peco has become his role model and ""hero"", he wanted to be just like him. At the start of the show Tsukimoto wasn't smiling at all. It was because he didn't feel any motivation for playing Table Tennis. It was because Peco was playing bad and behaved pathetic. Smile after years proved to be horribly good player, his overwhelming power becomes evident. He was subconsciously letting Peco him win to not hurt feelings of his ""hero"", which later on trainer Koizumi noticed. He even gets scouted by Kazama from Kaio, but it was Koizumi who awakened his potential. He starts training under his wings, not because he wanted to, but because he just wanted to win, he truly started behaving like a robot. Even though he got the power to crush every player he faced he couldn't help with loneliness he constantly felt, he spent Christmas Eve alone, even training Table Tennis with Koizumi would be better. Tsukimoto was told since he was very young that he's a ""robot"", that he is emotionless and incapable of feeling. However, Peco still remembers why Smile is called by that nickname, smiling is an emotion too, Tsukimoto have to feel that human emotion - Smile - again and remind to himself why he started playing. After Peco won with Kazama, he knew that his ""hero"" is back and he don't need to hold back anymore - it was always Pecoâs joyfulness that made Table Tennis so wonderful for him. While playing with Peco he slowly came to realize why he is playing the game. It is because ""Blood tastes like Iron"", it is the taste of blood in your mouth after a big effort that make it truly worth experiencing (We are alive song). At the end Smile throwns the racket in the air and shows that it no longer have any hold on him, he have to find happiness by his own way now. He can toss the racket free without regrets, because he now knows who he wants to be - a teacher.
The scene on the train when Smile says âthe one after nextâ is relevant to just about everything the show discusses. Smile waits for his hero to make it to him at the finals - the match after Pecoâs âawakeningâ vs Kazama. Kong fights to make it to his next match - to find a home for him and his mother. The whole show is really about what comes after what you are doing now. Ping Pong the Animation doesn't show it's characters falling, because of their patheticism, but because they need to fail. Every one of their defeats made them stronger. Failure in Table Tennis is not the end of the world. Making it to the next match is much less difficult when you are passionate about what you are doing. Pecoâs love for ping pong is exactly what allows him to get to his next match, because there is always something else waiting for you. The whole point of the show is to not seek for victory. Victory will not give you timeless satisfaction, only seeking seek true passion and joy from what you're doing just like Peco will provide it to you.

                Note: This is my first really serious review, so any feedback is appreciated!
Where do I even begin. I've asked myself that question about that show time and time again. I guess the best place to start, as always, is the beginning. Be warned, there are slight spoilers although I try not to. It's hard gushing about a show I love so much now without talking about ALL of it.
I saw this show on the Spring anime list. I thought, ""I like ping pong, that's pretty funny, I wonder what the show will be about."" I had not read the manga, I did not know any
                  of the backstory. Looking back at it now, I much preferred it that way. 
The first episode was good. Not incredible, but good enough for me to say ""Hey, maybe this can go somewhere."" As I continued to watch, every week, I thought, ""No way, this just can't get any better. There's absolutely no way this show could be any more awesome."" And then, just like that, it was over. It was 11 weeks but it felt like a flash.
What caught me initially, what really hooked me and continued to play a strong role throughout the whole show (and what I'll be focusing on in the review, for good reason), were the characters. Oh man, the characters. Smile, Peco, Kazama, Butterfly Jo, the mountains guy, Akuma, Wenge... all of them were amazing in their own way. This wasn't a show about ping pong so much as it was a show about who they were. 
Seeing all these characters grow and learn was a wonderful experience. First, there was Wenge who lost and got knocked off his high horse. That was something, but even more so was when he got back up and set his mind to bettering himself with the support of his new team. 
Second, seeing Kazama go from the ""big bully"" to learning about why he did what he did. He wasn't just a gigantic a**hole who crushed people because it was fun. He had a REASON. His backstory showed how much pressure was on him to win. And, towards the end, he remembered how to have fun. That was a pleasure to see.
Third, and more of a minor thing, is seeing Akuma freed from his chains. His thought process was so single minded that he seemed to have forgot that there was more to life than just ping pong. It seems like a strange thing to say when so much of the show revolves around it, but he found happiness without a wooden paddle.
Fourth, learning about the character's backstories was handled exceptionally. Bits and pieces were sprinkled throughout the show, never overwhelming the viewer with one character at a time. And they were put in where they were needed most.
There was a unique reason for each of these characters to play. They had their flaws, their strengths, their friends, and their foes. There were ""main"" characters in Peco and Smile, but after seeing Wenge and Kazama and even Akuma develop as I talked about, they felt like just as big parts of the story as Smile and Peco.
But don't get me wrong, the culmination of the story was all Smile and Peco. The show did an incredible job of showing why they're such good friends. It's not because Peco talks a lot and Smile doesn't. It's because Smile was always pushing Peco from the shadows, rooting for his success because he liked seeing his friend happy. And Peco supported Smile by being there for him whenever he was needed. He was the ""Hero"" in Smile's life. 
Smile seemed like he was a robot. The joke from the beginning of the show was that he never smiled. Why was this? Why would a kid who seemed to be well off enough never smile? Why did he never go all out against his opponents when he was young? Those questions were presented and answered in a satisfying way.
Peco was also on a high horse. He didn't handle getting knocked down as well as Wenge, but the support from the old lady and Smile (although extremely indirectly) let him get back up again. Would he have done the same thing without his friends help? Who knows. The thing is, he had those friends to push him. 
Among those interactions, the psychological aspect of the show was incredibly strong as well. Questions like ""Why do we play ping pong?"", ""Who do we play for?"", ""Is it about having fun or being the best?"" caused me to think throughout the entire season and those questions were reflected individually with each character. 
Kazama played because he NEEDED to be the best. He had no alternative. 
Akuma played to become like Kazama. He wanted to be that good.
Wenge played because it was his escape. He wanted to go back home.
Smile played because he liked seeing Peco succeed. 
Peco played... because it was fun. 
On to the art. Some people might have turned away from this show because of the artstyle. I'm incredibly sad at this realization because a show's art style doesn't determine how good it is (see: Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Aku no Hana). It's a shame so many people are so ingrained in how anime is ""supposed"" to look that they can't see the beauty of a different style.
And this show managed to be beautiful. The art direction, the color changes, the subtle and drastic shifts in tone showed what good directing can do. An art style doesn't have to be the prettiest in the world to be the best. There are other ways art can take shape. 
Continuing on, the way the art was used throughout the story was truly unique. Giving the characters their own ""avatars"" in a way, the animators were able to create scenes that added immense value and emotion to some of the scenes where the characters are simply playing ping pong. Dragons, planes, heroes, robots... if someone heard this show out of context, they might think it was an action show. 
The soundtrack was always top notch as well. The opening? Fantastic. An amazing visual and auditory sensation combined into one powerful opening song with lyrics that reinforced the idea of having fun. It was always changing too. From episode to episode, it matched the mood and the tone, even if it seemed silly at times. 
Story was a bit lower than the others because honestly the story was in the characters. At a base level, it can be described as ""Ping pong players try to compete for the world championships"" but to leave it at that would be doing a huge disservice to the show. The characters made the story. 
I can't express how much I enjoyed this show. After I let it sink in I'll know a bit better, but I'm pretty sure it's my favorite of all time now. Every week I was dumbfounded at how a show about ping pong could be so overwhelmingly awesome. The answer is that it wasn't just about ping pong. It was about the characters as well. 
What I'm going to take away from this show is that ping pong, as well as all sports, is about having fun. If you focus on winning all the time, you're going to feel hollow and empty inside even if you DO win. And sometimes, we all need a reminder that having fun is the most important thing.
Even with all its slight flaws I give Ping Pong the Animation a 10/10. The rating says 10 is a masterpiece and I could not agree more with that. If I ever find out how to write to the author of this manga/the studio that made this show I'm going to express my enjoyment and my thanks. They did something utterly amazing.
Ping Pong, you were truly a show that was enjoyable above all others.

                Ping Pong, a sport that is played on a table. Who knew it could be so compelling when transformed into anime form? At first glance, this show seems like an unattractive piece of work with its oddly drawn looking characters. But thatâs only the surface as the complexity of Ping Pong the Animation is more about the animation style. Itâs about craftsmanship of a game that revolutionized with in an avant-garde way that is captivating, thought provoking, and mutation from unique to convincing work of art.
The show makes its entrance fairly straight forward with the competitive sport of ping pong. I am not an active
                  competitor of the sports myself but the show has the ability to grip your attention with its idiosyncratic style. And despite how complex the characters look at first glance, the story itself is easy to follow. We have two friends sharing a passion for the sport they love, in this case being ping pong. Makoto Tsukimoto and Yutaka Tsukimoto are fine examples of how people compete for success yet seemingly adapts to their love for a hobby. With nicknames such as Smile and Peco, they stand out fairly solid with their personas. 
Besides that point, several distinctive features stands out to make this show memorable. First, we have Masaaki Yuasa, the brainchild behind the show. With his innovative craftsmanship, he compels this show into an enthusiastic style series as previously seen in animation works such as Kaiba, The Tatami Galaxy, and Mind Game. Here, we see his talents again formulated into the world of ping pong, a competitive game that tests the very wits of the competitors. Each superlative movement is carefully made to stand out distinctively to show precision. But more so, we also see motifs whether itâs comparisons to those of a robotic arm or dragon as a form of symbolism of definable nature. 
The first episode shows how Peco meets a prodigy named Wenge (also nicknamed as China from the country of his origin). Coming from the âkingdom of ping pongâ, we quickly see the gap of strength in the two as China dominates in his match with a clean finish. But behind those devilish eyes and hot-boiled temper is also a man of integrity, who strives to become the best. His complex nature is a highlight in this show that feature several sides to his testament. For one thing, he seemingly has both an inferiority and superiority complex. From the beginning, he looks down on other players for attempting to be on his âequalâ such as Peco. On the other hand, he also values players such as Smile as someone that is worthy of being his adversary. And indeed, later episodes shows exactly why Smile is worthy of being called just that. Speaking of which, our main characters Smile and Peco are like columns to the building blocks of characterization. The way Ping Pong the Animation depicts their characters at a fundamental level is appreciable. For instance, Smile is portrayed with characteristics that shows him as a loner and plain man. Throughout the series, itâs shown that he is skilled in the art of ping pong and can be relatable with his realistic style of living life itself. He is honest, has a dynamic relationship with his coach, and even rivals takes him for granted. And despite often behaving in a deadpan manner, Smile can be quite likeable. His nickname also serves as an anti-thesis because he barely ever smiles with his expressionless face behind those eye glowing spectacles. On the other hand, we have Peco, a young boy of eccentricity. Unlike Smile, he is outgoing and is often on the lookout for challenges in his life whether theyâd be skilled competitors like China or dealing with countless hours of excruciating training. Even though he has a lack of skill compared to other players in the beginning, one should admire his never diehard attitude through a boy of determination. Pecoâs mentor, Obaba sees his honest intentions and pushes him to become what he hopes to be â a player of integrity of admirable efforts. Similarly, Jou Koziumi (nicknamed âButterfly Joeâ) values Smile for both his talent and someone that he sees as his younger self. This reflection in his character shows a visage that the show details in solidity through its intriguing characterization, one that is memorable from many angles. Likewise, all the main characters gets their spotlight and their journey to stardom. Itâs a ride you wonât forget with their development is what should be valued.
Of course, ping pong being a competitive sport also means competition. Itâs more than just hitting a ball with a racket across the table but rather as a form of art. Each movement requires a methodical play through strategic movements. Some of these are delineated with motifs and spellbinding moments thanks to Yuasaâs innovative style. The symbolism such as the ferocity of a dragon coming from Ryuuichi Kazama (also nicknamed as âDragonâ) shows this at its best during one of his matches in the tournaments. While it may seems like a wild frenzy, it also makes its point to show how intense ping pong can really be. Each competitorsâ playing style define their own characteristics and brings about their persona to life. The sportsmanship is also displayed well with accuracy to tell a riotous story. 
A controversial topic relates to the artistic direction of the show. One might interpret it as unfitting. Yet looking from a different angle, it should be seen as more the nature of how it is displayed. In this case, it is unorthodox but with a fitting edge towards its thought provoking story. The characters are presented as complex by nature, complex by attributes, and complex but their playing style. As such, we see this from the artwork of Ping Pong. The way the ping pong ball is hit forward and returned is captured with very fluid animation. The camera angle often focuses on each and every movement in order to illustrate the intensity of the game with hardcore precision. Thereâs no rush towards the art but instead serves as a purpose of the characters being figures to remember. The artwork in this case is memorable not for its avant-garde style but for the ability to bring out ping pong at its very best. 
Similarly, the soundtrack is also powerhouse that is carefully crafted to fit the characters and the ping pong world. For instance, the OST is intense often configured in rhythm to match each movement with a playersâ stroke. The voice actors also show their talents in their field especially for Chinaâs character. As a foreigner and fresh face, he is able to speak both Mandarin and Japanese to solid degrees. I give praise to Yosei Bun for his performance as his debut in the voice acting industry. However, China is not the only character with memorable dialogues. Most if not all the charactersâ dialogues are a testament to define how this show stands out to be complex in nature. Their dialogue holds meaning, depth, and dedicates to purpose. Likewise, Smile and Pecoâs voices also reflects their personalities in a credible way. Finally, the OP & ED song are more just than catchy. They systemically define the dynamics of its artistic style with appreciable freshness. 
Ping Pong the Animation is a brilliant example based off the manga of the same name that serves as a rare breed to the sports realm. While most sports series captivates on the competitions itself, this show seizes every moment to characterize its players that will be memorable for generations to come. It is mature, realistic, relatable, and compelling. The one aspect I did find somewhat vague and may seem weakly portrayed would be the rules of the actual games. But likewise, this is a story not just being about to beat the man but to be the man. As complex as the characters look, this show is easy to understand with a cunning nature. Even if you feel the final result of their achievements may seem indifferent, itâs what their journey that counts the most with the development. After all, thereâs an old saying that goes âthe journey is more important than the destinationâ. And after watching Ping Pong the Animation, I couldnât agree more.",9,Stark700

                By the sixth time the characters talked about how talented and brilliant Tsukimoto is, I had to make sure I wasnât watching a battle shounen series. At least the observers in Medabots looked anxious and worried. Ikki fought against tough enemies and had to find chinks in their armor. Here, Tsukimoto hits the ball a few times, push up his glasses and walks away. Not smiling did not add depth to the character.
Thereâs a brilliant story here somewhere. The story follows a cast that each has a different approach to the sport. This is an archetype that gives you so much do it never gets
                  old. Often, the series understands how to use it. There are about five different viewpoints here. Each is unique in its way, and each is presented as reasonable. The creators never rely on caricatures. They rely more on super-talented protagonists and an unorthodox art style that adds nothing.
Tsukimoto and Peco are both talented people who we are supposed to cheer for because theyâre talented. While Pecoâs lively energy is fun, itâs not enough to drive a main character. Itâs barely a quirk for a supporting one. Tsukimoto is supposed to be unique with how he refuse to smile, but his character never settles on pretentious moron or angsty teenager. Both wouldâve been fine, but at best the series makes him the former. It also takes his pretense seriously.
There is nothing exciting or valueable in being unenthusiastic about life. Tsukimoto walks around with an apathetic expression and doesnât seem to like anything. His attitude towards life is the same thing that made Joy Division successful, but Joy Division didnât just sell indifference. They explored that attitude.
People who reach such a state probably have something in the past that made them this way. They would also lead terribly dull and sad life. The idea that such a person can be so talented is far-fetched. Wouldnât winning games require some sort of drive? People sometimes hate what theyâre good at, but thatâs at least an emotion. Ping Pong wants us to believe that a walking embodiment of Joy Divisionâs classic album is somehow a champion in table tennis.
A bullying story is tacked on at the end. Itâs a predictible story that shows us that the kid was disliked, but never the horrible reality of it. Tsukimoto even gets a cheerful person to stick with him. Both of them turn out to be extremely talented in ping pong. Whereâs the struggle?
Peco faces losing for the first time and gets bummed, but this is where their troubles end. Theyâre celebrities and heroes in the eyes of everyone, but not heroes that are uncomfortable in their position. Theyâre not like Kazama, who was driven to succeed to cover up his emotional troubles. Kazama is a champion who uses victories as a way to find happiness that he canât achieve. His talent is part of his struggle.
Ping Pong also has a strange view of talent. Talent is something you either have or donât, and no amount of practice can make up for it. Itâs a fatalist view, and not a good one. It could be talent is something youâre born with, but how will you know if youâll never try to prove it? Indifference like Tsukimotoâs rarely produces noteable people.
Whatâs thrilling in such stories is not to see the characters win. All the creators have to do is just write that the characters won. Whatâs interesting is their struggle, their view on victory and why theyâre doing it. Their reaction to losing or winning is what makes things exciting. China, Sakuma and the long-haired dude all have such an arc. One uses the sport to return back home. One uses it to lift up his own low self-confidence. Another one is on an eternal search for meaning.
Their stories are far more exciting and humane than Tsukimotoâs/Pecoâs. They are stories of people like us, rather than two people who found out theyâre talented. Itâs amazing how similar it is to cookie-cutter heroic stories. Substitute âtalent in ping pongâ with âmagic swordâ, âvictoryâ for âsaving the worldâ and it turns out the anime isnât so unique as it looks.
How it looks is a big discussion point, but not that exciting. The only good thing about it is how unorthodox it is. The character design is a weird take on realism that looks grotesque without bridging the gap. What especially sticks out are the lips, which look huge. The sketchiness also makes the character design inconsistent. In too many scenes, the characters look like blobs.
This is not minimalism. They look like shapes drawn in a few seconds. The roughness achieves nothing. It could be an expression of the characterâs imperfection, but the story disagrees with that. Peco and Tsukimoto are heroic champions. It doesnât achieve any type of warmth because itâs too stylized and distant. All the rough lines and emphasized lips donât give it the elegant simplicity that saved Mushishiâs character design. Being different is great, but if it doesnât contribute to the story itâs just a fancy cover. Thereâs nothing particularly unusual about it other than a sketchy look that achieves nothing.
The animation is different, and Ping Pong fares better there. The series overcomes one of animeâs main flaws â its static animation. Most anime are fairly static, with more focus on design rather than motion. While Ping Pong fails in design, itâs a total success in kinetic energy. The Ping Pong matches are stylized action scenes that rely on visual expressions, not coherency.
Animating a sports match as it looks in reality is pointless. If you want to watch a real game, youâll watch a real one. The only reason we watch a sports story is because of what the sport means to the characters. Each match is animated with focus on its place in the character development. The matches are the same in what happens in them. They all consist of people hitting the ball. The difference between them is the meaning, and so every match is an engrossing action scene that leaves everything else in the dust. It doesnât just set the blueprint for how to animate sport scenes but how to animate action scenes in general.
Ping Pong is not the peak of anime. Itâs not even among the more unusual of its type. Despite trying to create its own rules, not enough of them serve the story and it falls back on sport prodigies. The exploration of that type doesnât go deep enough. Still, it has a great cast of side-characters and fantastic action scenes. Its attempts at understanding its cast are admirable, and so it relies more on developed characters than emotional manipulation. Itâs not a milestone, but thereâs enough to enjoy here.

                I remember a few years back, when I was discussing anime with someone in a year above mine at my school, that the discussion had turned to what we believed was the worst anime of all time. We discussed the usual that everybody brings up. Mars of Destruction, Boku no Pico as well as the then recently released second season of Tokyo Ghoul. As we kept discussing this topic, the other person, let's call him, ""Light Novel Trash Lover"" (as he kept telling me Infinite Stratos and SAO were the best anime ever made and he even came to school cosplaying Kirito a couple of
                  times, complete with the dual swords and everything; how the hell he was let in was beyond me) then brought up Ping Pong: The Animation as being one of the worst anime ever. Struck with both surprise and curiosity I asked him his reasons why, for, at the time, I had only seen three episodes and had really liked what I had seen. Light Novel Trash Lover then told me that, ""Ping Pong is the worst anime of all time because the animation and art style is terrible!"". And this little story sums up why I believe Ping Pong The Animation is so overlooked within the anime community, which is a shame too, since many are missing out on perhaps one of the greatest sports anime of all time, and one of the best in this past decade of anime. Of course, disliking an anime's art style is not inherently bad, but dismissing the entire show as being bad, based on the art style seems pretty silly. 
Regardless of such, Ping Pong, The Animation has recently become one of my favourite anime ever! It's a show less concerned about the sport, and more so a character study of its cast, filled to the brim with interesting and clever allegorical writing and symbolism, from one of the most critically acclaimed and respected directors working today, Masaaki Yusa! So let's grab our ping-pong bats, taste some of our blood (as it tastes like iron, y'know) and allow me to explain why I believe this show to be a masterpiece!
""The hero comes. The hero comes. The hero comes. Chant these words in your mind, and I'll surely come to you..."" 
Reciting these lines in his mind, one of our protagonists, nicknamed Smile, fights on in each and every one of his ping-pong matches, along with his friend, nicknamed Peco. Both boys have grown up together, bonding ever more closely over their shared passion for ping pong and, after growing older and reaching high school, both begin to play in tournament matches. The show sees them both grow, not only in their ping-pong abilities and skills but also more so as people as well, as they influence the players who go against them, who, in turn, also have their own mental hang-ups.
Ping Pong's narrative, if anything, will not surprise you with any grand plot twists, and is, at its most fundamental level, a standard sports narrative. However, what makes the show shine so much is its well-developed cast of characters, symbolism and amazing directing. Another thing that helps to make Ping Pong so much fun to watch from an entertainment perspective alone is how well paced the entire show actually is. The narrative is always pushing forward in some way, introducing new plot threads and mental dilemmas for its characters while also wrapping up several older ones at the same time, keeping the anime fresh and interesting. Another thing that makes this otherwise standard story so great is the how attached we become to both Peco and Smile as characters, generating intrigue from the audience, and many of the ping pong matches are exciting to watch since the narrative does a good job at creating narrative stakes and tension. The best example of this is the match between Weng and Kazama, where, if Weng loses this match, he will not be able to return to his home country of China, which makes the proceeding absolute beatdown of his character in the match all the more emotionally gripping. The entire show is just very tightly written, with visual symbolism and motifs as well as well developed themes and ideas, used in many cases in order to convey more about the characters and what they're feeling without the use of dialogue to masterful effect, which I will be getting more into in a moment.
The crux of the show is certainly the relationship between Peco and Smile, and how each one of them develops throughout the course of the show.  What's particularly interesting about their relationship is the juxtaposition of their personalities. Peco is rather upbeat, cocky and is highly motivated to become the best in ping pong while Smile is much quieter and is referred to as being a robot with no emotions by his peers and the people who go against him in matches. In fact, his name, Smile, was given due to him rarely smiling (which we later learn was actually given to him by Peco after seeing how much Peco enjoyed playing ping pong as a kid). 
Smile's character is all about learning how to enjoy the game of Ping Pong once again and break away from the robotic play style and mould he has been using for many years. The reason as to how Smile achieves this is through Peco's involvement in his life. Thus Peco is Smile's hero; the salvation he needs to enjoy the sport he holds so dearly once again, which results in some fantastic cathartic pay off at the end of the series. The motif of the hero, as well as the idea of flight,  is a consistent theme in the show and is used often to convey how characters are feeling too, with the depiction of a hero with wings being the representation of Peco. During the final match between Peco and Smile, as Smile begins to break free from his robotic play style, we see an image of a bird flying freely through the sky, representative of Smile's newly gained freedom. 
Peco's energetic play style and massive love for ping pong end up being the salvation of other players too, in particular, to Kazama, who had devoted his entire life to a strict training regime in order to win at ping pong and to further his career. However, his constant winning also leaves him isolated and secluded, as he frequently finds comfort in hiding in bathrooms before playing a game. In the penultimate episode of the show, we see visual imagery of the hero, in other words, Peco, extend a hand to Kazama, before taking it back and smiling at him. Kazama then grows wings himself, and flies after the hero, looking down at the bathroom he used to hide in signalling that his character has indeed grown, and he is now able to enjoy ping pong once again, reflected in his changed attitude in the game he is playing. 
More evidence that Peco is indeed Smile's hero comes from the line ""Iron tastes like blood"" which I referenced a little earlier in this review. The idea is that iron and blood are two juxtaposing elements, both representative of the contrast in personalities between the two characters. Blood is something that is alive, something that is moving, representing life, thereby linking into the idea that Peco is a hero and plays ping pong because he loves it, while the iron, which is associated as being cold and metallic is representative of Smile's character and play style. The idea that Peco tells Smile that ""Iron tastes like blood"" could be seen that Peco is trying to make Smile see that he is more human than Smile, and everyone else, believes. Another piece of symbolism used to contrast their characters are the use of the star and the moon, both typically found on each respective person's item of clothing or on their ping-pong bats. The star is used to represent Peco, always full of life and shining brilliantly, illuminating everyone around him, fitting into the hero motif, while the moon is used to represent Smile, an object that has two sides to it: the dark side and the light side, representing the change that is going to take place in his character.
Some clever visual imagery is used in regards to Peco's character when he throws his bat into a river, which has the star symbol on it, signifying that Peco's light and ambition is now no more. And there are plenty of these visual motifs in this show, all of which are used to showcase or add onto characterisation, making for some of the most interesting characters I've seen before in any show, most of which are rather relatable which drives the emotional weight of the characters even more. Each theme and motif in ping pong is integrated into the narrative in order for us to learn more about the characters. Take, for example, the motif of the butterfly in regards to Smile's coach, Koizumi, or the theme hard work being crushed under natural talent in the case of Sakuma in his match against Smile. 
Ping Pong also has one of my all-time favourite soundtracks with each track fitting the theme and personality of a character perfectly. The opening is damn great and never fails to get me pumped up while, at the same time, sprinkling in some lyrics relating to the motif of flying in the show. Peco's theme is fast paced, frantic and fun, mirroring his character and the motif of a hero, and is used to fantastic effect during his match with Kazama. In contrast, Kazama's theme is foreboding and powerful, representing Kazama's strength, which is used amazingly during his match with Weng, that I briefly touched upon before. 
I'd also like to use this match as an example of how great and imaginative the animation can be at times too. As previously mentioned, this match has a lot of narrative stakes since it is the final chance for Weng to get back into China after being kicked off the Chinese team, so as an audience, we sympathise more so with him, and want him to succeed. However, what follows, is an utterly hopeless beat down, and the entire match feels helpless. Just as much as Weng is feeling desperate, so do we an audience member, and the anime conveys this feeling of helplessness with fantastic visuals of Kazama towering over Weng, signifying their difference in skills and talent, as the ping pong table itself stretches out, emphasising this idea. Not only that but every time Kazama hits the ball, a streak of purple lighting is used to convey the power and lighting fast reflexes Kazama retains. In addition, we also see him depicted as being a giant, again, referencing his raw strength, but also the colour used is important as well: purple. In Ping Pong, the colour purple is used to represent those respected in the world of ping pong, as both teachers of Peco and Smile frequently wear shirts with some shade of purple and the highly influential academy Kazama attends is also largely purple. 
Taking this idea of purple, and applying it to this situation, makes for an interesting idea when we see Kazama transform into a giant purple dragon. Dragons are typically associated with Chinese culture, the place where Weng is trying to get back to, and having Kazama transform into a dragon is symbolic of his team who turned their back on them and the idea that he will never reach them ever again. The use of the purple signifies that they're respected in the world of ping pong, and the lack of any purple on Weng represents the idea that he will never get there again. 
The entire show is loaded with this much visual imagery and creative metaphors and is so insanely dense that it would be impossible to talk about it all, which is what makes the show so insanely well crafted and interesting to watch for anyone who loves creative animation. The animation as a whole is incredibly fluid and, at times, rather bouncy and energetic. I also love the art style too, albeit, if it can sometimes look jarring or wonky at times; it was never enough to pull me out of the overall experience, however. 
When it comes down to it, Ping Pong is a hard series to summarise and talk about because of how dense and how well constructed everything is. I could go on forever about what I personally think the show is trying to say and what each element represents, but I believe part of the fun of this show is trying to piece and make sense of everything for yourself, and if there is anything of what I said, you think is misinterpreted or just flat out wrong, please feel free to tell me. After all, all the analysis is just from my mind. Ping Pong The Animation is a marvel. A great example of what can be accomplished in animation and a true testament that a simple idea can become a wonderful show. Its characters are very well developed and the allegorical meaning behind what each represents are interesting, the music is fantastic, and overall, this is one of the best experiences I've had with a show ever. With that all said and done, thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I'll leave you with my favourite quote from the show:
""We're alive, and that's why we're happy...""",10,LIQfilms

                (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)
Heroes are the stuff of legend. They can prevent natural disasters to protect the Earth, fight giant monsters to defend a city, and even rescue people from unsightly doom. Heroes are who we call for when the going gets tough. They do what nobody else can, and that is, simply put, save. And it doesn't have to come from stopping an earthquake or beating up evil; what they do better than almost anyone else is instill hope. That, no matter what may come next, there is still a chance. And sometimes -- very rarely -- the heroes are
                  the ones who need saving. With this in mind, Ping Pong The Animation becomes an anime that goes down in history as one of the best.
STORY
Ping Pong stars two high school table tennis players, ""Smile"" and ""Peco."" One day, their club's coach sees latent potential in Smile, and begins to nurse him into the type of player he can assuredly be.
One of Ping Pong's greatest story elements, like the paddles the cast wield, is double-sided. It weaves in and out of the lives they live and the matches they play. That is, the characterization comes from their normal, everyday routines, but their development explodes from the battles they share. It's a constant turnover of seeing the characters adapt or react to the victory or loss they experience. It makes everyone involved incredibly dynamic and real. Watching Smile hold back due to misplaced drive, seeing Dragon dominate the playing field because of unimaginable practice, viewing Akuma as he faces reality; these few instances are tense and filled with drama. But it doesn't stop there. Because what happens afterwards is just as important: Smile becoming ruthless, Dragon remaining isolated, and Akuma correcting his path. In short, every match counts. The winners and the losers never leave the mats unscathed, and Ping Pong demonstrates this beautifully.
An interesting theme that the anime runs with early is the idea that ""there is always someone better."" A normal mindset looks at this adage as dealing with victory and defeat only; that being ""better"" is restricted to whatever topic is at hand. For Ping Pong, it elaborates beyond just winning and losing. For example, Yurie has two loves, but follows the one that brings her the comfort she desires. Koizumi is given a distinct opportunity, and leans towards the more moral path. Being better than someone isn't always about who earned the most or least points. Here, it comes from the actions -- not the numbers -- that the characters make. Kong training others or Akuma physically and mentally saving Peco make them ""better"" than the cold Smile or distant Dragon, despite the latter being ""better"" themselves.
Which links back to the introduction. Who is a hero? The word is used frequently, and is attributed to a fantastical creature with a strange gesture and elegant wings. Does it have to be some fictional entity? Like the story-telling and superiority discussed earlier, Ping Pong thinks outside of the box. A hero is the best friend, a rival, or some passing stranger. A hero is a coach or family member. A hero is one's self. That is, everyone is a hero. People have the opportunities to be the savior that somebody needs. And a lot of the time, they cannot always be capitalized on. Ping Pong shows this with Yurie and Dragon, or even Kong and his teacher. But when the hero does show up, it both figuratively and literally changes the game. He or she doesn't have to necessarily enact some elaborate plan. Whether it is training someone day and night or giving a small piece of wisdom, there is and always will be a hero in all of us.
ANIMATION
The most controversial topic when it comes to Ping Pong is in the art and animation department. And it is crucial to make a distinction between the two.
From the outset, the art is, bluntly put, ugly. It's literally rough around the edges and characters can have misshapen figures at any given time. But this is part of the allure, the ""charm,"" that it exudes. Over time, one gets used to seeing the characters looking wonky or the backdrops lacking detail. Essentially it is the only barrier keeping the audience away. If anything, it's extremely unique -- at least, within the realm of anime.
To alleviate some of these issues, Ping Pong takes on two rather clever approaches. The first is presenting everything in a comic book style. Shots are segmented in such a way as to ""show motion without motion."" Many scenes are broken up into panels: just a character's head, his feet planting, then an arm being swung, etc. But it's more than just cutting down on animation; it actually ties back into the themes of the show itself. It's a story containing heroes. And so what one is getting isn't just an anime, but a moving, talking comic book.
Another of its brilliant artistic choices is similar to the previous style. Table tennis is a personal game. Like chess or wrestling, it's a one-on-one test of skill. To this end, Ping Pong loves to place its characters in two separate, large panels when they are having a conversation. It mirrors the give-and-take of the sport they all play. And this doesn't just happen during the matches; it also occurs during their daily life, demonstrating how great of an influence the game has had on the lot of them.
The character designs are nicely done, and help to exemplify what each man represents: calm, sly, fun, cool, and strong. Smile with his plain looks and glasses, Akuma with his slanted eyes, Peco and his bowl-cut, Kong with his slick hair and shades, and Dragon's stoic facial details. Each player looks, and plays, the part.
As for the actual animation, Ping Pong is all over the place. At times, it flows nicely, and at other moments, it dips dangerously low. Again, the composition of the shots helps to relieve some of the more blatant issues, giving the anime an all-around average showing in movement.
CHARACTERS
Ping Pong contains a strong cast of characters, some of the best in a long while.
Akuma is a member of the Kaio Academy table tennis club. His rough attitude and unfriendliness makes him a difficult person to approach. As a child, he looked at Peco as an inspiration, and as a teenager, the mighty Dragon. He saw these great figures before him, and his goal was set: to become the kind of player his heroes had been known to be. But he faced a harsh reality, that sometimes, despite how hard one works, it just isn't enough. A certain amount of talent is needed to make the transition from good to masterful, and Akuma learns this the hard way. But his experience allows him to flourish. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, he becomes a savior for the people he had always looked up to. And eventually he realizes that just because his life may not have gone down the initial path he walked, there is still more out there to cherish and love even when the future looks bleak.
Kong Wenge -- also known as ""China"" -- hails from the land of the same name as the moniker given to him. Being foreign, cocky, and good at the game depicts him as a powerful opponent for anyone to face. More so than anyone else, he had to meet expectations. Representing his home country, abandoning his mother, making his coach proud, and getting back to his former glory are all pressures exerted on him. He succumbs to them, but he takes defeat not as a final judgment, but as a means to start anew. He reconnects with his family, he adopts a nicer personality, and he starts to coach -- starts to be the hero -- for his own club. He discovers that it isn't just about pleasing others; it's also about pleasing yourself.
As the champion of the mats, Dragon is a ferocious monster when it comes to table tennis. His only goal is to win; he cares about nobody and nothing on his way to the top. Growing up, he was subject to mental abuse, that he was only worth as much as the trophies he earned. Losing his father and being essentially ostracized, he became isolated. Lonely and afraid, his only comfort came from the stalls in which he would dwell. Crushing player after player, he decides that there are no heroes, that the only person that truly matters is yourself. But in a stunning performance, he learns the truth. That there exist people who can do the impossible, who can reach the skies. That people really can fly.
Smile is so aptly named because he never smiles. As a child, he was often bullied, ridiculed for his robotic nature and the video games he played. But he always believed that a hero would save him, would reach out and take him to a place of happiness. As a teenager, Smile's robotic play-style and obvious talent made him into a fearsome juggernaut, whose rise through the ranks was unparalleled. Going from uncaring to stubborn in his determination, Smile uncharacteristically begins to play with unfettered will. However, it is all for a purpose: to repay the hero of his past.
Finally, no discussion about the anime can be had without Peco. Always looking to have fun and eating way too many sweets, he prides himself on how good of a player he has always been. But what quickly comes to light is that he is no match for everyone around him, specifically Akuma, Kong, Dragon, and Smile. He finds himself everywhere emotionally, from soaring highs to drowning lows. But in the end, it is Peco who is the ultimate hero. Because he alone influences each of the cast. To Akuma, he was the kid everyone wanted to be; to Kong, he shows that people can improve; to Dragon, he signifies that heroes do exist; and most of all, to Smile, he proves that Smile is alive, is human, that Smile's ""blood tastes like iron."" Peco touches the hearts and minds of these men in one way or another, giving them all the opportunity to become the type of people they always wanted to be.
SOUND
The OP is quite good. With the yelling and whistling, the fast paced lyrics, and rock-n-roll instruments, it's not only very catchy but gets you quickly pumped up.
The ED takes some time to grow, but once it does, it is very powerful. It starts off soft, with the clapping and wavy, up-and-down sound effects. When the beat kicks in, it turns into both a happy and hopeful piece. And it ends like the birds in the sky: out of reach and free.
The soundtrack for the anime is amazing. ""Peco"" perfectly captures Peco's passion and love for the game with its flute and peppy feel. ""Butterfly Joe"" is sorrowful, with the violin and piano being emotionally resounding. The best track is easily ""Dragon,"" with its choir chanting, thunder, and hard drums; it is both incredibly mysterious and strikingly powerful. Every track either fits where needed or leaves a lasting impression.
Voice acting sees above-average work for everyone involved, with each cast member bringing about a splendid performance. Special shout-outs go to Fukujurou Katayama in his first VA role as Peco, Yousei Bun as Kong for the Chinese dialogue, and Shunsuke Sakuya as Dragon.
ENJOYMENT
There were so many events, and entire episodes, that were momentous to see. Kong versus Dragon of episode four, the Christmas Eve depiction of episode six, and all of episode ten were fantastic experiences that I can still picture in my mind. The development of the characters, the art direction, and the story itself; there are so many instances within the show that are memorable.
And that speaks nothing of the writing, too. Smile telling Kong, ""It'll only end in defeat,"" Peco screaming out, ""I'm fly--"" only to hit the water before finishing his sentence, or Smile telling his coach that, ""Heroes have no weaknesses."" There are so many great lines that can be pulled out from the anime, all of which not only sound cool out of context, but have such huge connections to the themes of the show itself.
Ping Pong The Animation has it all. A heartfelt story, a unique and purposeful art style, unbelievable characters, top-notch sound-work, and more enjoyment than one will know what to do with. This anime serves as testament to the idea that ping pong isn't just a sport; it's a way of life.

                Once finished ping pong the animation the first thing i had to do is write this review to help any person who has the slight thought of watching this anime not to do it. It's awful and THE ONLY REASON someone should see this anime is to fill his own anime list, that's the only thing this anime is worth for. 
- Story (3/10): Is not that different from others sports anime, both main protagonists smile and peko are pretty good on ping pong, they sign up to the spring tournament in which they both fail, so, they train for several months until
                  the next tournament comes up and they win, very standard.  
- Characters (1/10): Every character is a copy-paste, all of them are extremely cocky and arrogant until of course... they lose a match, suddenly their attitude change 
to a more pleasant attitude. THIS IS BS, you can't even consider this as character development, happens to literally every important character on the anime so you get tired of this very soon. 
About the main character smile, he is a kid on an emo phase in which doesn't show any emotions with the catchphrase that he only plays for fun and whenever he's about to lose he just activates the robot mode making him almost  impossible to beat... basically his hidden talent but yet, halfway through the anime he realizes how good he is and then he turns as cocky and arrogant as the other characters making really hard to empathize with him. 
- Dialogues (1/10): First of all, if you going to watch this anime and you have no clue about ping pong whatsoever, I'm sorry for you because only awaits you lot of jargon and technical words about different types of techniques, play styles, serves, types of rubber and rackets... So, you keep watching the anime without any idea of whatever they are saying or pause it and do a research on google about what they are talking about.  
Separately, the dialogues between characters is very poor and not realistic at all, most of the time they just chit chat no sense, neither plot related. If not, the conversation becomes a bragging competition in a way or another you can easily tell that this is a very low effort to fill because of the short story-plot that this anime has. 
- Art-style ~ Animation (1/10): This is by far the worst of all, awful, I understand that they wanted to be loyal to the manga art style since it's different, but making something different doesn't mean it's good, even less this type of art-style on a sports anime. In conclusion, what you get left are really poor animated matches since they are not fluid at all, the movement seems very rusty and at the end it feels like watching a PowerPoint with gifs of two guys bouncing a ball for 4-5 times alongside a ping pong ball sound effect. Once someone scores the score-board suddenly raises to 6 so if you somehow managed to enjoy the match it won't last for very long because every match lasts in between 15 seconds (less relevant) to 3-4 minutes as much... only excluding ONE match, the semifinal. And that was the good part, the way they animated the fill training episodes it's way worse. A bunch of really really really low-quality art designed characters as background while seeing just recycled animations and moves episode after episode makes you want to go to sleep and drop the anime instantly. 
- Overall (2/10): The only good thing I could say about the anime is the fact that I didn't expect who was going to be the winner of the last match on the tournament and caught me by surprise, anything but that it's just legit garbage. This is a bad anime, you can tell instantly, even if you rate it high or low, this is an overrated anime which you will forget in a couple of days. It does not mark or affect you at all like other animes. Even once you finish it you can't really have a discussion or a conversation about this anime... because nothing interesting nor entertaining happens. This is not an anime you want to recommend to someone, even if he's new to anime or someone who has seen 400+ animes, because this anime... It's just a WASTE of time. Poor Story-line, awful characters/dialogues, the art-style and animation it's beyond horrendous... 
Avoid watching it.  
Every feedback is very helpful... Thanks!",2,Linsf

                'Ping Pong the Animation' is an absolute masterful work within its animation medium. When taken out of context, this statement is bound to sound silly. What kind of story, that is based around table tennis, would people consider 'masterful'? Quite honestly, I saw little potential when reading the synopsis. And boy was I proven so very, very wrong.
I was fully aware that Yuasa Masaaki is the director, the man responsible for Tatami Galaxy, Kaiba and several other creative works. Admittedly, I have not read any of Matsumoto's work despite knowing his solid reputation, so my expectations were more so lost than low. But low nevertheless.
                  And for those of you who are put off to watch this, don't be. It looks to be several guys playing table tennis for the heck of it, but it's a mountain more than that.
Ping Pong isn't really about ping pong - rather the sport is used as a driving sport for characterization than the central concept. It's why people don't consider this as a 'actual sports anime', even though it actually is. It's just not your typical one, and a very non-conventional one at that. I don't particularly refer to the abstract art, which does indeed play a role, instead I refer to the careful yet unique approach towards several characters' development in a mere eleven episodes, by the means of ping pong itself.
For example, the foreshadowing at the beginning of episode one presents the quotes:
""Call me when you're in a pinch!""
""Say it thrice in your heart!
""Enter the hero!"" ""Enter the hero!"" ""Enter the hero!""
""Do that and I'll be there!""
In which the known 'hero' then sprouts out his wings and proceeds to fly in the air. Foreshadowing occurs a lot during the show, in various forms like symbolism, metaphors and actual events. But they aren't merely references to their past events. They reference the motivational drives and resolve the characters keep within them, which adds weight and depth to their character that connect table tennis to their lives. These moments of past references generally occurs in the actual table tennis matches, hence the efficiency to develop more than five characters in eleven episodes.
Why are they playing table tennis, and what for? The reasonings vary for player to player. Perhaps its the anxiety of losing reputation to merely passing on time. Or from misery in confinement to overcoming talent with effort. Each of the main characters have their ambitions and fears that molds the stages they go through. Majority of these characters' resolutions changes in the duration of the anime, but not in a morally typical way. The events attaches seemingly unrelated characters, and clashes their ideals to each other, similar or not, which changes the other player's mindset for the better or worst.
There's certainly more than one theme in Ping Pong, and thanks to the presentation that makes the anime so relatable to a lot of the audience. It deals with the balance of effort and talent within people. The bullying aspect is dealt in a fine manner that connects to humanity and equality. And then there's the metaphors, the central ones from heroes and birds flying, to the more straight-forward ones like dragons and robots. The most pronounced one though is, in Yuasa's words, ""the best thing to do is enjoy yourself.""
Ping Pong is commendable for adapting the entire manga into eleven episodes as a complete product, rather than animation advertisement like LNs. It hardly feels messy or convoluted, but this does lead to some unfortunate sacrifices. At times, it feels like characters change very suddenly, despite being justified. Other scenes are dragged out, specifically the texting scene in the last episode. The pacing is rapid and feels jumpy at times, but it is definitely solid and does not feel rushed to ruin the story at all.
The coming-of-age aspects of the writing also leaves an unfortunate cause. Some characters begins unlikable due to their nature. Smile starts out stuck up and, with intentional irony, never actually smiles. Peco starts out pretty cocky whose only purpose is to win, and cries or goes drunk when things doesn't his way. Later on though, the entire cast develops and grows into better people, having their resolves and inspirations changed or realized that both justifies their previous actions and changes them into players that are admirable by the end. It feels simply satisfying to watch these characters grow and blossom with depth, themes and characterization.
The writing is not exactly straight-forward, and without convolution too. You are subjected to 'think' when watching the show; by, what the internet would like to say, 'turning off your brain', you'd be missing out a LOT of depth the animation has. You do need to figure out the inner themes and piece together the puzzles in order to fully appreciate the characters. And it's completely worth it. The anime uses lots of psychology and subtle symbolism, even though some themes are put forward more than others like the blood aspect and robotic feature. But it's because of this amount of depth the anime underlies that makes it so especially relatable and exquisite.
Animation is brilliant, and yet it's not. Art style is definitely non-conventional because of its abstract nature. This may be close doors for some, but open doors for others. The scheduling and budget, mostly the former, had hit a dead end. It's evidential to some bad 'quality' shots scattered around, some more apparent than others. Frame rate feels low and cluttered at times, but thankfully the prioritized matches and symbolism towards the end is given more fluidity and budget. If you can easily adapt to the abstract art style that heavily resembles the manga, then you are in for a real treat.
Both Yuasa's and Matsumoto's style absolutely stands out here. The problem with most adaptations nowadays is that they forget that anime and manga are two VERY different mediums, but Yuasa realizes this. With faithfulness, a lot of manga paneling is cleverly used in animation fashion. Other techniques include the velocity of pacing in matches - since anime is a set-timed medium and manga is not, expressionism in subtle symbolism and characters' body language, the ability to blend both realism and cartoon nature and so on. The exotic animation style allows accessibility to be creative, thus creating a product that goes all out in every single scene.
Table tennis matches are an absolute blast to watch at times. Simply because they look like table tennis matches, instead of shounen fest smashing attacks. The techniques, power and accuracy of every hit and miss makes it apparent that the animators has done their research into the sport. And, referencing what I mentioned earlier, the matches don't merely rely on the animation, but also the amount of depth and importance each win or lost has.
Sound direction also enhances the experience to a new level. From feet scratching to balls bouncing, every single sound effect creates an atmosphere that is both light lifting yet heavily substantial in its matches. The soundtrack is solid, bringing in tones from uplifting to intensity, and from the depths of hell to heavenly paradise. Every voice actor expresses their characters and brings the life out of them with the correct personality and tone. Cast includes Kouki Uchiyama to some new VAs, and a proper Chinese Mandarin VA to LotGH's narrator.
Overall, I loved Ping Pong the Animation. It's more personal love due to its relatable themes hitting close to home, and its 'show, don't tell' execution being most excellent throughout the course of the animation. This isn't merely a sports anime. It's one that pinpoints the nature and psychology of human beings, questioning the purpose of their lives and what WE can do to make the most of ours. Ultimately, the story shows us that life does indeed have a meaning, that instead of stressing ourselves to achieve something, we should strive to enjoy the sports, careers or hobbies we do that defines us.",9,tommy73

Ping Pong the Animation is certainly an underdog-style show. I went into this anime not expecting much. It had a bizarre art style and was adapted from a manga that's around twenty years old now. Yet this show quickly became one of my favorites this season and proved that it was probably this season's biggest underdog next to some of the more hyped shows. That actually fits this show perfectly since it's the story of an underdog. However, being an underdog in most people's eyes doesn't mean you're not the hero in someone else's.
It's pretty much impossible to talk about the story in this
                  heavily character-driven sports anime without talking about the characters instead. The show begins with a couple of disorderly ping pong players at a high school with no reputation in the sport. Smile and Peco seem like the strangest pair of friends you'll ever meet. Smile never smiles and Peco's a ball of energy with no off-switch. They're pretty much exact opposites no matter how you look at them. While I didn't find either of them to be very likable right off the bat, the show develops both of them incredibly through many flashbacks to their childhood as well as displaying their motivations in the present. The rest of the side characters are also well developed throughout the show. My favorite is the Chinese player Kong Wenge. This is one of the only shows I've ever seen actually use non-Japanese voice actors for foreign characters and it was a pleasure to hear. Kazama Ryuuichi is the favored player throughout the show and has garnered fame through his playing and his family. Despite his determination to get better at the sport and be the best, he doesn't really enjoy playing ping pong. The development everyone in this series experiences whether they are high school players, a coach, or other side characters is incredible. They do have faults especially in the beginning, but this character cast definitely shined bright at the end.
Now for the most controversial part of the show: the animation. This show uses a very experimental style which ranges from working perfectly with the feel of the story to just being awkward at times. For the most part it works excellently, but, especially during the ping pong matches early in the show, the animation is just distracting and poorly done. As the show goes on and the matches become more important, the animation improves, however some of the earlier matches consist of one repeated rally with nothing else shown. As for the many flashbacks, the show utilizes it's animation very well to give them an emotional feeling and to build up why you should care for these characters. While some of the flashbacks are used a little too much, they still have an amazing impact on the show and build the foundation for the characters. Especially for Smile and Peco, these flashbacks are really well executed.
The soundtrack for the most part is just there to set the mood and not much else. At first it mainly consists of background sounds and some instrumental tracks to go along with the more emotional and dramatic moments. Towards the end with some of the final ping pong matches, the soundtrack really stands out, especially in the second to last match played in the show. The ED theme is also something I'll mention since it is one of my favorite songs from any anime this season.
Ping Pong the Animation is the underdog anime of the season and with this exceptional character cast of heroes, underdogs, and fallen heroes, it really fits the show unintentionally well. I'm not really a big fan of sports anime, and if you are, you may not actually like how this show is done. That's not fact of course, I'm just mentioning it since this is more of a character-driven psychological friendship story than your typical sports anime. If you're looking for a show that focuses on the sport and the special techniques of it that most shows in this genre use, then you'll probably be dissatisfied. However, if you're just looking for something that gets inside of the characters' heads and analyzes their reasons for playing a sport and their motivations that drive them to continue, then this is something you'll probably enjoy.",7,Asfaria

                âThere's no shortcut to victory. You have to climb that steep mountain one step at a time. There's an abyss down below and it never ends. Your only choice is to keep climbing!â
-Ryuuichi Kazama
Iâm constantly impressed at Japanese anime writerâs abilities to bring life to any subject matter.  Whether itâs Go in Hikaru no Go or in the case of Ping Pong- The Animation, any game can turn from calculated and boring to an intense emotional battle between two opponents.  This anime was a coming of age story, displaying the very different lives of several table tennis players as they battled their own
                  inner demons while aspiring to rise to the top of their sport.  I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire series, and I was left with a great sense of fulfillment and joy at its conclusion.
The story in this anime is actually quite simple; two best friends Yutaka Hoshino(Peco) and Makoto Tsukimoto(Smile) are in high school together on the table tennis team.  Hoshino is the typical outspoken and bombastic teenager, and normally the dominant one at table tennis.  But all it takes is for a Chinese transfer student named Wenge Kong to recognize Tsukimotoâs superior skill and how he often holds back for the sake of Hoshino, and the whole story explodes open.  You end up following over the shoulders of six different high school students, all devoting their free time to table tennis, trying to become the best and win the Inter High tournament.  Between the superior Kazama and finding who he really played ping pong for, to Kong and his desires to reclaim his countryâs respect by excelling abroad, each story tied in nicely together.  
The amount of morals present in Ping Pong is uplifting to say the least.  As aforementioned in the opening quote, table tennis exists as a medium for the various characters to discover themselves and further their ventures as a teenager.  Whether itâs through a brutal butt-whooping in a match or by training or just learning to be free and love the game they devote so much time to, each story is unique in its own way.  I loved the relationship existing between Hoshino and Tsukimoto.  Hoshino was always there to stick up for his pal when they were younger, so Tsukimoto often held back when playing matches against him.  Eventually realizing he wasnât invincible, Hoshino slumped into a state of âfinding himselfâ, convinced that he was fine without playing table tennis, and it wasnât until he talked to an old and wise owner of his frequented spot that he snapped out of it.  It was such a profound transformation of character and an exciting one to watch unfold.
Ping Pong- The Animation creates more character development in 11 episodes that most animes can muster in three times the length.  It was absolutely remarkable.  Yukata Hoshino is one of the most refreshing characters Iâve come across in awhile.  His demeanor was so pompous but he had such a strong love for his sport that it was almost warranted.  The way he always stuck up for Tsukimoto was admirable, which made you develop an understanding for his personality.  Tsukimoto, being the calm and calculated nerd that he was, viewed table tennis as nothing more than one of his games heâd play on the subway each day.  The way he would adapt to other playerâs style just to crush them in the second game made his aura robotic.  I love that he was referred to as âSmileâ because itâs the one thing no one ever saw him doâ¦ that is, unless he was playing with Peco.  Unlike some interactions between MCs, Peco and Smileâs dialogue always felt naturalâ¦ almost like the entire conversation was improvâd.
Kong was an interesting character as well, being that he came off as such an arrogant, uptight foreigner.  However, as he lost his edge you began to feel sorry for him.  I didnât want to see him go back to his country a loser, but in the end I think he achieved a mountain of wisdom through his enlightening experience in Japan.  Kazama was kind of similar in the regard that you kind of feel sorry for him for giving his all to the sport, but he never really played it for himself.  Playing with Peco near the end of the series I think snapped him out of his internal dilemma and made him fall in love with the sport all over again.  It was a very humbling experience.
Of course, the art may be something that would critically receive a low score on most reviewersâ charts.  On the contrary, I feel that it fit the overall vibe of the anime quite well.  The sloppy, lazy drawings reminded me a bit of Mike Judge cartoons mixed with Shin Chan.  It added to the humor significantly, especially when the characters were far away.  Some of the action scenes were really well done, especially when it paned shots of the characters together.  I really loved the art in the opening though, the black and white effects in the beginning were cool to look at.  The music was fantastic as well.  The OP got me pumped up, and I actually never skipped past in throughout the series.  Some of the sequences involving the ping pong ball noises cascading over each other reminded me of being on drumline.  The sound editing was top notch.  When I was finished watching the anime, I looked up Pecoâs voice actor, Fukujurou Katayama and was astonished that it was his first voice acting role.  GET THIS GUY SOME MORE PARTS.  He was incredible.  The ED was nothing special, I found myself skipping it most of the time just because I was trying to binge watch the show faster.
This show kept me engaged from start to finish with its over-the-top action and diverse, interesting characters.  It was a âfunâ show, and one that made me laugh on multiple occasions.  I loved the reoccurring line from Peco, âitâs three centuries too soon for you to challenge me!â It illustrated his confident nature very well.  Iâm actually kind of glad it was only 11 episodes too, it didnât allow for me to think too far into its meaning or get bored.
Ping Pong was hands down the best sports anime Iâve ever seen.  The writers took what is seemingly a dull and repetitive sport to a whole new level of exciting.  It made me laugh at times, and think deeply intellectual at others.  No dialogue seemed wasted, and the character development was some of the best Iâve ever seen.  I canât recommend it enough!

                (This review is 90% Spoiler free. The 10% isn't really significant. So... )
""Who cares where a 2.7 gram ball goes..""
Refreshing and wonderful.
First and foremost, it must be made clear that this show does not care much about the 2.7 gram ball. It is something more. It rises above it's name as well as the norm of the anime industry of today and manages to become something unorthodox yet beautiful. 
STORY:
The story is one of coming-of-age. However, although the main focus is on the duo of Makoto Tsukimoto (""Smile"") and Yutaka Hoshino( ""Peco"" ), the story encompasses a sort of coming-of-age for almost all the characters
                  involved. That is what sets it apart. You could call it a character driven story. But, it doesn't use one or two larger-than-life characters to achieve it. Instead, the story is more of a collection of stories of various characters and their lives. Ping pong merely acts as a common thread to glue them together. We usually jump from scenes involving one charcter(s) to another as they struggle with the challenges that their ping pong life has thrown at them. However, as incohorent as that sounds, it is not so. It's perfectly directed and paced. Whether it's a flashback in the middle of a game or a short scene showing a particular character's status quo, nothing is misplaced. It feels entirely natural and smooth and elegant.  
And as mentioned before, ping pong is never in focus. Heck, they don't even spill out the rules or go through detailed explanations on the various aspects of the game. For eg: the intro goes like this, ""Makoto Tsukimoto (Smile): Right Shakehand Grip, Pips-In Rubber on Both Sides, Attacking Chopper"".  Shakehand Grip? Pips-In Rubber? Chopper? What do they mean? A character doesn't suddenly start saying,""The right shakehand grip is a popular grip where..."". NO! The show just says: If you want to know, just google it and let us focus on the characters instead. And in my opinion, that is how it should be. We as a viewer are inclined more towards questions like: why doesn't Makoto smile? What is Koizumi-sensei's motivation? Yes, it would be helpful to know a bit about the sport but if the time is better utilized on things like that then so be it. 
Also, the amount of realism is commendable. This is evident even in simple things like the draw of the tournaments. Significant characters face off in the third round or even the second round and not in the closing stages as is common in other sports anime. That feels more real to me.
However, having said that, the realism doesn't kill the entertainment. Watching the games is never ""boring"", not by a long shot. 
ART:
Honestly, 10 seconds into the anime, I was shocked. The animation is so different from the norm. It is scruffy and ragged and feels runny and edgy at the same time.
And the character design seems to have been made to look ugly. In fact, before I got used to it, they reminded me of certain titans of a certain show. 
However, after the first 10-15 minutes, I got used to it and I think most viewers will do too. It is clearly evident that the creators were not going for a ""realistic"" look which is the usual alternative to the normal art style. Instead, they chose this unique, artistic look. On retrospect, if the art style wasn't like this, the unorthodox feel of the show would have been almost completely lost. So, kudos to them. 
Sometimes, the screen is divided into panels in a manga-like manner (especially around match-times) for extra dramatic effect and it achieves that goal as well.
Also worth mentioning is the surrealistic art that is employed from time to time which feel very -for a lack of better term- ""artistic"". Abstract art is also used to depict the tide of the match instead of doing so through the gameplay. For eg: The size of an imposing player may be bloated out of proportions to establish the atmosphere of dominance. Or the art may convey the emotions of the players instead. 
All in all, it's a perfect fit for this show.
CHARACTERS:
Ok. This is where it gets epic.
Almost every character is properly handled. And again in only 11 episodes: Not only the two main characters, every freaking one of the side characters is very well developed by the end of the series. And this development is so very natural and smooth that you only realize it's significance when looking back after finishing the show. 
At the beginning, you have the mundane, emotionless, unmotivated and overly-considerate 'Robot' Smile, his best friend but complete opposite: the cocky and flamboyant Peco. And then, there is the Chinese Kong Wenge who needs to prove himself to end his exile from his homeland, the strict and focused Kazama Ryuuichi, the hardworking yet untalented Sakuma Manabu and many more characters who are molded in a certain way due to circumstances. They live in their own little worlds. Ping-pong is what brings those worlds together and makes them collide. As they interact with each other, whether it be as rivals, friends or acquaintances, they begin to change: as one by one they find their true self and come to accept the reality in front of them.
The other thing which is especially well-done is the portrayal of the characters themselves. The character development of the many characters creates a variety of feelings in the viewers regarding them. There are no characters tailor-made to be liked. You end up loving/hating each character almost equally. And so, you find yourself facing a dilemma whenever two of those characters face off in matches. You are well informed of both of their background, their motivation, their will to win and the work that they put into it. So, it is not as easy as simply rooting for the M.C as in other sports anime out there. In fact, in the beginning, I was seriously 
annoyed at Peco, and wanted him to lose to Kong when they first faced off. 
Sometimes, the match-up is between hard-work and talent. That also got me thinking about the point of working hard for those without the talent. Is it pointless? Is passion and will not enough? But that is just a secondary thought.
SOUND:
It was also surprisingly good. The sounds of dozens of bouncing balls in practice sesssions, the background music in matches, or silent mode for some converstations, all of them were good. The seiyuus did a fine job portraying the characters with their defining traits. 
As for the opening and ending songs, they were perfect for this show. The opening gets you really pumped up for the show while the ending is also pretty decent. They also slot in perfectly with the art style. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL THOUGHTS
The creators must be commended for taking a relatively old and decent manga and doing such a fine job of creating a great work which ticks all the right boxes in all departments. 
Highly recommended for anyone looking for something different/unique. 
Finally, a part of the lyrics of the o/p:
""Maybe there's no job I'm the only man for, but
 Will I fade away without doing anything?
 Will I fade away without doing anything?
 Like hell will I fade away without doing anything.""

                This is not a traditional sports show. If you're looking for a generic shounen sports anime, don't bother with Ping Pong. It transcends the genre, almost to the point of a deconstruction. Instead of focusing on the sport itself and the main character's fight to the top in said sport, it focuses on the playing of the sport itself, who plays it, why they play it, and what their motives and ultimate goals are. It also demonstrates a magnificent amount of personal crisis and searching for the understanding of one's self within the sport. Ping Pong the Animation is a fucking masterpiece.
If you don't play
                  sports, you may not understand the intricacies of the issues these characters deal with (not to say you won't), but if you do, you're in for a hell of a show.
Story:
The story is basically about a group of high school athletes from different schools, different backgrounds, different environments all competing to be the best at Ping Pong. This show is about each character's struggle to the top and how they find success. The story is heavily reliant on characters and seeing as not much happens that isn't spoiler, this is all the analysis you're gonna get.
The finale to this show is so good that I cried from the sheer magnitude of emotion emanating from each character. One of the best I've ever seen.
Sound: 
Excellent. The OP is incredible. The best of the year by far. The entire soundtrack is pretty much equally solid and always fits the mood perfectly.
Art/Animation:
If you want an idea of what the series is like, watch the OP and look at how much detail it contains. It is extremely unconventional, but it works.
The main gripe people have with the show right here. I don't understand the complaints at all. The animation is incredibly expressive, makes each character stand out in their own way, and hell, if nothing else, makes the series feel all the more unique than it already is. It makes everything look real and look like controlled chaos, very much what sports is for the most part. It's the perfect choice for the anime, there is absolutely nothing I wish changed in it.
Characters: (Warning, spoilers)
Now for the real meat of the show, the reason it's so fucking good. The characters. Not a single main or secondary character felt recycled. Each had their own distinct personality and look so you never confuse any of the characters with each other. 
Our main character, Tsukimoto, is very quiet, reclusive, and introverted. He really only has one friend, Peco, and he seems to not have a lot of passion about the sport whatsoever. This is problematic because he has the most potential out of any character introduced. His coach doesn't want to let him waste this potential so he tries to inspire him using any method possible. This ultimately leads to Tsukimoto agreeing to enter the high school championships where he hopes to face Peco and take him on in the finals. The imagery used with him is phenomenal. At one point he's locked himself in a classroom and you're given a still, black and white shot of him with these magnificently large, vibrant, orange butterfly wings demonstrating how his true potential is beginning to blossom from inside of him. Tsukimoto goes through incredible development, you can just feel the difference in his personality by the end of the show and you can see in how he plays his final match that he's truly better off than when he began. Peco is his literal hero who saves him. It is unclear to anyone what Tsukimoto truly wants and that's one of the most interesting things about him.
Now on to Peco. He's one of those kids that doesn't take anything seriously, goofs off a lot, plays to have fun, etc. But here's the catch: he hates to lose. He puts on a farce about not caring how he does, but when he gets floored by Kong Wenge, he shuts down and sinks into a shell of what he used to be, too depressed to play. He then struggles the entire series with a personal comeback, intensive trainer, and a character reform. He ends up overtraining and hurting his knee before the final match against Tsukimoto (Karate Kid style) and has to deal with added challenges that put him to the test. Throughout the series, Peco always struggles with wanting to be the best of all time, but not wanting to do what it takes to get there.
And now to Kong Wenge. He's the Chinese exchange student, sent to Japan because he wasn't good enough to make the Chinese national team. He's disgusted when he shows up to find that everyone their isn't very good (except Tsukimoto who refuses to play him), and has to deal with the fact that he's saddled to a bunch of losers for a year. He eventually gets beaten by Kazama and has to face the fact that he may never make it back to China and play ping pong ever again. He works his ass off to get back for the national championships to get back to China. His main motive is to go home and play for the national team.
Kazama Ryuuichi. The dragon. The unbeatable. The local hero. He's seemingly untouchable throughout the entire series, yet near the end, you start to realize how truly vulnerable of a character he is. He locks himself in the bathroom in the search of complete solitude before every tournament, he deals with not really wanting to be the best, but not really wanting to lose because it's the only form of respect he receives. He views ping pong as a cage in which he cannot escape. 
And here we have the last character I am going to talk about, Kekota. He's always lived under Peco's shadow, always looked up to him, but despised the way he never takes anything he does seriously. He works the hardest out of anyone, but never seems to get the results he desires. Tsukimoto has to break it to him that he's inherently bad at ping pong. It doesn't matter how hard he tries, he's never going to win because he's just not talented enough. He struggles to come to terms with this, but when he does, he's a completely different person. Everyone who plays sports or band knows someone like this. Someone who works so hard, but just sucks and it's genuinely depressing to watch, but it's put in an optimistic way so that the viewer never truly feels like they're watching someone's life shatter in front of their eyes (even though that's basically what happens).
Entertainment: 
This was honestly one of the most profound, impactful shows I've ever watched and one of three to make me cry (Zankyou no Terror episode 9 and Steins;Gate's entire second half lmao), but not due to sadness, due to pure understanding and revelation. Ping Pong is probably the most accurate representation of the realities of sports ever created.
Overall:
If you haven't watched it yet, just please do so. You can watch it for free, legally on YouTube, so start now, please.
As always, leave me some feedback on my review. Feel free to criticize, I won't care one bit.",10,0207xander

                Ping Pong: The Animation is one of the most astonishing anime Iâve ever seen. Itâs something that could only come out of passion and devotion from an eccentric auteur who prides himself in the unique and extraordinary. Only masters and madmen could produce works as tight and uniquely crafted as this. Itâs easy to see why this show is regarded as a masterpiece. Frankly, this anime deserves all the praise it gets.
Thatâs not to say it will appeal to everyone. The art style is rough. Thereâs no denying that. Itâs so rough that some may call it ugly, ignoring the stellar, often cinematic presentation and
                  wonderful comic book style Yuasa mastered in the process. Some will forego praising the character designs because of the artwork, unable to appreciate how deliberately presented the matches are and how lovely the colors and imagery can be. No two matches are ever the same, and the last two are particularly stunning. They may even write off the show as badly animated despite how well-animated everything is, simply because they donât like the drawings and because thereâs some CGI (a lot of which you may not even notice) and missing faces every now and then. Itâs a shame, but even if you find this Tatsunoko Production show ugly, Iâd implore you to endure it for the wonderful writing and adrenaline-pumping displays of games and drama permeating each episode. It looks better than youâd expect, and better than many give it credit for.
Accompanying the often-electrifying matches is the showâs OST composed by Kensuke Ushio. There are several engaging tracks that highlight the immense pressure each game instills on its players and the audience, effectively becoming memorable battle themes in the process. Iâm also a fan of the one electronic track that appears in some moments of preparation and speculation in the tournaments, as it adds to the anticipation the show already delivers in spades. The only other memorable song outside of a fun karaoke track in episode 6 and another insert song in the finale, would be the opening. ""Tada Hitori"" by Bakudan Johnny is a raw and fun track that encapsulates the determination and passion the showâs characters have for the game. The keyboard works perfectly with the guitar, drums, and manly vocals. 
Now to get to what youâre really here for. Ping Pong: The Animationâs character writing is frighteningly good. The show juggles several different character arcs in each episode, with said arcs and characters influencing and interacting with each other in meaningful and standout ways. This happens even when one characterâs arc concludes, such as with Manabu the âDemonâ who helps a former rival out of his downward spiral after being forced to re-examine himself and his own jealousy. The best part is that all of this is done in the span of 11 22-minute episodes. With such a tight story length and brisk pace, youâd think these character arcs would feel rushed or incomplete. Most of them do not and even those that do feel a tad rushed in places have such minor slip-ups that most people wonât notice or care. You can always see a logical start and end with every single point in each characterâs arc, whether that be Wenge Kongâs arrogance and desperation to prove himself to get back on his former team, or Smileâs change from a reserved, almost nihilistic drone playing to pass the time and find some fun in Ping Pong, to a tremendous machine whose ice is gradually thawed. This isnât even going over Pecoâs or Kazuma the Dragonâs arcs, which culminate in one of the best penultimate episodes I have ever seen.
Additionally, we learn about each characterâs playstyle and training regimens. Their backstories are presented with a certain amount of flair even early on before certain players suffer major losses. It avoids the pitfall of explaining everything about a characterâs backstory at a life or career-threatening moment, as we learn about them way before their most critical games expand on their backstories once and for all. On top of that, their character dynamics are filled with such vibrancy that these people would take on a life of their own through that alone. Theyâre all incredibly well-realized and tactile, so their journeys are electrifying. The way their arcs are delicately woven together adds even more chemistry and life to these characters, making their arcs all the more rewarding. Itâs because of this that the revelations and conclusions regarding each character in the back half are able to become some of the most hype moments Iâve witnessed all year. Every time a character resigns to his fate, itâs as powerful as a heroâs special move. Fitting given the motif that defines our main leads. I dare not say more. Just know that youâre getting a lot out of this cast in such a short period of time, and that the big matches this anime presents are as moving as some of the best anime fights out there. Thatâs why the writingâs so daunting and impressive.
Another aspect of this show that is incredibly intricate and tactile is the world. Exposition dumps about the major schools of Ping Pong are presented through advertisements and through characters trying to encourage our main protagonist âSmileâ to join their school. We get to see their training regimens, colors, ethos, and more through careful sprinkles of information or dazzling displays. Characters also often remark on strange fads and trends regarding delicacies like the sudden thinning of soda carbonation or these chocolate bar gimmicks that make the general populous unable to appreciate the basic $1 bar. Even minor characters that get defeated in one episode often get noticeable characterization to them to make this world become even more alive. My favorite example is this one character who is constantly looking for a place where he belongs. Long after he loses his match and he declares his next destination, you see him shifting from ping pong to the beach and then to the mountains, and so on. These are all small details, little touches that make this already vibrant anime even more lively. Nitpicks like the scores not accurately depicting what the anime is conveying regarding certain games, and a few character beats feeling rushed, arenât enough to take that away from this show.
Ping Pong is an anime that soars like few ever could. Assuming youâre not averse to the visuals or a quirky style, itâs hard not to get sucked into a show this rich and explosive. Itâs daunting how this show can cram so much without feeling bloated. Itâs commendable on that aspect alone, but the payoffs to our incredible charactersâ arcs make for some of the most glorious and rewarding experiences Iâve had with anime all year. Youâve probably already made your judgment on whether or not to take this anime into consideration long before my meager self stepped into the fray, and there are several more talented writers and reviewers that have sung the praises of this anime to hell and back. However, if youâve never considered watching this anime before, then I hope this review inspires even one person to do so. Iâll stand among those who have adored this anime, so hereâs an invitation to join us.

                The story is well weaved together, never a dull moment.  It's imbued with a deep meaning as the animator shows us the glimpse of life and the beautiful side of it.  
The art is very unique and the style is not your common Anime that you'll find, it's fresh, it's quick, it's packs a punch, all because it's retro style!

I'm a sucker for sports anime so it's bias, however this anime got the action and it demonstrates it in a unique art form which makes it unique comparing to the other sports anime.  
Overall, I will give it a 10 out of 10 because it made me misty-eyed a lot of the times by portraying the deeper side of life and the relationships between doing what you love and being the best that you can be.  Very inspiring anime!",10,Rahxephon52

                     Every once in a blue moon a show comes around that completely floors me in every aspect. Ping pong is that show. It is a living and breathing entity, a moving mural and testament to the depth and beauty of the human mind. One thing is for certain: this show is about much more than just table tennis. The artwork is truly remarkable, and I don't think the show would be nearly as good without the unique tone it sets. For anyone who has a problem with it, don't worry,  there are thousands of cookie-cutter shows with animation that
                  I'm sure will satisfy you. It's shows like this that breathe new life into the medium in times when it seems there isn't anything of substance available to see. There is no fan service to be seen here other than the entirety of the show itself. It is an epic tale of love, self-acceptance and friendship amazingly condensed into just 11 short episodes without compromising anything at all.
 This, THIS is why I watch anime.",10,connoranastasio

                If I had to describe Ping Pong the Animation in one word, it would be ""sincere"". It's a show without the pretence of presenting itself in the extremes of anything in the spectrum of positive and negative. Rather, it's more like an extract of several people's lives practicing the sport ping pong. While this sounds incredibly dull, there's no way I meant that as critique to the show. If anything, it's one of the biggest plus of this particular story. It simply doesn't waver to not please biggest denominator. It's not scared to compete with other shows with a low threshold, because it's not even
                  trying to participate in the same league. It just does whatever it's supposed to do in the first place: being true to the writer's intentions and stealing the viewers' hearts while doing so. All this goodness packed in a mere sports theme that is incredibly attractive to your average viewer.
The following paragraph doesn't do the show any justice, but it's a short description to have a grasp on the story.
A young man called Makoto Tsukimoto and his best friend Yutaka Hoshino participate in their local high school ping pong club. Due to certain circumstances, their coach discovers an unlimited amount of potential in Tsukimoto, in spite of his lack of the desire to win. In order to awaken this desire, the coach focuses his attention on this ping pong prodigy. In doing so, Tsukimoto gained famed in the competitive scene. Meanwhile, his friend Hoshino witnesses how he loses his place as the former best player in the district. As a prodigy himself, it's undoubtedly a hard pill to swallow. As the story progresses, he tries to find new ways to deal with this defeat.
As for the presentation, the one thing that immediately stood out is, without a doubt, the unusual style. The amount of critique on the net is palpable, but doesn't that just show how extraordinary Ping Pong the Animation is? By deviating from the normal standards, it chooses an unconventional style that is by no means bad. No, the apt word would be ""different"".  One of the most common critique would be the deformation and the anatomical ""incorrectness"" of the characters, which is simply negligible. The problem does not so much lie within the graphical capabilities of the artist. No, it's the human inability to accept anything that is different. Truth be told, anime is -ironically- already a style heavily based on deformation.  This particular show's aesthetics is not based on how beautiful a person should look (as opposed to the anime clichÃ©), rather the interpretation of the artist of said characters.
Worth mentioning is the animation. The action scenes are astonishing. The expressive interpretation of personalities lead to some interesting stylistic choices. From the exaggeration of one's physique, to the portrayal of one's mental state, it all looks rather fresh and epic. There's always something happening on screen, even if it is just splitting the screen in multiple section to enhance the dynamic from still shots.
As mentioned before, sincerity is a big feat in Ping Pong.  This anime does not feature deus ex machina, nor doomsday scenarios, it's just life as it is: coping with the ups and downs. It doesn't feel like the script is being manufactured in order to manipulate our feelings, or to elevate the scale of the plot. It just flows like water and takes us to a destination unknown; though you might have some clue to where it's leading. Isn't that the same reason why life is so interesting?
It's remarkable how the motivation of the protagonists come before their achievements. Understandably; because who cares about any topic if there's no good motivation behind them? In this particular case, how can the viewer be interested in ping pong if there's nothing meaning behind it? This story shows us how different kinds of people look for different meanings in life. It just happen to be so that their way to comprehend life is through ping pong. A mere coincidence, if you will.
The insignificance of the physical deed being ping pong is reflected in the editing as well. Whenever there's a match going on, only the essence of said match would be shown. There's hardly any real-time footage of the game, with points being scored individually each time and all that. Instead, some relevant flashbacks would be shown in between the games and only the decisive moments of the match are being shown. Peculiarly, sometimes the match point isn't even shown. This kind of narrative leads the viewer to focus more on the internal conflicts than the physical hardships. It's a fascinating tour for a sports anime to take. A functioning one, that is.
The emotions are eerily convincing in this show. The balance of being blatantly obvious and being subtle is a very hard feat to achieve in film. Conceal too much from the viewers and you'll lose them. Show too much, you'll risk being blatantly literal, not to mention that we're back to the usual anime trope. Just like normal human beings, they show their emotions in a way that's acceptable, noticeable, yet subtle at the same time. That's because people are inconsistent, we change throughout our lives, we do hide our emotions every now and then. That's how social interaction in real life is, and that's how the writer approached the scenario. The result is the credibility of the personalities. 
A noteworthy mention is the implementation of side characters. Some of them don't do anything significant at all, which again, feels incredibly sincere. They are not just some throw-away characters, they are not inferior to the main character in any single aspect, they weren't brought to life just to do the protagonist a service, to be a stepping stone. No, in fact, they're people, just like the our main protagonists Hoshino and Tsukimoto. The only difference is the focus, which doesn't necessarily mean they're less fleshed out. In fact, they are sufficiently fleshed out, but they just don't happen to have screen-time to show their growth.
After finishing this series, I realized how much of a rut the entertainment industry is in. It's been a long time since I felt real fascination in watching a show, simply because it has became a routine for me. Ping Pong the Animation dragged me out of this routine and showed me that there are no boundaries in animation. This medium is still maturing and we shouldn't hold this process by stigmatizing unusual shows like Ping Pong. If anything, it's our responsibility to prove originality is appreciated. Believe in heroes!
!!!Don't read this last paragraph if you haven't finished the show!!!
[spoilers]
The ending got me thinking. While I rooted for Tsukimoto during the entire show, Hoshino actually won the championship. The surprising thing is, I realized I was, and should feel happy for Tsukimoto. The anime isn't so much about ping pong, but finding happiness in ping pong. Tsukimoto openly stated how he admires unremarkable players and how he admired Hoshino and his alter-ego, the Hero. He found his happiness in -not necessarily winning the finals, but in retrieving a long lost friend and a significant rival.

How does Masaaki Yuasa live up to the near perfect masterpiece that was Tatami Galaxy? By making what is undeniably to me one of the most perfect anime series ever created. I can't say it any other way. I loved Ping Pong. It is one of my favorite shows of all time. It is what I consider the single best anime of the 2010's. 
And it may very well be what I consider to be the single most perfect anime series
                  I've ever seen. 
STORY: 10/10 
Ping Pong is not really about ping pong. Rather, it focuses on the players themselves outside of the sport. Their personal lives, their passions, their backstories, their motivations. It is raw and real, while the narrative itself is very artistic, impressionistic, and experimental. The anime follows four ping pong players all intertwined by fate who ultimately confront each other in two grand national tournaments, one at the beginning and one at the end. The characters change throughout the middle, and these changes ultimately impact the second tournament and make it leap bounds above the first in both thematic and stylistic ways. 
ART: 10/10 
Ping Pong's artstyle is unique. Many will brush it off as being ""terrible"" and it's very, very easy to see why. I believe it is a masterwork of animation. The animation itself is not crap. It is extremely fluid and dynamic, and hardly ever resorts to still images. The art perfectly replicates the style that is found in the manga it's based on. This dedication makes Ping Pong one of the most perfect manga adaptations to grace the medium. 
SOUND : 10/10 
Ping Pong's soundtrack is a masterpiece of itself. Such tracks like A Hero Appears and Dragon are among my favorite songs in anime, and others like Ping Pong Phase are in my running for among the greatest songs I've ever listened to. The OST is one of the few anime soundtracks I listened from beginning to end in one sitting, and is even one I'd buy a physical copy of. It is without a doubt one of the greatest soundtracks these ears have experienced. 
The voice acting is also top notch. Each performance is raw and believable, and Kudos to Kong's VA for speaking Mandarin AND Japanese. 
CHARACTERS: 10/10 
It is utterly impossible still to me to believe that in only 11 episodes the cast of Ping Pong was so well developed. Hell, I'd even say it's the most developed cast of characters I've ever seen in a 26 episode or shorter anime series. Everyone is pitch perfect, and while they adhere to certain cliche stereotypes at first, it turns out that, like real people, there's more to them than their first impression. As the viewer spends time with these characters, a very real sense of growth is felt as they mingle with each other on the thread of destiny. I will never forget the angst and tribulations of Smile, Peco, China, Akuma, and Kazuma. I feel like I've known them my whole life, and that's the best compliment I can give for characterization. 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10 
When I can say an anime changed my perspective on life, you better know damn well that means I enjoyed it. While being touching and emotional, the anime is also hype as shit and has some truly adrenaline pumping action moments. Who knew ping pong could be so badass? On top of that, the series is laced with some mild subtle humor, but don't let that make you think this is a tongue in cheek comedy. The humor is there to make the series not a complete downer. It is a very serious and grave personal story about the lives on individuals with one of the most satisfying conclusions I've seen. 
OVERALL: 10/10 
I can't praise Ping Pong more than I have already. Perfect characterization, perfect chemistry, perfect development, perfect OST, and an art style to die for, Ping Pong the Animation transcends beyond its genre constriction as a sports anime. ping Pong is about much more than the titular sport. It is about life. It is about growing up. It is about finding, losing, and regaining your place in the world. It is about attitude, brotherhood, confidence, cooperation, dedication, discipline, respect, courtesy, honor, spirit, focus, integrity, courage, quality. The art style will throw many viewers away, but those willing to get entranced by it will not be disappointed with this ultimate coming of age epic. One of the greatest stories and experiences I've ever had in a storytelling medium.",10,Realhumanbean
22135,"
                The premise of Ping Pong: The Animation is to provide an insight into the lives of a group of young Ping Pong players who play at the highest level of competition for their age group. The showâs protagonist, Tsukimoto, who bears the nickname Smile due to his unfriendly and joyless disposition is reluctantly put through a harsh training regime by an old veteran of the sport; Butterfly Jo. Charming, well-paced and clichÃ©d in all the right ways (see classic reluctant relationship between mentor and pupil) whilst still feeling original and packed full of well-developed and relatable characters, Ping Pong offers a very rewarding journey to
                  its viewers. 
Although there are various 'battle' sequences which are beautifully stylistic and engaging in themselves, Ping Pong is nonetheless first and foremost a coming-of-age drama. Although each of the main characters we are introduced to are somewhat unhealthily obsessed with Ping Pong, the sport itself is a transferable plot device. Whether it is Ping Pong or any other sport or shared interest between the characters, the purpose of Ping Pong in the narrative is to highlight each of their own personal struggles and conflicts of interest between them. Matches give way to elaborate abstract visual poems played out to a soundtrack of each of the playersâ competing soliloquies and associated musical themes, such as Smileâs recurring 'Hero' theme song.
Alongside the naturalistic dialogue and engaging character arcs, Ping Pong also exhibits a distinctive art style and at times segmented comic book style editing much like that seen in FLCL, only less manic in its pacing. The rough-edged, back to basics art style may be somewhat jarring to anime fans who have become accustomed to certain generic conventions in animation but it is not without its charm and it feels highly appropriate for this series and the realist, grounded tone it adopts in its story-telling. The unconventional animation and varied soundtrack; which seamlessly oscillates between electronic, rock and orchestral depending on characters and setting, are always in keeping with the tone of the show at any given moment.
Each of the showâs main characters have chosen Ping Pong as their form of release and self-expression. During a game, a characterâs style of play can communicate the characterâs personality and state of mind to the audience. Playing as a chopper suits Smile down to the ground. His style of play revolves around giving up the initiative to the opponent and responding to rather than instigating attacks. This chosen style of play may be considered symbolic of Smileâs approach to life, in which he is carried along by others, finding himself pushed into a competitive approach to Ping Pong he never truly desired for himself. He plays Ping Pong for the fun of it and is initially devoid of all fighting spirit, making it hard to imagine him performing an aggressive drive or pressing himself close to the table or attempting to psyche out an opponent. Smile is completely artless and without charm, which is what makes him âwonderfulâ in the eyes of some and a refreshingly downbeat protagonist for viewers of the show.
Peco is Smileâs closest friend and also his complete opposite; as both a person and an athlete. Peco is joyful and flamboyant in his play. He is an attacking player and loves to win almost as much as he hates to lose. Peco and Smileâs matches against each other paint an accurate portrait of their friendship. Peco leads as is natural for him, and Smile follows as is his nature. However the irrepressible rise in Smileâs talent doesnât go unnoticed for long. As such, one of the major themes of Ping Pong is the changing dynamic in Peco and Smileâs relationship as both of them grow up and how they reconcile a potential challenge to the established status quo between them. 
One of the showâs most interesting supporting characters in Sakuma or âDemonâ. The match between Peco and Demon reflects the inner turmoil felt by Demon. His own anxieties regards his lack of prodigious talent come to the fore during their match. Whilst Ping Pong may be a fun pastime for Peco where victory is a natural by-product, for Demon, to defeat Peco is an opportunity to prove something to himself; that he can overcome those with greater natural advantages than himself by solely relying on effort and determination. Peco accuses of Demon of being âcheapâ and relying on âlobs and blocksâ. Demonâs response of âTable Tennis is evolvingâ is reflective of his meticulous nature and obsessive personality which are in turn reflected in his chosen style of play. Demon has worked tirelessly to evolve to a point where he can challenge Peco; someone whom he admires and also envies. 
Kazama and Kong, another two of the showâs supporting characters, are both shown to be motivated by family. Kazamaâs obsession with victory, the restoration of his fatherâs honour and the prosperity of his familyâs business all link themselves inextricably with his indomitable style of play. His shaven head, relentless practice regime and refusal to even visit his own mother are all products of his iron-cast will to prove himself and validate his immediate familyâs position in the Kazama clan. Kong has family motivations also. He wants to pay his mother back for her support and rectify previous failures in his homeland which led to his subsequent âexileâ in Japan. Each of the major characters of Ping Pong encounter each other at various points as their character arcs intertwine. The changing relationships between characters magnify their personal development and the strikingly natural and realistic dialogue between the showâs major players make each of these scenes a pleasure to watch.
Smile announces to us early on in the story that âI just quietly do as Iâm told, like a robotâ. This robot conceit is carried throughout the series in the form of abstract sequences in which Smile, known for both his robotic personality and style of play, calls out for a âheroâ. As the story of Ping Pong gradually unfolds we witness Smile learn the lesson that âhot blood flows through (his) bodyâ, the same as everyone else. Smileâs love of Ping Pong allows him his opportunity for both escapism and self-expression and as the story progresses the lessons he learns from his rise in the sport help form him into the Smile we see at the end of the story.",10,Caterlyn

                I generally look for ""BAD"" Anime to watch based on my first impressions. Why do I look for them? because I want to watch ""time wasters"" and those stuff literally waste my time. OK that's not the actual reason but honestly I don't understand it myself I know I'm going into a ""BAD"" anime and I won't enjoy it but I can't stop myself from watching the first Episode every time I see them and I think I have a mental disorder that won't let me calm down until I finish it honestly my 'Dropped' list is more like 'On Hold' list.
Now that that's done
                  I don't actually read reviews to determine what ""BAD"" anime to watch I go by instinct and it's pretty easy to find ""BAD"" Anime anyway. So I saw Ping Pong and It's art style plus it's Ping Pong how good can something like that be I imagined Prince of Tennis stuff that break rackets and whatnot plus the unusual style. I was like HOW GOOD CAN IT BE and then I clicked First Episode.
Then I was hit by Ping Pong the Animation.
||____||
TALENT and EFFORT
The way it was portrayed in this series was GREAT. 
It had one theme and it focused on this.
The characters felt real and alive.
Animation was fluid which was unexpected.
Never thought Ping Pong could be used like THIS.
The Characters don't just have back stories for the sake of it.
They are connected and it really feels like their decision led them to where there are now. This is quite the achievement considering it's only 11 episodes most Anime suffer from lack of development because they're too short. But Ping Pong got the number right.
The animations are good and lively and the expressions are pretty well done.
The Sound fits perfectly and the Songs match the Anime quite well.
The ART STYLE is something people will avoid this for or get people to watch it. But I don't think I understand Art that much since I don't appreciate paintings that are supposed to be ""LEGENDARY"" or ""NEW"".
EXPECTATIONS BLOWN AWAY!

                I watched Ping Pong the Animation as it aired, since the first episode. I almost dropped it after seeing the first episode, because of the art style. It's extremely unconventional, to a ridiculous degree. Technically I actually did drop it. However, the next week when I thought about it I decided to give it another shot, and that was when I realized that I really enjoyed it.
The character relationships are very modest and feel real. No single personality is similar in any way, not even amongst background characters. They also saw to it that each and every character was developed throughout the series.
In terms of
                  the sports side of it, I suppose it's up to interpretation. If you don't find the art style growing on you, you may not enjoy the scenes where they play matches. However, if the art style does grow on you, you'll get seriously pumped up for it. The art style may be madly unconventional and the characters may seem to be the main draw, but this is a sports anime at heart and maaaaan do they play sports. Every single match is more awesome than the last.
The soundtrack is pretty great, as well. I find myself listening to the OP in my free time. Every song they use matches the mood of the show and the attitude of the scene perfectly.",10,basedforever42

                Ping Pong The Animation is, in my opinion, the best anime ever created. It's a show whose main point is the drama and interactions between characters, where Ping Pong is often used as a medium to depict those interactions, instead of being the main focus of the show. That's why I think that it's disingenuous to call Ping Pong The Animation a sports anime.
The first thing you might notice when watching Ping Pong is probably it's art-style and animation. It's extremely unrealistic and unorthodox. A lot of people might see it and think that's it's an ugly show, but I would highly advise giving it
                  a chance. You get used to the odd art-style very quickly, and when you do, you start to appreciate the often stellar animation and amazing direction.
The whole series is carried by it's incredible characters. Every character gets developed, and even those with little screen-time become incredibly interesting by the end of the series. There is no obvious ""hero"" or ""villain"", as every character has a backstory and motivation for their actions, making them all unique and intriguing. After every match you can't help feeling bad for the losers, while at the same time being glad for the guy who won, which shows you that this series' writing really sets it apart from most anime these days.
The Opening is really energetic and gets you pumped for the episode, while the Ending is kind of relaxing and more emotional, and adds to the feeling of closure which the episode gives.
Overall, I can safely say that I've never seen a better anime, and I honestly doubt that I will any time soon. I've seen Ping Pong multiple times, each time enjoying it more than the last, which has promptly placed it as one of my favourite pieces of media ever. Everyone should watch this show, regardless of their preferred genres.",10,DeMilan

                I am baffled at the fact that I, the anti-sportsperson, the epitome of sloth, someone that has always prided themselves on their ultimate rejection of and indifference towards sport in general, have given the most perfect score I have ever given to any anime to a sports anime, let alone a sports anime about... Ping Pong? I have tried to talk myself out of it to fulfill this tiresome element of my personality to no avail. I cannot find fault with Ping Pong the Animation. I am not exaggerating. I am not being sarcastic. I am genuinely taken aback.
Ping Pong the Animation features some of
                  the most dynamic characters I have ever seen in an anime, a unique art style that, betraying my expectations, was fluid, evocative and flawless, a soundtrack that created an atmosphere that made my chest swell. It followed a realistic, fulfilling and totally satisfying course. There was not a single point in watching this anime at which I felt bored or disinterested in what was going on. I would never have expected that I could watch two characters play sport with such attentiveness. 
I feel like this anime is on another level. The other series I have rated 10/10, I had words for what they made me feel and how they affected me. Somehow, the right words elude me here. I am so impressed. 
To someone who doesn't play sport and therefor cannot relate this show as literally to myself as someone who does play sport might, I still found that Ping Pong contained messages about life, passion and loneliness that apply to us all. The characters each express the different ways in which people find purpose and meaning in their lives and validate their identities, yet without the characters being forced, abstract and/or tropes. They are so human it's almost tangible. 
Trying to describe what this series evokes in me is useless. All I can say is that it is joyful, deeply beautiful and profound.",10,hinekure

                ""The Hero Appears. The Hero Appears. The Hero Appears.""
From the director who brought us, among others, The Tatami Galaxy and Kaiba, comes Ping Pong the Animation.
By definition, this would be a sports anime, and it is indeed centered around the lives of several ping pong players in different high schools striving to be better, but this is a pretext for much more than just youths battling each other over titles, fame, rewards or anything truly tangible- this is much more a story about coming of age than it is one of competition.
The competitive sub-plot isn't the focal point of this series and is, in fact,
                  something quite ordinary and unlike other anime related to competition: there's no actual grand prize sought by many, there's no overpowered and unreachable rival who is yet to be defeated, and the main character is not an unseen talent which manages to overcome odds and out-skill its competitors without any effort. 
The game itself isn't analysed too much either: it's just there as a subtext for developing the story while still not being neglected at all, or certain mechanics and set pieces left unexplained, so the viewer is never confused and does not forget what the pretext for the story is.
In other words, you can jump right into it even if you're not a fan of this discipline to begin with.
Its setup may be confusing at first, since it does seem to introduce characters that later on, from one's perspective, may become clichÃ©d antagonists for our heroes to conquer, but this is not the case. In fact, each and every one of the characters of Ping Pong is likeable, human, and realistic. There are no 'evil' or 'good' sides, and is indeed just a collection of well developed characters measuring each other through game to see who is better at the sport they are in love with.
Indeed, this is a sports anime closer to its definition than many of its colleagues: it's a story about camaraderie, dealing with loss and celebrating victory, improving oneself and understanding others, making friends to accompany each other on the trip through adolescence, partaking in a shared hobby, having fun and creating memories. In fact, this is what the actual essence of sports is, or at least should be.
Each and every character competing against one another is well defined, equally as important, and never briefly introduced only to be forgotten just until minutes before a decisive match. Even though Peco and Smile have the majority of screen time and focus, in the end, none of the other people presented are any less important than the two of them, and you might attach yourself more to a character that wasn't meant to be the focus of the main story in the first place. The voice acting also helps a lot to deliver this result as well.
As you can imagine, characters are the strong point of this series, and it does shine quite brightly: they're all well defined, with their own weaknesses and strong points, and are more human than what your average animation cast is. They don't need colorful somatic traits to be memorable: they're skilled albeit ordinary ping pong players, every one of them strong in some way, every one with its own defects, contradictions, and hardships them alone must face and overcome.
Its uniquely gorgeous art style, along with its upbeat and fitting soundtrack, skilfully paced story and execution manage to deliver in eleven episodes what many praised series struggle to do in 26. I personally recall feeling this series to be longer than that just because of how good its storytelling was.
Would I recommend this series? Absolutely. It's one of the best series of 2014, and it will probably remain in your memory for a long time, along with its characters and its fulfilling sense of growth.",9,Arqhea

                This review may contain some very mild possible spoilers so beware.
When two geniuses meet you can have either pretty messy thing or a masterpiece. Thankfully for us Ping Pong The Animation is the later. 
Story: The original story of Taiyo Matsumoto's Ping Pong is one of the best sports manga ever created. It uses ping pong as a medium for characters to interact and express themselfs. The complexity of plot threads and use of symbolism is outstanding. 
Art: Here is where people seem to have a problem. Taiyo Matsumoto's artstyle is definitively different from the mainstream manga artists. It's not ""bad"" it's just different. The
                  animation itself is good. It's fluid and use of panels like in the manga is effective. The art is usually highly subjective topic so take it as you will but from a production point of view the animation is good.
Sound: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. The sound effects are sharp, the voice acting is perfect. The music is ...well it's breathtaking. Personaly for me Ping Pong The Animation has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. I'll be looking forward to more of Kensuke Ushio's work because what he did with his music is just straight up amazing. What's also great is the fact that he uses ping pongs as instruments in some of the songs. And it works! 
Character: This is probably best part of Ping Pong The Animation. The development of characters is amazing. Some of the best development I've seen. It almost rivals development of characters from the manga REAL which  has in my mind the best development in the manga. I don't want to spoil anything but the fact that each of the 5 ""main"" characters come full circle from the point of despair to the point of hope is amazing. Coming in terms with understanding who they are, and individualy helping each other to access this understanding. It's beautiful. This is an anime that has no losers. Everybody wins. 
Enjoyment: For me personaly it was a blast. The ping pong matches themself are fun and energetic, the characters are enjoyable, the music is great, and the anime has no real filler moments.
Overall: This is my most favourite anime of all time, and is one of the few anime that made me cry. So this review may be biased. However Ping Pong The Animation deserves all praise and all attention it got and should be praised much more. What Taiyo Matsumoto created and Masaaki Yuasa with his staff put on the screen is something that everybody should watch in their life. As it is very inspirational,beautiful and overall nothing short of a masterpiece.

                ""No man so good, but another may be as good as he.""
There are many good lines out there in this anime that it's hard to put them all out there, but this one stuck to me the most. In life there will always be someone who will better than you. It's how you handle that reality, and better yourself in the process that will make you shine in what you are pursuing.
This anime is a sports anime. Yes. But this sports anime will teach you NOT just merely about friendship, but of life as well. And when teaching about life, one has to know the
                  harsh reality it brings. Many sports anime nowadays seem to concern on beating the enemy with a super power up that has been formulated with effort and considerable dreaming. Not that it makes it any less fun, but sometimes, the truth and meaning of reality is taken away. Ping Pong the Animation does not sugarcoat that aspect. It stays true to the sport. It stays true to the messages it bring.
We have two friends, Tsukimoto and Hoshino a.k.a. Smile and Peco respectively, play table tennis at their current high school table tennis club. Peco here is our protagonist who is what you may categorize as a light-- always shining and always loves what he loves best-- table tennis. Smile on the other hand is our shadow-- he never outshines our light. You get the idea. Until one event overturns this balance, and it will start the gears of Ping Pong in full throttle. 
It's not only the dynamics of this duo and how they trust in their friendship through table tennis that drive this anime, but how every character in this anime have love for the sport and this pushes them to continue fighting and believing in what they can contribute and achieve to the field. Kazama, the old lady of Tamura, Poseidon's president, etc-- they all have different back stories which PPtA helps show and make us understand what they're going through; that not all people are meant for greatness on that field, but still can find what they want if they try hard enough; that fully realizing your dreams is all about effort and tenacity to stand up even when you fall so hard; guiding the young in their adversities and troubles; and that having fun while pursuing your dream is never a sin, but a privilege only a few will understand.
The reason the animation is what it is is because they are following the manga's style, not because it sucks or that animators are lazy to begin with. It is what it is. Most new to anime will prolly be turned off by this anime's style, but I assure you that if you go past that you will surely see a gem that's totally worth your time. The OSTs are really catchy and their lyrics really hit the mark to this anime's themes, and I really am hooked listening to them; the sound effects are crisp and right on the mark, giving off very realistic sounds to the anime which you will undoubtedly enjoy.
Honestly, this anime will make you root for ALL of the characters. Whether you suck at sports or not, you will surely want to FEEL what they have. That's the effect of this masterpiece. And surely, nothing will happen if you don't take the first step-- that is, by watching its first episode.

                Regarding Anime genres, after a certain point it is difficult to constantly find new titles to pique one's interest.  I was avoiding Ping Pong the Animation for the longest time, because I really did not want to suffer through another Masaaki Yuasa overrated mess. But given the lack of any interesting sports anime (on my radar at least), the high rating, and the NoitaminA length, I decided to give it a go. On hindsight, maybe I should've tried to get into the Mahou Shoujo genre.
I already can hear the opposition arguing that this is not a sports anime. Well, we have high-school sports clubs,
                  rivals, mentors, training montages, and tournaments. So, yeah, it is a sports anime. Maybe it transcends the genre you say? Failing the aspects that make the genre great does not imply transcendence. Not sure what the right word is, but it is not transcendence. 
Let us examine why. Firstly, there are no stakes in Ping Pong the Animation. There is zero interest for the outcome of the matches. And as a side-note, the outcome of each one is painfully predictable. The sports genre has been successful, for at least 35 years, in creating stakes using as simple a device as âZettai Koshienâ. Simply disregarding that characteristic takes away much of the flavor. Even the various skill levels and the closing of the skill gap is presented without consistency and logic, making the matches even less interesting (and I repeat, they are already predictable).  A final note on the subject of the matches, I dare you to try to handle the cheese of the semi-finals.
You would think that since the sports facet is not emphasized, the characters would be well written and a coming of age story would emerge. It does not. The characters are a collection of over-the-top scenes that highlight their traits, and then, we receive neither substance nor development. Ok, I guess Wenge Kong, even though he started as a caricature, had an interesting story, but he is only a minor character. 
That lack of substance is the major problem; no matter how many times you repeat âThe hero comesâ and âBlood tastes like ironâ, no matter how artsy you make the image while you repeat it, if you fail to attach any meaning to it, it's just pretentious and hollow. I would rather hear âKatsu! Katsu! Zettai katsu!â for the millionth time from a character I care about, than this pointless drivel.
To be fair, there are some interesting psychological ideas present in the beginning, but they are not worth mentioning because they are immediately dropped in favor of the pointlessness and the pretentiousness. Even Battery, a later NoitaminA addition which the consensus (rightfully I think) judged as a failure, tried harder to get away from the typical genre tropes and touched more mature psychological subjects with better care.
I should say something about the weird art style.I do not even mind it. I think in general it is good to experiment with different art styles, especially when the CGI dominance is upon us, but the style was not something special. It had some artistic moments, but nothing that could come even close to saving the train-wreck.
I wrote too many words where one would suffice to describe Ping Pong the Animation. That word is insipid. My suggestion is also brief: Do not watch it. I know that taste is relative and âTo each his ownâ is a very important axiom to me, but I think the Anime/Manga community should not fall so easily for blatant pretentiousness and/or hype. 3.5/10.",4,Darmaiad

                Ping pong - or, rather, table tennis - will forever remind me of the dissatisfying lunch-times I expended in fruitlessly playing it with my school fellows on a rainy day. To me it was the equivalent of table football; a miniaturized version of an actual sport intended less for the pursuit of physical glory and excellence than the sake of sheer enjoyment, accessible even to those who lacked the prowess and stamina required to partake in the full-sized namesakes. In short, a mere game, no more noble or dignified than Monopoly or MMORPGs.
It wasnât until my first excursion to East Asia than I became aware
                  of the magnitude it possessed in the lives of some people. Teaching English at a university in China, the topic of âsportsâ predictably reared its head for one day of the two-week crash course I was flailing my way through. And invariably, âtable tennisâ was mentioned - and not once, fleetingly tacked onto a list of nouns. Indeed, in games of pictionary I hosted to pass the time as innocuously as possible, the word âtable tennisâ would be shrieked before even the slightest smudge of chalk had attempted to delineate the designated word. The frequency with which a student mistakenly presumed table tennis to be the selected piece of vocabulary reached such absurd proportions that it turned into somewhat of a running-joke, where even on days when the curriculum stipulated topics unrelated to sport, table tennis was self-satirically invoked.
âWhyâ, I asked the class one day, âis there such an unusual interest in table tennis?â
âBecause,â one plucky student in the front-row answered, âit is our national sport.â
âAnd so,â I followed-up, âare you the best in the world at it?â
âYes,â he sniggeringly replied, âmuch better than the Japanese.â
Imagine my delight, then, when I discovered an anime about table tennis that included a Chinese character and, furthermore, was directed by Masaaki Yuasa, the mastermind behind the animated adaption of The Tatami Galaxy. 
The shared aesthetic of the two shows is the first registered thought upon one's initial viewing - before character or story or soundtrack can make themselves known, one is smacked by the ambivalence of watching an anime that doesn't look at all like an anime. This has been known to deter some - including a rather poetically-adverse housemate of mine - before the first episode is even over, but it enchanted me, and entranced me into a universe that only the works of Yuasa could inhabit. The artwork is scruffy, cartoonish, and two-dimensional. A cursory evaluation would make one think that it was drawn in haste, without finesse. And yet 
it also struck me as sinister, bleak, and withering: the markings of a comfortless world.
And this is perfect - because this is the crux of the show. There is no comfort to be found anywhere. A grand purpose is usually where we think we will find a simulacrum of meaning in this world of ours - to be a writer, a musician, a baker, a politician, a husband, a wife, a parent, a capitalist, a saviour - and a lot of anime side-steps answering any big existential questions by ascribing their characters these sorts of teleologies that more often than not define the experience of what you're watching. But in Ping Pong The Animation the chosen purpose of the characters, table tennis, proves to be too elusive for most of them to grab ahold of (they're either too bad, too old, too injured, or don't care enough), and even the ones who (however temporarily) succeed in the sport (for, yes, that is what table tennis qualifies as outside of this parochial island I am stranded on) never quite manage to find a true sense of completion or fulfillment.
The first two character we are introduced to are Makoto ""Smile"" Tsukimoto, and his childhood friend, Yukata ""Peco"" Hoshino. They have interlinking backstories that are revealed in mystifying patches that have us trying to scramble together some sort of picture of their respective motives for playing the sport. We're then treated to a fairly appreciable range of other characters, all of whom have their backstories sufficiently fleshed-out despite the eleven-episode limit placed on the series. This means that no times is wasted, which on the one hand is good, but on the other isn't as the lack of space produces a rather scrambled effect (perhaps, I venture now, the purpose) and by leaving no time to reflect or breath unintentionally nullifies the rather profound message that lies at the heart of the narrative.
The anime contained many devices parallel to your run-of-the-mill pre-teen shounen, for behind the surrealistic imagery stands a story about a selection of young men all competing to become the best (besides, at first, ""Smile"", who is largely apathetic about winning and losing, and will forfeit matches in order to save the pride of his opponent), and who have to finish in the final four of their regional tournament in order to progress onto the next level of play. Our heroes battle it out for a shot at the title - cue training montages, and esoteric talk of special moves or abilities that are being honed - but first they must come face-to-face with the indomitable, menacing, seemingly invincible cadre that comprises the main rival school, and they have a grand master helping them out, and etc., etc., etc,. It would not be too inconceivable for one to believe that Ping Pong The Animation was written by the team who produced Beyblade after they'd spent six months holed up in a shed sniffing glue.
Living in the post-postmodern era, one can never be too sure that irony isn't afoot, and I half-suspect Ping Pong of parodying the hackneyed tropes of table-top shounen. But what is of real virtue about this anime is that it makes so many serious, thought-provoking points about the concept of sport itself and, by extension, of life itself. It questions more than any other media I've ever experienced: what is the point of playing sport? It was as if by the end of the final episode it envisioned the sort of world where Goku and all the other Z-fighters had been spontaneously sapped of their fighting abilities, and it was declared that there would never be a threat to Earth ever again, and they were now all struggling to find new identities whilst looking rather foolish in the process of doing so. 
Parody or not, however, I can't stomach the tropes that usually accompany shounen, and for that I found myself faintly bored during some of the matches - the outcomes of which were all too predictable (though perhaps that was, again, the point). There's a heartening dollop of comedy that finds its greatest expression through the Japan-China rivalry that, as I have experienced first-hand, is all too fierce. But I'm afraid, in spite of the grandeur of the animation and the pleasingly didactic nature of the show, I'm going to award it a 7, for it at times failed at the ultimate goal: entertainment.",7,The_Languid_One

                Excuse me my grammar may be horrid.
I originally just play games everyday, yet i noticed on youtube that Funimation posted a promo for this anime. This was unnatural to me because Funimation usually post more moe/ecchi anime. After watching the promo I decided to check out the anime and slowly got hooked into to the greatness that is this anime.
The story follows two main characters, Peco and Smile, and follows them on their journey of playing table tennis. Other major support characters are met(Akuma, Kong, and Kazama) during this journey, there are other minor support characters but these five characters are the main focus around
                  the series. Each character has their own motives for playing ping pong, some being for the pure enjoyment of the sport, others for seeking fame and so forth. Some of these characters can start out as people you would hate or despise yet as the series progresses you understand the background of these characters and why they truly play the sport. Also as the story moves on the characters mature being more respectable to each other and likeable to the audience. Overall the development for these characters, and even minor characters, is amazing and is an element that makes this series enjoyable. The story is also good yet if it wasn't for this group of characters and possible replace with a more generic bunch then it would be less enjoyable.
The art for this anime is amazing. The unique art style caught my eye and made me want to watch this anime. The art style pays respect to it's source material and does it well, the animation can at some times be funky yet when the anime needs to be good, it looks great.
The music for this series is probably one of the most enjoyable soundtracks i have heard since watching other animes such as Deathnote or Cowboy Bebop. The music captures each scene greatly and at no point I have complained about it.
Overall this anime is probally one of the best animes of the spring season and an extremely enjoyable anime I have watched in a long time. I would be happy to re-watch this anime, it still feels incredible to watch after the 5th viewing.",9,Kiddew

This is the most awkward anime I have ever had the most vacillating feelings for. PP the Animation is a very pleasant experience for the 11 episode you get out of it, and the character development is quite...unique as well, but when it comes down to asking ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"", there is hardly an answer that can be settled upon.
First off, the soundtrack is amazing. That is indisputably the best part of this anime, which wouldn't have gotten the ratings it did on MAL without it. But, I've been watching anime for
                  a long time people, and I can tell when something is good with or without the soundtrack, and this averages low 7s range without its music.
And the art! How am I supposed to judge that?! At times it was really gorgeous, and at others, really ugly, and every now and then it was ugly in a pretty way. So range for that is anywhere between 6-8. I can definitely say the last frame where Hoshino is blowing bubble gum in the opening is the most disturbing video motion on a screen I've seen in anime to date. One that makes me want to wreck my television screen with his face on it. 
Like I said earlier, the most unique aspect is the character development. It's not bad, but I can't say it's necessarily great either. It's completely exotic from what we typically see. It's not too deep, and the atmosphere does literally just enough that we understand our characters without having to know a whole lot about them. We get the ""I feel you, bro"" vibe from the anime, and it truly unlocks our sixth sense of reading atmosphere like no other show has been able to get us to do before. In doing so, it's one of the most unconventional works in anime on the planet to date. 
However, I think it's just sooo across the spectrum that I can't give it anything more than anywhere between 7-8/10 but I don't think it's an 8.7 like the average dictates. I just don't think it's that phenomenal that it deserves to be called a masterpiece or excellent. I think it's really good, and that's all there is too it. I definitely appreciate it though. It's a game changer.",7,quitobarajas

                This will be my first and possibly only review, as I feel this anime truly deserves it, if I'm going to review one anime, I want it to be this one. This anime is a masterpiece. I'll start out the story. I can't really explain the story as it would give away the fun of watching it unfold, but I will say this, it's a coming of age story about two friends. The art is sadly what will turn many people away from it, as it already has unfortunately. The art did not bother me a single second, I found it worked well and showed
                  everything perfect and it's actually very close to the manga itself (which I have no read, I have just seen pictures). It's a shame the art has turned so many people off without a second glance, but I think everyone should give this a watch. I'm not telling a lie when I say it truly is a masterpiece. Passing over from the art, I think the sound is outstanding. The entire soundtrack, including the opening and ending are amazing, and everything sounds great. The characters are all outstanding and great as well, as not a single one is really unlikable. They are all interesting, and very realistic. I enjoyed this anime a ton, and finished it in two days. I watched the first two episodes the first day, and the rest the second day. Overall I would give this anime a ten out of ten. And I think anyone who has eyes and is able to see should watch this. Maybe even blind people should give it a chance. It's a masterpiece, and I know I have already said that, but I'll say it again. There is truly no anime like this one. Another thing I would like to add to end this off is I was crying during the final episode. Almost nothing makes me cry, so I was extremely surprised, yet happy. At the end of the final episode I was content.",10,AidanTheGreat

                Just can say WOW for this title.
Nowaday we can't see anime like this.not because graphic ( watch this make me back to 90-00 ),
but the storyline.
From Peco i can learn that human feel pain when lose something,but if you can made the pain change to be passion,you can achieve what you want.
From Smile,i can learn we need to be stronger by self.From zero to be something.from no one to be something.
many character have different problem for what i see,but they have way to deal with it.what special ? it was human today problem,made me thinking everytime i watch this.made me can take some life advice
                  from here.
After all,i really really recomended you to watch this.
PS : Really love OP and EP because unique !",10,Obinhartono

                At first, I will say that I am truly sorry if I'm going to offend anyone with this score. I've met a few people that almost disowned all my anime opinions the moment I said I don't like this one, bonus points if I could say I've dropped it mid-way.
The only thing I don't have any problems with is the story, I would totally watch if done by different people. Otherwise, I found it extremely hard to watch, I strongly dislike the art and animation style (and don't give me the usual stick that different doesn't equal bad, I know that, bad equals bad, it
                  doesn't bother me that it's different) and I also find most characters very unlikeable. The animation bothered me so much that it gave me headaches two episodes in, or in my experience, 3-4 hours in the second episode. Oh, yeah, I also found it boring. Overall it doesn't sound like a pleasant experience, does it?
But I can still see why people would like it and I respect studio to go with this unorthodox art style. At the same time, I can clearly see why some people would hate this one and as you can see, I'm not going with the usual stick, I guess I'm somewhere in the middle, I will fully admit that I don't like this anime and I don't care how innovative and creative it is. And to many fans, stop being so pretentious, a majority of watchers rated this anime high, you are not a special snowflake if you enjoy it too and it doesn't make your exquisite taste above everyone else's.",3,kuroishi_x

At the beginning when I started this series I thought it's awful but when I saw it take the prize of best anime series in 2014 I insisted to finish it and yeah... it was very interesting and the change of characters was amazing
Story (With No Spoilers): For the first view we will see it as traditional sport story but if we take a close look we will see that it's very well written and also the happy end of each character impress me
Art: It is the main problem of this anime, and I'm sure that if the art was good
                  it will be masterpiece but the studio prove that the art isn't everything at all
Sound: The sound is gorgeous and it will take U into another world when U hear the sound of hitting the ball in the table
Character: The Most Thing I love it in the anime is the development of characters and every character change its goal and change its way of thinking and no one fall in this anime without rise up again even the one-Episode character and everyone in the end know the place of Ping Pong in his heart
I recommend it for every Ping Pong player no matter he is Pro or amateur and for every Sport Anime Lover watch it, U will like it... The Art is disgusting in the first but with time U will get used to it and the story will take your attention away from the art",7,beshoyholmes

                Often times I give out scores of 10 to shows i just really enjoy, they have some flaws, but i overlook them because of the sheer joy they bring me.
This is not one of those flippant scores.  
Why should you watch this?  Ping Pong is short series that has so much depth you can drown in it, and yet is so engaging that you can wallow in the shallow enjoyment.  What you take out of this is up to you.
The animation at first glance looks pretty terrible.  And then somewhere along in the first episode you realize that it's absolutely brilliant.
                   The flow of the lines, the emotions that are drawn and emphasized with those squiggly black lines convey more meaning than words often can.  Looking at this was simply enjoyable, outside of the content.  The art is a paradox; on one hand its chaos, the other its ordered better than clean lines because of the superior perspective it gives.
I could go on...for a long time about the grandiosity of the art.
The story is really the bread and butter, so i'm not going to belabor this review with an in depth synopsis.  I will say that for every person that sees this, i believe there will be a different idea born about what exactly this show is about.  Sure it's a show about ping pong.  It's also a ""coming-of-age"" show about boys on the fringe of society.  It is about the connection of friendship, hardship and leadership and a willingness to achieve things through hard work and the points at which talent supersedes all desire.  More importantly, this is a about what you take from it.  I do believe it will affect you emotionally and even spiritually.  There are many parallels I drew from this personally, so I identified with it more so than many of my favorite shows.
I hope I got you mildly interested and made a case for my rating; its not an objective view of the content of this media, but a personal expression of my appreciation and enjoyment of it.",10,Marthgun

                Ping Pong The Animation tries its best, Iâll say that much, someone put a lot of effort and deliberation into making this good, and not just another formulaic sports anime with no motive other than money, and so thanks for trying, but the fact of the matter is, despite its best efforts, itâs not especially enjoyable. 
For starters, the animation, which Iâm going to go on record saying is quite genuinely awful, though Iâm sure plenty would disagree with me on the matter, and will instead tell me that itâs instead experimental or unconventional, but to me itâs just plain bad. The characters are genuinely
                  ugly, they move like cheaply made puppets, and a lot of times you can really see where they were cutting corners. Take one instance, in which someone was crying, but you would have no idea based upon their face, and their whole body remained complete static, and even within that static image of them, there was no hint of sadness within their face, if not the tears you would not begin to guess this character was feeling anything at all. Or another, in which a full 30 second shot consisted entirely of the same second of animation, while Iâm sure many will agree to disagree, and all things considered youâll just have to look at it yourself and make up your own mind, but to me at least, the animation was downright repulsive, which hampered my experience, to put it mildly.
As for the actual story, as one may infer from the title, it is about a group of blokes playing ping pong for their school team, which is apparently a really big deal, in my high school experience, the only team that anyone gave the slightest fucketh about was the football team, but it seems in Japan being on the ping pong team in your high school is hardly a step down from playing in the Olympics, they fly to international tournaments, theyâve got all sorts of coaches and these people really give it their all, the Chinese fella in particular, he acted like if he lost heâd get sent to the gulag, but, point aside, they play ping pong, and itâs a main part of the show, there is no shortage of pinging of the pongs, and I suppose they do a reasonably good job of keeping it interesting, and showing that thereâs a lot more strategy in a game as basic as ping pong is than youâd perhaps expect, but this focus is not exclusive, and the personal lives and emotions of the characters are shown as well. And, somehow, they managed to give the characters actual nuance, rather than making them completely melodramatic, because people still like soap operas, for some alien reason. So, the characters are reasonably interesting, but truth be told, Iâd rather they just went with one route or the other, character or sport, weâre shown these somewhat interesting characters, though it would be nice if at least one of them wasnât a complete asshole, but, weâve got them, yet not a huge amount is done with them on account of the fact that they have to spend a large proportion of their time playing ping pong, which isnât bad necessarily, the ping pong matches werenât boring, but I was more interested in the characters than the game, the game holds metaphorical importance and such, fair enough, but I wouldâve given priority to the characters, because they are the more interesting lot, despite the depth of ping pong, there is rather little to continue to keep it fresh when the game is so static, there are less variables than a game like football or mahjong, but itâs still fine, and really, if thereâs one word to describe Ping Pong, itâs fine. Taking the animation out of the equation, it doesnât have anything egregiously bad, but itâs not got anything that good either, it has no major strengths, but no major weaknesses either, them playing ping pong is fine, the characters themselves are fine, but neither of them have anything to majorly interest the viewer, this isnât to say itâs a bad watch, just a very average one â it is exceptionally unexceptional.",5,SCLFI

                ""Hero has no weakness"" -- Smile
""Ping Pong is freaking blast"" -- Pico
This is the one of the (very)few sports anime that shows the reality of how life works.
Lets review each of the main topics constituting this anime.
story: 9/10
This Story is when Talent X Hardwork X Expectations  cross paths with each other .
Story mainly follows Tsukimoto Makoto (""Smile"")  and his friend hyperactive Hosino Yukata ( ""Pico"") through the two years of their highschool life  at their table tennis club.Story is quite fast paced as you expect from a 11 episode anime but very few anime achieve what this anime achieved.And that is development
                  of all the characters it introduces in smooth manner without forcing them in that direction.
This is one show where there are no antagonists or protagonists.Everybody is doing their own thing and there are no super powers to main characters (as there are in certain sports shows) and no special moves to any characters  and as stated early this show shows contrast between talent, hardwork and expectations
--Spoilers--
Smile is Talented and Hard working but does not feel anything for the game whether he wins or losses . Where as Pico is Talented and Enjoyes the game some where losses his path due to various reasons and get defeated by China, and Akuma. But he rediscovers his love for the game, train's hard and finally wins the tournament. This shows that talent is not sufficient to succeed but you also needed hard work and love for the job you do to succeed in life. And it also Shows that how hard you may work, if somebody is talented than you and work hard less than you they will succeed and surpass you. 
--SpoilersEnd--
This is true in real life. If you are talented and works hard at a thing and you enjoyes doing it then you are sure to succeed and if you lack any one of these then there will be less chance of success. 
Art: 10/10
I am the first one to admit that the art style threw me off the first time i watched this anime. I even dropped this anime because of that. But after picking it again and just after 1st episode art style grew on me and i cannot imaging this anime with any other art style. I am even glad to see once a sports anime without all handsome/beautiful looking characters. Character designs are quite original and crude just as the anime intend them to be. Characters may be crude but backgrounds are quite beautiful
And i am giving it a 10 because i judged it wrong the first time.
Sound: 8/10
OP is quite good and it goes well with the theme of the anime and some of the sound tracks are really beautiful to hear and the song by 'china' is easily the top's the list of best Christmas song :p . Ending song is ok. Background music fits perfectly for this anime.
Characters: 9/10
This show mainly focuses on the five characters who represents different types of people present around you.
Tsukimoto Makoto: Nicknamed ""Smile"" by his peers is quite talented and good at Ping Pong but cannot go all out against his best friend pico. He shows very little emotion and does not have any feelings whether it is winning or losing. He just plays for the sake of playing.
Hosino Yukata: Nicknamed ""Pico"" have quite opposite personality of his friend Smile and he is always active, Talented in Ping Pong. He shows emotion quite often crying when he lose and happy when he won. He loves Ping Pong and enjoy's playing the sport.
Manabu Sakuma: Nicknamed ""Demon""(Akuma) is childhood friend of Smile and Pico but not as Talented in Ping Pong. Though he compensates his lack of talent with hardwork and he tries to defeat Pico and by that showing hardwork can trump over Talent.
Ryuuichi Kazama: Nicknamed ""Dragon"" is one year senior of Akuma and his teams captain. He believes that winning is the sole purpose of life and strives to take his club to its former glory.
Wenge Kong: Nicknamed ""China"" is Chinese player who arrives to Japan to defeat all the top Japanese to show the Chinese that they are wrong and there by regaining his place in China national team. 
And there are many other side characters who are unique, original and real.
Enjoyment:9/10
I quite enjoyed this show and will recommend to anyone even those who do not watch sports anime but some may get off because of art style. And it has great rewatch value.
Overall: 9/10
This is the one of the most underrated and best anime 2014 and you may think me of as some fanboy since i did not write anything bad about this anime. But Seriously i tried to find bad things about this anime but just cannot find them.

22135,"
                I have to say, when my brother told me to watch this, I always knew it was going to be good. No, I'm not going to say it was the most mind-blowing thing I have ever seen, but I felt sincerely touched watching this show and I had truly enjoyed it. Even the art style had it's own uniqueness that you get accustomed to and end up loving in an odd way. The story all had promising and good characters that you all end up loving one way or another. Everything's realistic enough, which is honestly why I think they switched up the art style.
                  If this had the same classic ""bright"" anime style like most romcoms for example, I don't think I would be able to take this show as seriously as I did. I felt as though this show had put a lot of effort into its characters and their stories. 
This is 2nd to last paragraph I'm going to add to this review because I honestly cannot say anything better than what any other reviewer says about this review. I don't feel like tarnishing its name and would rather have good reviewers speak their mind about this show. In case you haven't realized it yet, please watch this show, I had enjoyed it very much. Watch this show if you're in for something not as energetic but rather thoughtful... I guess, in it's own way. Honestly you can watch this whenever and it'd be enjoyable. But especially when you're sick of the generic romcom and you want something new and unique.
Story: This will officially be my last paragraph for this review. I had felt as though the story had a meaningful purpose in it, no I don't mean that it had an overall message that would change everybody's lives. I mean the stories in this anime has earnestly gotten you touched. They call the show ""Ping Pong: The Animation,"" but even so, ping pong is simply the canvas for which to paint the stories of these characters onto it. They all have a drive and a purpose, the stories come together and has a very nice touch to it in the end. Every moment of it has purpose and reason. It felt as though the scenes were realistic enough to where you feel sincerely touched. They weren't overtly dramatic like the screaming characters in the casual animes. Yes, I'm talking about Sunohara for one. You can feel sincere emotions and appreciate the realism coming from the show. It's truly a well written show that brings many aspect and elements into it that will truly make you enjoy it. That is the earnest reason why I had enjoyed this show, please, watch it.",9,SovietPsycho
22135,"
                I give this anime 10/10 for everything. I like ping pong, so I went in thinking ""it might be interesting"". I had no idea the emotional rollercoaster that I was strapping myself into. I couldn't wait to finish the series because it's just so good. 
Story 
Excellent plot development, background stories/flashbacks, and the series ends with an excellent wrap up of what the main character's lives look like when they're all grown up.  
Art
At first I was thinking it was weird, but that was only due to the fact that wasn't used to its uniqueness. It is different, but the more I went through
                  the series the more I came to like and eventually love it.
Sound
Normal I guess. I really liked the voices in this series.
Character
All characters are unique and have their own flashbacks and stories behind why they do what they do. Some characters I grew to dislike, like the main antagonist, but by the end of the series I just couldn't pick a favorite. 
Enjoyment
IT'S A BLAST
Overall
I recommend this to anyone who enjoys anime. On the surface it looks like just another sports anime but in reality it's a deeply emotional and really fun anime to watch. Definitely going to rewatch this anime in the not too distant future.",10,Undistributed

                I have been watching animation, of any kind, from USA, Poland, France, Germany, to Japan for about 20 years.
I've seen the disneys, the ghiblis, the chomets.
I don't like to use scores. They're pretty meaningless, since people are different and it's hard to put artistic value to anything. And yet, I did play along sometimes and scored things in my life.
If countless animated projects I've seen in my entire life had score cards from 1 to 10, just like MyAnimeList shows, I now have to rewrite every single animated 10 I have seen in my life into a 9.
Ping Pong is the only one to deserve
                  a 10. I'd be giving it a disservice by putting in anything else.
Now I can only hope I'll ever see another 10. Please watch this series and understand it. The animation, the direction, the stylistic choices, the restraint with using music and everything else you can ever think of - it has all been honed to perfection.
If the last part of the series, showing the enjoyment of doing what you love for the sake of doing it for fun, no matter the injuries, is a metaphor - it'd be one about me, enjoying animation like I never did before.",10,PanRysownik

                Okay so this is my first anime review ever so please bear with me. At first glance this series may seem like a strange find, and due to its art style many find it unappealing at first, but this series certainly proves that art isn't everything to an anime. 
Art: The art style is unique in a word. Many think if the art bad so is the series, but the art style certainly goes well with the story and does catch the watcher's attention.
Music: The Music for this series was just perfect. Each song went well the tense or funny or sad scene. The song
                  I enjoyed the most would have to  be the ending song. After seeing such a good episode leaving us on a cliffhanger or tense scene hearing the ending song would just leave me in awe and give me a hunger for more.
Character: The characters were so well done. All of the characters have a unique personalities that suited their characters very nicely, but the 2 that certainly stand out are Smile and Peco's. Their relationship as hero and robot really made this anime as great as it is.
Overall I found this anime very enjoyable. Many underestimate this anime at first glance due to the art style. But for those who take the chance to watch it and stick to it, you wont regret it.",9,giby1

                Despite the limited possibilities one can go with a sports anime, Ping-Pong the animation has grasped my attention as possibly the best or one of the best sports animes ever. As an actual table tennis player (I play like smile :) I think this show is relatively realistic compared to most sports animes I.e. Prince of Tennis. They managed to pull off an interesting concept for the opening, which wasn't pleasing at first (because it was Rock) but I grew more into it. The soundtrack was decent enough too. I am sorely disappointed by the poor animation, even though I came to love it because
                  of its unique style, so don't let that put you off. As a story, there's only so much you can do in eleven episodes. But the small amount of episodes somehow develops each and every character to hold the storyline together. Overall, a definite must watch, at least because it's ping pong.",8,UltrAnime
22135,"
                UNEXPECTED GREATNESS. Those are the 2 words to sum up the show.
You know how the majority of anime fans have their top 10 anime list all sorted out...well Ping Pong is the anime that will unconventionally just plot itself in your top 10 ranking.
It's the hidden gem of the year. A lot of the people are pushed away by the artwork (which IMO is gorgeous). 
It's a sports anime, that is essentially not really focused on the ""sport"" of the anime. For instance, many sports anime focus on winning the big Cup or trying to be the best player, but no!
Taiyo Matusmoty uses phenomenal story
                  telling and characterization to make such an eloquent story.
The 2 main characters Smile and Peco are best friends from childhood who do not act like the typical best of friends.
The sport of Ping Pong is what brought them together, and by the end of the show is what keeps them together.
The OST was brilliant and you can't forget about that amazing ending song!
In the end, if you want a unique new style of fresh anime, this is the show for you. This deserves much more appreciation and novelty of greatness.",10,senpaicubed

                Intro & Story
We have all heard of successful people who have earned the place through their work and efforts, but do we know what they went through? The success to the top is extremely glorified in this world, but have we seen the pain that is required to reach that spot? Ping Pong the Animation shows the pain and brutality of the top, and it shows us the true struggle. The visceral pain of knowing that you may just not be the biggest fish, which more often than not leads to great self-anguish. This anime asks the viewer how do you define success. Some characters
                  had a goal that ends at one point and some characters had a never-ending goal. Do you want to be the strongest? Do you want to be the best? Do you want to be famous? It could be none of the ones mentioned. Here the anime asks what is important to YOU, and none of these goals are overshadowed by the other. Normally a regular anime would just be vague and answer ""nakama and friendship!"" (which is not bad or anything but it does get jaded after a while). Ironically, Ping Pong is not really about the sport unlike many other anime in its genre, but it is about the struggles our well-developed characters go through as humans to succeed at a personal level. All these characters have their own goals along with great story-telling bestowing it a real spot in my favorites
Characters 
We meet our main protagonist Makoto (Tsuki)moto who is a quiet boy with a stoic looking demeanor  nicknamed ""Smile"" (pretty ironic), and his friend (Hoshi)no or as he is nicknamed ""Peco"" both of these guys are members of their high school Ping Pong team. While (Tsuki)moto plays for fun, (Hoshi)no plays to be best in the world, making two amazing characters. These characters are relative yet opposite to each other like ying and yang, and they also help develop the secondary characters perfectly. These guys are all so different, yet we can all relate to them in one way or another. 
Sound 
I can promise you whenever I hear the OST of Ping Pong I get the chills and it perfectly meshes along with each scene during the anime. It was made by Kensuke Ushio who is not too well known compared the omega popstar Sawano Hiroyuki.
Animation 
Now I seen a lot of people saying that this animation is ""bad"" because it isn't high quality. Does our anime need to look like Fate Zero to be counted as good? We have timeless classics like Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Persona, Metal Gear Solid, Pac-Man, etc, and to this day people are still playing them! Ping Pong's funky art style suits the anime perfectly, and it wouldn't be the same if it had the regular anime art style.
Enjoyment 
I watched this anime three times without experiencing a single second of boredom 'nuff said.
Overall 100/10
I was blown away; A brilliant work for a director who usually makes pretentious anime which is amazing really. I truly believe you should give this beaut a good watch.",10,Freexss
22135,"
                There are really few anime that can truly be called a ""masterpiece."" A masterpiece, a work so unique and interesting that you can watch it a few years later, a few times over and still feel satisfied. These works don't necessarily need to be original but whatever you see, you feel like you're seeing it for the first time and feel this exquisite experience, this throbbing pain and appreciation for its existence. And I strongly believe, Ping Pong The Animation is a work that approaches such caliber. 
The first thing anyone will notice about the anime is its artwork. This ugly, rough, and messy style
                  with minimal shading. It's unconventional and definitely not from this era but it carries so much emotion. The shifts of angles, the swing of the pedal, the motion of the muscles, this art show them gracefully. I'm certainly not an art expert,but there's a reason why people value Picasso's weird characters over images of handsomely drawn humans. It's emotion and messages are what really what sets apart Ping Pong The Animation from other works. The art is not weird for the sake of being unique but it is weird because it has to fit and project the unique plot it was drawn for. 
Ping pong is really not the main focus of the anime, even though the title might suggest otherwise. The focus of this show is on its characters and what they consider important. And coincidentally, what all of these characters have in common is their passion for ping pong. Think from the perspective of an average person. Why do they play sports? To pass time, to establish image, to stay fit or because they love the sport. Most sports anime will shred this view and shrink it to 15 characters who ALL love the sports, whether it is tennis, baseball, or swimming. But Ping Pong sticks to reality and shows the varying motives of players: their little reasons for living, their daily lives, and the source of their inspiration to play ping pong. 
The biggest reason for me to praise this show is its desire to stick to its characters than its plot. People forget what athletes are: humans. Take away their skills, and an athlete is just another average person. There's life before a game and there's a life after the game. There's a beginning and there's an ending. And this true portrayal of sports is what makes the plot so satisfying. You can watch this show few times and you may still wonder who the real protagonist is because how closely this show develop its characters. It shows the rise and fall of monsters, the dazzling beginning and disappointing ending of stars, and it shows the true difference between talent and hard work. 
I am not going to insult the characters by describing them. It's an experience that needs to be seen first-hand. But I can say comfortably that different people choose to live different ways. And it's not uncommon for some to stay in the closet, for some to chase fame, for some to be pretentious, and for some to compete. Ping Pong is a blend and blessing of all kinds of personalities who are tied by a single thread: need for victory. 
""OH YEAH"" is how the opening starts. The music is satisfying. Turn up the beats, and watch the matches, and you'll enjoy the scenes. It's a great experience. The best instance where the music shines is when Mr.Tsukimoto hums this annoying tune. It's so off and tone deaf humming, it's annoying. But you don't understand its true meaning until the last two episodes, where the real instrumental is played in background and you're watching the most intense duel of the masters. Simply, what I am saying is that the music builds up, slowly, like the voice acting and the art..it becomes perfect. 
Ping Pong The Animation is a combination. It's an unique combination of simple art, music, plot, and characters. But it builds from there. The last episode is a crucial part of the series, a valid conclusion that is satisfying if you have sat through the dramatic events of the series. The show has no set say in its protagonist(s) and it certainly doesn't point to a single theme. It brings many things from many other things and it shows how they all fall in a singular place. And portraying such ideas in such unconventional, gradual way with a touch of realism and maturity is what makes this show exquisite. Ping Pong The Animation approaches what can be considered a ""masterpiece"" or perhaps what they call a ""magnum opus"" of the creators. It's perfect in so many ways and I believe a score of 9 is better than giving it a 10.",9,Indolence

                Ping Pong - The Animation, an underdog sports anime of sorts. Ping Pong is promising from the get-go with its fast paced action and resourceful split-frames leaving no idle moments. The animation style is unique and makes use of realistic movement rather than the typical characters only moving their mouth. The surface level plot behind it is also fairly intriguing with quiet and loud ping pong prodigies MC, Hoshino and Tsukimoto. 
Story:
PP:TA leaves nearly no narrative detail unexplained, the story line follows 2 high school boys of opposing personalities and outlooks on life who are tightly connected through the mutual interest of Ping Pong. Their
                  high school team participates in the annual inter-high ping pong competition involving schools locally and internationally, their journey and past is shared as they progress closer to the end of the competition fitting as much details about each other as visually and verbally possible. Doing all that in 11 episodes seems like an interesting idea however, it does mean it'll be slower to process detail on a surface level viewing; most likely requiring one to obsess in order to fully grasp what is occurring (unless you're a literature fanatic with fetishes for dense, unique approaches to the medium) As such, naturally Ping Pong isn't my type of sporting entertainment so it didn't interest me as much. 5/10... 
Art & Sound: 
I've been searching through forums to find why this series is well praised despite its vulnerability to age and change in generations. The art style, mimics a hand-drawn rotorscoped version of real life, there are no fancy ecchi characters or powerful aura that emitts from powerful opponents visually which means this series stays true to life and rather considers the use of different types of film techniques (wide angle, close up etc.) to portray action. That being said, there are a few things that this series may lack in terms of art: shading is very minimal even toward the climax of the series there weren't many hints toward shading which made the characters feel unrealistic and also the smoothness of the animation was questionable for some scenes. Overall art could be considered a 6/10; Sound didn't excel as much either since it is expected to be naturally well constructed 6/10. 
Character:
The one aspect this series excelled phenomenally at was the character development. I always wondered why Tsukimoto's nickname was Smile since his classmates explained that he never smiles and I took that as the textbook reason but the person who began nicknaming him was Hoshino and the main reason was because he actually smiled while learning to play Ping Pong after he had taught Tsukimoto how to play. That level of detail was maintained at the end of the series and could have easily been missed if it was skipped over for a few seconds. The attention to character development in Ping Pong the animation is out of this world, even toward the end character development was maintained with close precision. It's amazing that level of detail would be maintained across all 11 episodes without a drop in quality. 10/10 in character development
Enjoyment: 
Despite being an underdog of sports anime, Ping Pong establishes more of the characters (they even paid attention to using chinese VA as international ping pong opponents instead of using English which was surprising.) However, I personally couldn't find the sports premise as entertaining as a racing anime such as initial D or Kuroko no Basket because they give the viewer comic relief and are tailored to the user-satisfaction. As such, I'd rate 4/10 in terms of enjoyment (I still watched it though, just to give it a chance haha)

                Art: When I first saw the cover art for this show, I was repulsed by the animation style the studio used. This show uses sloppy hand drawn animation (don't know what kind of style it is)--which are often used when a studio wants to depict realistic faces. There are a lot of awkward  faces and postures but as I watched several episodes, it kind of grew on me. After looking past the faults, I have the impression that it was used to make everything look more alive.
Story, Character, and Enjoyment: The series uses the same formula as most shounen sports anime wherein the overarching
                  story is to enter the tournament and become champions, nothing special at first. The great thing about this series though are the characters and how they interact and change as the series progresses. Everyone, including the supporting characters, are a treat to watch. It certainly feels like all them are living, breathing human beings.
Another great thing about the series is how it all ends. Each character has their own circumstances and the viewers gets to see how the characters cope and eventually find what it is that they have to do. No loose ends, just a very solid ending where the viewers are left satisfied.
Every fan of the genre should at least take a look at this series before dismissing it because of its art style. They might find a hidden gem if they did.

                Ping Pong: The Animation is a show that delves into the game of Table Tennis. It explores the subtle techniques of the game, as well as the strategies of the game. However, it tends to separate itself from other sports anime by also delving into the trials and tribulations of it's characters. Throughout the show, we frequently get a peak into each of the characters' everyday lives, and for most of them, things are less than perfect. This provides a nice contrast to the Ping Pong action that happens on the courts.
It's this blend of storytelling that kept me interested until the end... however, it's
                  not simply the fact that they blended them together that makes it work so well. The situations brought up in the story feel incredibly natural, and feel like something that could occur in real life. It grounds the characters and makes them all feel like real people instead of anime characters.
Perhaps part of that has to do with the art style, which has a very distinct look to it. Characters still have some specific design traits to differentiate them from each other, but they all still look like real people, instead of super-characterized anime characters. Some may not appreciate the intentionally rough-looking linework that the show has, but I feel this really adds something to the animation, which is fantastic. The way characters move tends to look very realistic, and this looks especially impressive during an intense ping pong match. The show also frequently shows cut-away panels that focus on different parts of the action, making some scenes appear more manga-like, or like the TV show ""24"". While this is an interesting, distinct, little visual flourish, I also think it's a bit overused.
The characters are well-rounded, and the story really tends to flesh them out. The two main characters, Makoto Tsukimoto and Yutaka Hoshino, show a lot of growth over the course of the show, and it's interesting to follow them on their journey. Not only when it comes to Ping Pong, but also just their journey through life. There's also the main characters' coaches, that both come off as fun, with their own unique charms and personalities. I thought all of the characters were pretty good, and I like how grounded in reality they felt. However, something about many of them just seems very forgettable. Aside from the two main characters and their coaches, I'm not sure I'll actually remember any of the other characters when I think back on the show. Perhaps that just means that the show knew where to focus on, but it also means that the characters end up feeling like the weakest part, despite them all still being well-written.
Finally, I'll just say a few things about the audio. The voice acting is great, and really fits with the tone the show is going for, as well as the characters the actors are portraying. The sound effects are well-used, and during ping pong matches, they're exciting and add a lot to the scene. The music is a well-made, but mostly forgettable score that works well for setting things up and creating tension where it has to... aside from the Opening and Closing themes, that is. The Opening is great, super catchy, easy to sing along to, and it really gets you pumped up for some intense Ping Pong action! The closing is a somber, mellow song, accompanied by images of walking down a sidewalk. They contrast with each other, and tend to perfectly represent the amount of contrast in the show's own storytelling, which I really appreciated.
Overall, the show is well produced. It has a unique art style that looks great and tends to benefit the storyline, and, despite some of them being somewhat unmemorable, it has some interesting characters that remain interesting to the end. The whole thing ends up being incredibly enjoyable, and I would recommend it to just about anybody. It works for people who are just looking for a good sports anime, but also for people who are looking for a well-made coming of age story.",9,vigorousjammer

                I guess itâs all in the way you say it/show it, sometimes is not the clearest of statements the ones that just stay with you.
Ping Pong tells the different stories of different kind of people, whose lives revolve around the sport of Ping Pong (duh). Each and every one of them has a different approach to it, and a different way of seeing it,  from the way itâs played, to how to relate with the scene of the sport, and to the very personal meaning that the effort of high level playing have for the person.
Itâs hard to say from the start what kind
                  of series this is by the way is presented, its contents might seem familiar at first but Ping Pong tries from the very beginning to set the all so elusive effort to ignite our senses and interpretation capabilities, this is automatically noticed by the peculiar animation and drawing style that the series chose to portray and the sudden weirdness in general. 
The thing is, this is not the first, and will not be the last, series to try and catch the eye of the spectator trough bright and weird colors, so that is not the point, the point is that this kind of symbology itâs a way for setting a stage, one that is more open to interpretation than the âregularâ ones, in other words, it is an invitation to get all crooked eyed and see to read every symbol within with another perspectiveâ¦ not exactly the regular one.
Itâs all about how you portray thingsâ¦
The whole sports anime thing is a pretty much standardized field, so the faintest of the efforts to change this are noticeableâ¦ does this mean that such series are necessarily good? Of course notâ¦ does this mean that Ping Pong is bad? Certainly not.
Even after youâve taken in the first impression, that of the visual extravaganza of the series, you are not left with a classic sport story, not even close. Ping Pong offers an interesting twist, not often seen in this genre, in which the story revolves around TALENTED players, so instead of the classic underdog/effort/sacrifice for victory/talent earned kind of story, you are presented with already overpowered talented players with already set personalities that instead of developing they focus on interacting with each other all talking the language of winning and high end competition. This character scenario added to the flamboyant imaginary leaves you with a different language to understand, and thatâs the main beauty of the series, you know the symbol and the codes but are influenced to do a reinterpretation of that which you already know.
Even if you find relatable storylines and scrip scenarios, the whole package is presented in such a way that leaves place to interpretation. Each one of the protagonists will gave you a moment of reflection, all from that comfortable place of talent and superiority, but not compromised by it. In a way you can feel that all the effort on the story telling is purposely made to leave you wondering, every gesture and every struggle gets a makeover in this series, which ends up giving you a wonderful experience as you try to unravel the possible mysteries behind the visual and argumental decisions made in this, not so typical, sport anime.
Itâs funny because me personally did not found any truly complex idea entangled in Ping Pongs presentation, to me it was more about the enticing nature of what I was seeing, even if the result of the experience didnât really left me whit anything new.
In the end, even if you do not find the possible uniqueness in Ping Pong, youâre definitely left with a nice story with fun and complex enough characters to entertainâ¦ even if you arenât prone to dwell too much in the interpretation. Ping Pong makes a strong statement with its contents and presentation, whether we buy it or not.
That doesnât mean it isnât there.",8,Carlzdachu

                Ping Pong the animation is an 'oddity'. Rarely we come across animes which are animated so differently. And this difference 
is what made it so enjoyable and refreshing. 
Story
The story is about Peco(Hoshino) and Smile(makoto);two childhood friends who are always together. Both of them play 
Ping Pong and are really good at it.
Peco dreams of becoming the world champ but he has a swollen head and skips practice believing he is invincible.
On the other hand Smile just plays Ping Pong just for killing time. Both are a stark contrast to each other. Peco has
a happy go lucky attitude while Smile is a silent boy who
                  is often depicted as a robot withno emotions. He is called 
'Smile' because he never smiles(Well its not the real reason;but i don't intend to spoil anything.Smile used to be
bullied as child and it was Peco who always used to save him. The story focuses on their development both as a player
and a human being.
Characters
There are a lot of interesting characters like Kazama, the coach(who speaks English every now and then),The old lady
at the ping pong shop who taught Peco to play Ping Pong, Sakuma(thier childhood friend),Wong(The Chinese player) and 
even though its a small series all of them are given short backstories which makes us feel for them and connect with them.
The character development feels a bit paced but it is completely understandable considering it has only 11 episodes
Animation
Now this is the talking point of this anime. This anime's art is ; in plain words 'Awesome'.  It is unique to Ping Pong! 
The characters , the background are animated in stark contrast to present adaptations. At first it threw me off and I almost
decided to quit watching the series but I am glad I didn't do so because once you start watching the series you understand
the beauty and uniqueness it possess. I loved the how the characters as well as the background was animated. There are no
big eyed girls or the usual coloured hair characters!! They are animated much more realistically.
Sound
Well the opening seemed okay to me but it was the ending that commanded my complete attention! Its really good.
Every matches have different background music which fits perfectly with the mood and the characters. Overall the sound 
was good.
Enjoyment
To be honest I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I never expected it to be so good. And I can understand if people stay 
away from this series due to its art but those people will regret not having watched such a great anime! I am sure grateful
I gave it a try. So folks don't hesitate just watch this!!",10,paulrenson

                Well you see I gave this anime a 10 overall because of my enjoyment. But by no means is every aspect of this show a 10. This show didn't have that interesting a story, characters weren't the most memorable, and by no means was it special in some other aspects. But the things this show had that comepletely hooked me were the animation, art, and the story telling itself. The animeation is so memorable when used with this so very different art style. The art style may at first seem as though little time was put into it but in all actuality it is the
                  exact opposite. The art truely is something different and special. To the average anime fan this may look like shit but for those of us logical enough to see it for what it really is know how special it is. The story telling that this show presented is really the true anchor of the show to me. I truely felt invested in all the characters not because they were something totally new but because the way the story was told and presented. Especially since this show is so short and concise they simply tell the story they wanted to and then it's over. I felt as though I got a truly compelling story from start to finish with this show and in the end that's the main thing I look for in anime. Also I just felt like writing this review because I saw someone gave this show a 3, and this is my first review, so please understand that why this was short and didn't go that in depth.",10,HayHotshot

                At the opening scene of this short series, I knew that I was in for a treat. From the script to the soundtrack to the unconventional animation, it couldnât be anything less than a thrill despite the plotâs focus around a sport I once found quite dull. However, despite my anticipation of greatness, what I walked away with was more than I could have foreseen and for that, this series has worked its way into my top favorite animated jewels.
We open the episodic journey with two boys, both young and naive, and we end with the same pairâs growth into adulthood. Friends since childhood and
                  teammates in high school, the two have a strong relationship, and one that any person might relate to and find emotionally compelling. One child bullied and the other popular, the two were opposites that eventually elicited the best out of one another, unearthing seasoned potential and also, their devotion to the ones and things they care about. The storyâs main focus winds around the twoâs prosperity and the concluding result of such weighty character development leaves you weakened by their strength and love.
Our main protagonist, a distant and downtrodden boy that goes by the nickname Smile is a table tennis player who doesnât share the same desires to succeed and improve as his close friend Peco; simply, he seemingly plays for no fundamental reason which hinders his potential of accomplishing feats and meeting standards that otherwise could be achieved. 
Through the series, we watch as Smile is personally taken under the wing of his high schoolâs, table-tennis coach, a gruff, 70-something with plenty of dedication and love to spare. Side by side, they train to lift Smile to a higher level of competition. Together, Smile and his coach build and hone in the boyâs potential and are eventually rewarded with a spot in the countryâs national table tennis tournament. 
While Smile trains alongside his coach, Peco takes a different route. Guided by an elderly woman who once fiercely competed in ping pong herself, Peco finally finds the gumption to emerges from his chrysalis, a gorgeous, proud and strong player after rigorous months of training and a ripe does of character insight.
By the concluding episodes of this wonderful series, I was left clinging to the edge of my seat, drinking in both the brilliant animation style and the story of these fleshed out characters. Each moment is gorgeous and meaningful. Scene per scene, Ping Pong the Animation continuously delivers some of the best script writing and progression Iâve seen in a series so short.
This piece will steal your heart away with its dynamite style, its intelligent writing, the wonderful soundtrack and the characters that coincide with such brilliant elements. Despite this not being a particularly sorrowful piece, I was left with tears trailing down my cheeks as the series came to its end due to the emotional weight it evokes. Here, in this story, I found motivation, wisdom and words that personally unveiled my own desire to make something of myself.
This is not simply a sports story, but one of friendship and love. What we learn through each character, even the side rolls, is that everybody is afraid of something and this weakness, this fear of the unknown, is what grounds us; to fly, we must believe in ourselves and overcome the hurdles that life tosses our way.",10,impertinenthawk

                This is not a show that I would normally have watched but for the fact that it was, very considerately, and thoughtfully, recommended to me (MAL Secret Santa 2015). So if it's not something you would usually watch, allow me to highly recommend that you still give it a try too. Here's why:
Story: 10
The beats of the story, the story development, is kinda like poetry. There's a repetition of abstract, often metaphorical, foreshadowing, that blossoms at its climax into an enlightening whole. And like some poetry my first impression was kind of awkward because I didn't quite understand the meter, or some of the meaning.
                  But also like poetry, once I caught on to it I fell in love. It's got great narrative style. But also, it's simply great storytelling. In true sports anime fashion, it deals in themes of perseverance, victory, defeat, injury, strategy, etc. But there's also a deep tension between the complete devotion of all time and energy to a single passion and the nature of what, or whom, must be sacrificed for such devotion; and whether doing so is running towards a goal or running away from something else; and whether no longer doing so means being free or being directionless. As someone who has experienced moving on from a sport that drove my spirit for many years, I really appreciated this.
Art: 10
The art had me all tied up in knots for the first couple of episodes. On the one hand, it didn't feel like watching anime at first. (Which, by the way, goes against my belief in anime as a medium rather than a genre! Gosh I'm such a hypocrite. But that's human nature I guess.) It sort of felt like watching animated Picasso. And there is actually an element of truer-than-life distortion that's a bit reminiscent of Picasso. It's not such a literal or anatomical distortion, but it's there in the lines and the perspective. On the other hand...it sort of felt like watching animated Picasso. I mean, Picasso's work is strange but it's genius and inspiring. You just have to look at it hard enough and long enough. For me, once it clicks it's insanely poignant. Ok. So the style of art in ""Ping Pong"" isn't literally like Picasso. I just felt the faintly similar vibe while watching it, and thought it might make a nice comparison to explain what I see in the art that merits a 10. 
Poetry. Picasso. A little hard to grasp at first, but truly meaningful and a lot of fun once you get into it. But mixed in with these artsy elements there's some fun and classic charm points too.
Sound: 10
There were some very clever uses of sound in the storytelling that really struck me. And overall, the sound effects are very crisp and bright - a perfect reflection of the classic sound (which we of course hear a lot) of ping pong balls. There's also some humorous and fun but subtle use of sound effects. Last but not least, the music has a lot of good beats - again a nice nod to the sound of a game of ping pong. The sound of the series is actually a lot of fun.
As a transition from sound to character, let's talk about the voice acting. I'd say the voice actors were subtly superb. A current of dry humor was particularly brilliant, especially from Yara Yuusaki as Coach Koizumi and Nozawa Masako as Tamura Obaba. 
Character: 10
I loved the characters from the very beginning. The main duo, childhood friends Hoshino and Tsukimoto, have a really fascinating friendship. It's not just like they're brothers, it's like they're brothers who are ninety years old and know each other the better for those long years. Hoshino's eccentricity and kinetic spiritedness contrasts Tsukimoto (nicknamed ""Smiles""), whose wavering between apparently listless indifference and intensely quiet passion always keeps you on your toes. The mentors, Koizumi who is the coach at the boys' school and Tamura who keeps the dojo where they grew up playing, are sort of humorously cranky about being the trainers rather than the good old days when they were the players. But their silliness of passion and witty sense of humor were a real joy. Then there are the characters who can be described as teammates and rivals and secondary characters, but who might best be described as characters who were affected by the two main boys. Their backstories and character arcs were treated with as much care, if not as much spotlight, as the main characters, and the way they were affected by the main characters might actually be the main point of the story.
Enjoyment: 9
The only reason this isn't a 10 is that I had to work into the right headspace at first to truly enjoy this series. I'm guessing the next time (or few times) I watch it my enjoyment will be a 10. 
Overall: 10
Although I might be slightly maybe a little tiny bit hypocritical about it at times, I really believe in animation that has an extremely, individually unique style. The world of illustration has a great, extreme variety of style and characterization. You can tell just by glancing at some illustrations who the artist is. I hope animation can become even more this way. There are some great examples in anime. And ""Ping Pong: The Animation"" is one such example.",10,KaguyaSenshi

There are many philosophies when it comes to sport and competition. Do you play to win or do you play not to lose? Do you value winning over everything, or do you consider the relationships you build through competition and teamwork more important? Can effort win out over talent? Itâs questions like these that Ping Pong the Animation revolves around. 
Based on the manga by Taiyou Matsumoto (Tekkon Kinkreet) and directed by the phenomenal Masaaki Yuasa (The Tatami Galaxy, Kaiba, Mind Game), Ping Pong the Animation aired during the Spring 2014 season and ran for 11
                  episodes. 
The story of Ping Pong the Animation revolves around the characters Yukata Hoshino and Makoto Tsukimoto, also known as ""Peco"" and ""Smile"" respectively. It tells the tale of not only their experience in competitive ping pong, but also the story of complex concepts like the burden of winning, the folly of wasted talent, and what it truly means to compete. 
The characters of Ping Pong are very complex and represent the varying philosophical approaches to sporting, and also the values they hold. Smile represents technical prowess and the nihilistic approach to sporting. He plays table tennis to kill time. Peco represents talent and the speed approach to sporting. He relies on speed and energy, and plays only to win. Wenge is more of a dreamer, and represents the burdened approach to sporting. He seems to always be looking ahead, and plays for establishing social status. Kazama represents obsession and the burden of winning. He is so obsessed with table tennis that it basically consumes him, to the point where his victories feel hollow and all he feels from the sport is pain. Demon is the embodiment of pure effort, and represents the competitor who isn't talented but works harder than anyone to overcome his handicap. Lastly, there's Butterfly Jo. Jo represents the social side of sporting, valuing the relationships built through competition above winning or anything else.
Each character is explored and studied in incredible detail and each endures their own trial they have to overcome to grow as not only athletes, but as people. By the end of the show, the final match between Peco and Smile barely even matters. Peco's trainer says this herself, and she's completely right. In fact, they only show 2 points of the entire match. The sport itself was never the complete focus: it was about the people that make the sport what it is. 
The art of Ping Pong is vivid, fluid, and bursting with energy. The character designs are fantastic and represent visually each character perfectly. Just like The Tatami Galaxy and Kaiba (Yuasa's other works), the art and animation of Ping Pong set it apart from everything else without being a distraction.
From the opening song to the ED, the music of Ping Pong is fantastic. The opening itself (""Tada Hitori"" by Bakudan Johnny) embraces the fire of competition and spits it back out in a frenetic burst of energy. The soundtrack is filled to the brim with interesting and bizarre pieces, with perfect music placement present throughout the entire show. 
Ping Pong the Animation is a masterpiece. From the brilliant character development and internalization of its themes to the clever symbolism and dynamic art style, Ping Pong is a landmark in the sports anime genre and yet another reason to count Yuasa among anime's greatest directors of all time. It's engaging, exciting, smart, and incredibly entertaining.

Ping Pong the Animation is a show about the game Ping Pong, but it actually isn't. Rather it's more used as a catalyst for the characters, who all struggle with something about life. The show does go into some depth on techniques and styles, but they don't delve too much into it. Just like any seinen anime would, the show will be using the game Ping Pong to convey its message. And it delivers it extremely well.

                  on the characters nor the environment. In fact the art looks like it was drawn without realism in mind. And that fact alone makes the art style very unique and interesting. You still know that the artists and animators put in a lot of effort in each episode in spite of the crude art style, and in the end it's very appreciated. At times it does get a little hard to discern what's what, but this isn't the issue. This is another thing that the style works wonders. It convinces the viewer to take in the moment, not worrying over the subtleties. And in spite of the cruelties, the emotions the characters have are still conveyed without much problem.
The animation is free-flowing as well. During matches it still maintains the crude style but the action goes up a notch to match the tension of a game. At times even the sequencing goes into a manga-like state, where each box can represent a technique or the strains of a character. 
Story - It's pretty difficult to review this aspect without going into spoilers, because as I said earlier the story is solely on character development. Even though this anime is only 11 episodes long, the story is incredibly fleshed-out
As this is a Seinen, it'll deal with life and be very mature about it. Ping Pong the Animation will deal with five people, all around high school age. And everyone should know the teen sentiments at this age: What should I do with my life? What do I want out of it? Each character struggles with these questions, and the game of Ping Pong helps establish their answer. Thus these characters will grow more and more each episode. Even if one tries their hardest but still lose, anyone can learn from what they got out of it and see a new day. This is exactly what this show does, creating a very mature atmosphere around a relatively simple game of Ping Pong. As I said earlier, Ping Pong serves more as a catalyst for the characters and drives the plot forward more than the technicalities of the sport. 
The pacing actually slows down in many parts of the show. Not in a way that breaks the show or is used as ""filler"". In fact this slowing down helps establish that the people involved are just normal human beings. They know the little nuances of life and use it as a way to push something out of themselves and ultimately enjoy life itself. 
Characters - As I said earlier, character development is a key aspect in this show. Since this show is tagged as Seinen, the characters will surely be flesh-and-blood and down-to-earth. And they are. Every character will have a journey of their own, dealing with what they're struggling with. The only way to experience these characters is to see it for yourself. 
These characters can literally walk out of the screen and exist in real life. It's outstanding how these characters go about their struggles with the game of Ping Pong, learn from it, and make do with their problems. Even the side characters will support the main ones, having a change of their own. The friendship between Smile and Peco. Kong's homesickness. In one way or another every character is quite relatable. 
Sounds - The OP and ED work very well for the atmosphere. The OP has a more exciting tone to it, while the ED moves into a more reflective sort of tone. Exactly matches how the pacing goes in each episode. 
Enjoyment - I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it. I can watch it multiple times and still get enjoyment out of it. These characters become extremely relatable, and you'll grow affection for each person and with their hardships. Ping Pong the Animation takes a spin at the Sports genre. And it's a very, very good spin at it.",10,Technycolor

I'll just say this first, itâs nothing less than a perfect masterpiece
Plot:
""The hero comes. The hero comes. The hero comes. Chant these words in your mind, and I'll surely come to you..."" 
This mantra is what Makoto Tsukimoto repeats as a source of motivation when he fights through the stress of not only gruelling ping pong matches, but also in situations of his life. Makoto doesn't fight alone; he and his friend, Yukata Hoshino, nicknamed âSmileâ and âPecoâ respectively, are two boys who have grown up playing ping pong together nearly every day. Peco, brimming with confidence, aims to be the best table tennis player
                  in the world; Smile, on the other hand, shows little ambition. Nevertheless, the two have always stuck together, with a bond built upon their mutual love for this sport.
The story is simple and linear, anyone can easily understand. Story of two high school boys, and their journey with ping pong, which is showcased perfectly, in just 11 episodes. Everything from start to finish is put together in such a perfectly woven mesh, with each episode providing just enough info to keep the audience hooked to the show without any confusion.
The major theme of the anime is âwhy do you play ping pong?â, âfor who do you play ping pong?â. Each character has their answer for these questions and backstories, which help the audience to understand the characters perception, expectation, dreams, and suppressed emotions.
 Animation:
The animation is the best part of the entire series, itâs the main factor that decides whether someone will absolutely be blown away by the anime or feel as if this anime was a mistake. However, if you are a veteran weeb you will probably find this as a phenomenal show. The anime didnât have a lot of vibrant colours, artistically drawn backgrounds, sexy character designs, huge detailed and mesmerizing eyes or faces.
But what it had was one of a kind, something which makes it stand out of the crowd, which makes it unique. The animation is majorly black and white hand-drawn lines edited frame by frame, raw and stunning, the characters and ping pong games were traced from real matches and shown in the anime in their own peculiar and distinct animation style.
Somewhat like Kizumonogatari. And the way that animation is used, in a simple game of ping pong, is what makes it so captivating.
If one can convey a personâs inner turmoil, emotions and inner thoughts through the medium of a ping pong game, you know itâs something special. 
The animation is unorthodox when I say raw, I mean raw, like the shape of the ping pong isnât even a perfect circle. But it fits the show like a glove, it is just impeccable for what the show wants to convey. 
Characters and theme:
The psychological/emotional aspect is comparable to Gatsu no lion In aspects regarding the protagonists and what the sport means to them, how are they connected to the sport and its importance. This helps us understand the character, a similar thing is seen here, but rawer in its presentation. 
Every major character undergoes development, realising what the sports means to them, for what they have been fighting for so long, why were they lying to themselves, what were their hidden emotions, were their decisions right, what is it that they want, and in the end, itâs all about finding themselves.
Like we have an actual character who lost a game of ping pong in the starting episodes, then goes around the world trying to find his passion, his calling, and in the end realises, in the last episode, that it was ping pong he was looking for this whole time.
The characters are very well made, you might be able to relate to someone, with no plot hole or loose threads concerning their part in the story or their backstories. 
The very dialogues and conversation in the anime felt very natural, genuine, realistic. The development in 11 episodes is not an easy task but they pulled it off with just precise pacing and changing things as the show progressed.
Sound:
The OST is different from what would be expected in a sports anime, but it didnât disappoint once. It was suiting and changed when they were playing a ping pong match, enjoying themselves, feeling sad, monologues, even when they were in between a match and their feelings surfaced, it was fairly good.
Conclusion:
This is without a doubt one of the best anime ones can find have seen in under 15 eps. Here we have a psychological sports anime, flawless animation, excellent OST, characters with depth and proper development, and a thought-provoking theme. You just have to watch this show. Overall a light watch, very entertaining and hard not to binge.
If you want something for a change from everyday normal anime, something light where everything makes sense and makes you feel good, go for this one without a doubt.
The anime is by the same director for Devilman Crybaby, Yuasa Masaki, and once again this guy has shown me something noteworthy and unique. 
Itâs a must-watch for every weeb out there, just get the timing right. Like if you are new to anime, donât watch it as the art and animation may be very different for you, given demon slayer is your favourite anime. For a weeb who has seen quite a lot of stuff, and is bored with current animation in the industry, and every day shows we see, this might be for you. Just take a look at the anime opening animation, you will know if it is time for you or not.",10,MrWEEBX

Tsukimoto been a victim of school abuse since childhood and decided the best way to deal with those abusers is to choose ignorance by concealing himself and hide, until a ""Hero"" arrived.
Yutaka Hoshino ""Peco"", loves table tennis and eagers to be a national and worldwide champion. 
Tsukimoto and ""Peco"" are best friends and always like to meet to play after school at a nearby table tennis center. While both loves table tennis, Tsukimoto has no interest into taking it seriously as
                  Peco does, and just using it as a way for passing time.
The two friends loves to play most days that way until their bond of friendship encounters a certain road block and at this time you begin to understand how deeply their friendship bond tied up in the past.
The way this work shows of this bond of friendship, the passion towards table tennis and the reason why they both love playing against each other is just so extraordinary.

                   Ping Pong the Animation comes very close to being a masterpiece, but is lacking in the visuals. It is a mixture of hard character development, great action, and in depth look into sports and table tennis. 
   The story is perfect for 11 episodes. Everything at the end was concluded; all threads were tied and the viewer is left feeling satisfied. 10/10.
   The OST for ping pong is one of my favorites. The intense opening and ""battle"" themes really set the mood for the action sequences. There are appropriate slower songs for the sad moments, and other niche
                  songs that fit well. Give the soundtrack a listen to after watching it. 10/10
   The characters are what you'd expect from a sports anime: there's ""hero"" who develops his skills due to his persistence and support; the anti-hero who strives for the same goal as the hero, but takes a different path; the sage who guides our hero's, etc. They all fit together nicely, and left me rooting for multiple characters. 10/10
   I enjoyed this anime without any table tennis experience or knowledge prior, and with some experience for my re-watch. 10/10, i cri errytime.
   The animation is the only wavering factor in my mind. Some call it masterful due to its charm that fits the show so well, some call it too low budget that ruins the rest of the experience. I am with the former; however, I accept the criticisms towards it as reality. It may not look that good at first, but after a few episodes, the animation quality isn't worse, just different. 6/10
   Even if you hate sports anime, Ping Pong is still a masterpiece in it's genre. A strong contender for AotY for 2014, and one of my favorite anime I've seen to date. 9.6/10",9,EpicSawce

                I recently decided to watch Tatami Galaxy and after finishing the first episode I marathoned the whole thing. I looked into who was the director and it was Masaaki Yuasa. His work was so phenomenal, I checked what other anime heâs directed and Ping Pong the animation was one of them.
Many people have been recommending me to watch Ping Pong for a while now so I thought itâs two flies with a one swat if I watch it now. Oh boy that was one of the best decisions Iâve done.
Ping Pong the animation tells us a story of multiple high schooler ping pong players and
                  their coming of age story. Our two main protagonists Peco and Smile have been playing since they were little. Peco is confident, arrogant and talented pong player who introduced our other main character Smile to the game. Smile on the other hand is a very melancholic, bored and lonely person looking for a hero to save him. Reason to his behavior is later told in the story. Peco has always been a  ping pong prodigy and has never really practiced. Smile on the other hand is also good in ping pong but heâs always decided to stay in Pecoâs shadow.
There are other characters as well, for example Kong Wenge a chinese player exiled to Japan, looking to win tournaments to get back on track and return home. He was my favorite character because in a way he was so relatable, struggling with the idea of talent vs hard work.
Even though the anime is named Ping Pong the Animation, Itâs much more than just a story about the game. It introduces us to all these characters, their personal issues, dreams and hopes. When the show is over you might wonder was this about ping pong at all. I think thatâs what the creator wants us to think.
The animation in this anime is beautiful, it has this raw power and rough around the edges but it is fluid in itâs own way. The art style has divided people in two camps where others absolutely love it and others dislike it. I personally belong to those people who loved it, after the first episode I kinda got hooked in to it. The style allows the characters to show emotions more clear and human which is very centered theme in this show.
Music in this anime is legendary, I canât even count how many times Iâve re-played the OST. The ending theme and Ping Pong Phase 1 & 2 are my absolute favorites. Thereâs also song that I wont link because of spoilers but that one made me shed a tear.
Overall Ping Pong the Animation is a work of art and will be remembered as a masterpiece inside the medium.
Positives
+ Gorgeous art and animation
+ Relatable and realistic cast
+ Chillingly good OST

                Ping Pong The Animation is a really good show. The art quality is poor, and characters may be a bit cold and hard to understand, but it was rather enjoyable, with certain comical reliefs and plenty of action. Unlike other sports anime I've watched, I didn't know anything about table tennis. This anime taught me quite a lot about it.
Story & Characters: 9/8
The story was pretty good and straightforward. I liked that it was simple enough to follow, but not slow and boring at the same time. The only issue I had with it was the characters. It was quite hard to figure who the
                  protagonist(s) was/were. Though their use of foreshadowing and plot twists was able to keep me entertained throughout the whole show.
Sound: 10
I loved the opening song in this anime, as well as the voice actors and sound effects. The BGM (Background Music) really helped intensify the more passionate scenes in this anime.
Art: 4
Though I'm not usually picky about this aspect, the fact that the characters looked like some fifth grader had designed them kind of put me off. Though the worst part was the inconsistencies in the level of art. It didn't go up from the first episode, however it did drop a lot throughout certain scenes like the training ones, and classroom scenes.
Enjoyment & Overall: 9/8

Ping Pong the animation is an incredible show. The characters, story, music... all... is really amazing. I love and hate the fact that the studio take the risk with the animation style, because a lot of people, like me at first, only focus on the style of animation and not give him a chance and donÂ´t know they are missing a beautiful story. All the characters and his development in so few chapters is amazing, and you can be proud of all the characters at the end.
The symbolism are really important and chapter by chapter you wonder who is the hero
                  and when it shows, you get excited and many things make sense. The sport isnÂ´t important like the charas development, so you will not care who wins the match.

                Ping pong... really? A sport with little glamor but quite a bit of drama, especially in Asian countries, it is hardly flashy as a sport. Naturally, I was curious how they could make a sports anime out of it. They didn't. They made a masterpiece.
This is a true coming-of-age story with a set of likeable characters and characters you love to hate and then love to love. Almost every character is well developed, and that's saying a lot for 11 episodes. Many of the characters' progress meets in that unheard of median of being both natural and profound, the mark of amazing storytelling.
The art style
                  is different, but I think it matches the sport of choice perfectly; and every now and then, the animation is super upgraded as you see the ball glancing off the paddle in full HD. You have to watch it to understand.
Just like when watching Olympic-level ping pong, you can't help but keep watching players grind into the ground and into each other in little quick turns of the body. It's a bit strange to say because the animation is hardly such, but this anime is extremely lifelike in this respect. This is definitely the feeling of ping pong. This gritty, real feeling is usually absent in sports anime, yet so beautifully portrayed here. I had to give this anime a 10. Even though I watched Ping Pong over a year ago, the imagery still resonates in my mind.
If you're hesitant to watch Ping Pong because of the sport, the genre, or the animation style, please don't be. You would only miss out on something surprisingly poetic and refreshing.",10,yhyhyhkt

The art for this show is unique; it stands out. At first you may find it weird and offsetting. But as the episodes pass, you'll find a certain comfort, a certain familiarity with it. The rough art style grows on you, then you'll find yourself loving and wanting more of it. Sometimes, different is better.
As you delve into the rich story of the show, you're accompanied by its music, its soundtrack. It surrounds you, and sets the atmosphere perfectly for any scene. Superb opening and ending theme songs also greet and bid you farewell respectively at each
                  episode. In a word, the music is phenomenal.
The characters are Ping Pong's strongest point. All are of different backgrounds, and of different experiences who are met with each other through Ping Pong. They have their own personality, yet how each one complements or clashes with the others' was gracefully executed. Encounters change people.

                Preface:
 	More of a character study than a sports anime. Ping Pong the Animation takes a ton of risks with its art, and with how each player develops mentally as the face the trials and tribulations of becoming a ping pong professional
Story: 8/10
 	The story is really simple plot point wise, but the moments of character clarity and psychological breakdowns really transform the basic competition story. Smile and Peco childhood friends both become enraptured with the sport, and train to be the very best. They hit quite a few road block along the way, some life shattering, and those are the greatest parts of Ping
                  Pong. The abstract and avant garde daydreams run wild, with vivid imagery and thought proving philosophies. The actual matches or outcome of the matches arenât as important as the emotions and perspectives that are created during the game. None of the characters are one dimensional, even though how short this series is they spend a just amount of time fleshing out character motivations to point where you even care about the opponents Smile and Peco face along the way with most being serious and one comical. 
Characters: 9/10
 Smile (AKA: Tsukimoto, Makoto):
	Smile is a shut off teenager, who confines himself to being in the background and to not give a damn about anything. Being bullied because of his seemingly robotic actions, Smile is always on the defensive never really taking matters into his own hands until his coach pushes him over the edge. He then becomes a ping pong robot destroying the competition in his path. Smile while says very little is a really interesting character, you want to root for him even when his natural born ping pong talent gets the better of his ego.
Peco (AKA: Hoshino, Yutaka):
 	Peco is the protege who everyone looked up to due to his innate talent. One day after ditching practice in order to spy on him Chinese player, Kong, Wenge, plays a match against Peco. Peco is shut out completely and is completely devastated. He loses sight of why he enjoyed ping pong and gives up the sport completely, but after remembering why he got into the sport in the first place, he shapes ups and trains to become great once again. Peco is incredibly cocky at the beginning and at first I wasn't sure what I thought of his character, but after learning more about his friendship with Smile I became assured that he was a good person and a great friend. 
Animation/ Art style: 9/10
 	Ping Pong looks like a comic book come to life, the multiple transitioning panels in each frame create a great sense of movement and excitement. The characters all look really weird, and kind abstract. They definitely donât look pretty but they are really engaging and eye catching due to how often they change and how unprofessional and messy the line work on the characters look. The backgrounds look like they were done in watercolor, with varying degrees of colors used on every object and item in the frame. Sometimes the characters and backgrounds objects look so light and soft that the watercolor within them could burst and spill all around the shot. The only nitpick I have is that sometime the characters look so bad and messy that even I could draw them. Also the animation during the ping pong matches is fantastic, and makes up for the conversation scenes where they skimp a bit on the animation. This is for sure the best thing about Ping Pong, and it is so close to being perfect, but I just canât give it that immaculate of a rating but its really really close to being a 10. 
Sound: 6/10
 	The Opening was enjoyable the first two times around but it became too much the more I saw it. The ending music contrasts the opening nicely, and is a nice relaxing calm down after the hectic episode that preceded it. None of the background music during the show really jumped out at me, so overall nothing all that great here, but the opening is decent at least.
Enjoyment: 8/10	
 	Ping Pong the Animation surprised me by actually being a deep and thought provoking anime centered around ping pong. The art is ingenious and gorgeous in regards to the background and environments. The characters were easy to root for and actually progressed in ways that were satisfying as hell to watch. The only thing lacking a bit is the overarching ping pong plot, and the sound or really music in general. Ping Pong should be thought of as better and more meaningful than most sports anime, and should be watched by anyone who wants to stare at eye candy for a too short eleven episodes.",8,scottpilgrim10

                There have always been a lot of sports anime/manga, ranging from basketball to boxing. But one particular sport is always forgotten: ping pong, or table tennis. Ping Pong The Animation tries to remedy that while telling a griping story of personal evolution and maturation.
Ping Pong The Animation is the adaptation of the manga Ping Pong, originally released in the 80s. It was produced by the Tatsunoko productions studio and aired in 2014 with 11 episodes.
While the premise may seem boring and unimaginative, I assure you it is actually incredible. There is no bigger plot here, the story is based in character development, and it nails
                  it. Every character is unique, has a distinct personality, is wonderfully developed and changes throughout the story, for better or for worse. Smile and Peco's friendship is beautifully explored. The conclusion is very fitting for the series and shows us a glimpse of what the characters are up to after the ending.
Its art style is unique, to say the least. It is very hard to describe, but I will try my best. The lines are frequently wobbling, things sometimes get blown out of traditional proportions and the matches themselves are pretty trippy, showing metaphorical representations of the players. But everything thing is done for a clear reason and it never feels pretentious. It still may be a tur-off for some people, and I don't blame them.
Speaking of the matches, differently from some other anime, the matches are very much grounded on reality and don't include any flashy moves. Knowledge of ping pong is not needed in any way whatsoever.
The soundtrack, consisting mostly of highly energetic songs, is also pretty great, especially the OP that is, in the lack of a better expression, filled with energy. Just like the art, every track is put for a particular reason and has some effect on the viewer.
The only real fault I could find with the anime was the poor pacing of the middle arc, which happens between two very important tournaments. It suddenly became painfully slow and kind of boring, but thankfully the steam came back in the last arc.
While it is not as flashy as Kuroko no Basket, for example, Ping Pong The Animation does manage to tell a powerful story with hugely interesting characters. It is a definite recommendation to anyone looking for phenomenal character development.",9,Keatle

                At first glance, many may scoff at ""Ping Pong The Animation"" for its incredibly different art style. As understandable as this disdain is,  it is only these people who judge too quickly that suffer. Released in the spring of 2014, the initial perceived shortcomings relating to its genre and art style quickly evaporated after its coming of age story gripped the hearts of many. With exceptional pacing, fantastic characters, and thought provoking themes, ""Ping Pong The Animation"" is a show that's hard to forget. 
The structure, the foundation, the frame; the story is an incredibly important part of any show. It provides the basis
                  for which the other elements can stand upon, without a story, there is no show. ""Ping Pong The Animation"" 's story a perfect example of this foundation, and it executes it incredibly well. The pacing was brilliant, with no dull moments. 11 episodes is not very many, but it feels like there are even less. Even   important responsibilities of mine went by the wayside as I was so invested into the show.  What really stands out with this story though is the way it is able to tell each character's arc. The overall structure allows for some great moments of character defining decisions that are so essential to complex and likable characters. Without a structure this strong, many aspects of the show may have fallen apart. 
Next, the art, being one of its most divisive aspects, can be sometimes one of its biggest strengths, and other times its weakness. In some scenes, characters seen in the background are completely lifeless, and seem roughly sketched. Although this isn't the biggest of deals, it is incredibly distracting and I often found myself more fixated on how out of place everything in the background was instead of the main characters and their dialogue. All this being said, some of the most enjoyment I had out of the show also came from its animation. In its best moments, especially seen during the ping pong sequences, the characters seem so alive, and the energy is palatable. There are no shortcuts being taken, and every hit is understood, as well as felt. Combined with the split screen style to effectively show more of the action without quick cuts, I found myself being unable to stop smiling.
It wasn't just the animation that produced this pure glee though, it was also the sound design. Each hit of the ping pong ball had a clear and resonant pop, the sound of the gymnasium had a certain organized chaos,  and the squeak of the sneakers evoked memories of high school gym class. The level of detail was so high, that I was able to tell, without looking, the style of a player entirely based off of the sound. In addition to sound design, the music was fantastic. The OP was a driving rock tune that excited with its melody, and also hinted at some of the shows deeper themes with its lyrics. The music played during the show itself was also great, matching the mood of each situation it played in. Overall, both the music and sound design were exceptional. The level of detail shown in each elevates the show to a level of quality I'm hard pressed to find in any medium.
Along with the sound design, what really elevates this show is the characters. Hoshino, Tsukimoto, Kong Wenge, Kazama, all incredibly complex characters that have relatable, dramatic arcs that both tug on our heart strings, and make us leap for joy. Hard Work vs. Talent, goals, selflessness, success, all themes shown through these incredible characters. They are flawed and broken, and what makes this show incredibly human is the way it expertly places these characters in situations to make them make decisions that either help them overcome these flaws, or succumb to them. Characterization isn't learned through exposition, it's learned through the characters themselves, and the choices they make. The side characters are fantastic as well, some serving as a foil to the main characters, and others even having some slight arcs of there own. Overall, this is a character based show, and the characters are incredible. Few characters in any medium have forged such an effective connection to me than these do. With deep themes, relatable attributes, and choice based characterization, I was able to both grin, and weep along with these characters
My enjoyment of this show can be described as nothing less than off the charts. Despite its slight flaws in animation quality at places, I was fully immersed in the characters and their actions through the all too short 11 episode run. The ping pong matches were exciting, the character moments were emotionally powerful, and the sound design kept me consistently impressed. I will never forget Peco, Smile, Kong, and Kazama, and I will never forget this show.",9,Plardwich

                If you don't want to read this long review, scroll down to the bottom line.
If you cannot see past this art style, you are ignoring what QUALITY really is. The story development and character arcs reach the single point of god, the artstyle isn't even BAD, it creates the definition of story. Would you even take this anime seriously if the artstyle had all of the characters look like moe loli? i don't think so
It BAFFLES me this anime, it reaches character development deeper than the pits of the universe in 11 episodes. Something that isn't even PARALLELED in any mainstream anime within THOUSANDS of
                  episodes. The artstyle isn't flashy like jojo, which in itself is a extremely well crafted style. It's use of realism and subtle color changes puts itself equal to jojo's artstyle but vastly different. 
Honestly this artstyle is refreshing; it doesn't follow the same ""industrial"" stereotypical overtly sexual obsessive bs. I could speak miles about the extreme sexualization of anime and how it constantly churns the same story over and over again, but that takes away from this anime. 
Every match they have, they use these stories to convey the emotional weight both characters are carrying into their match, no one is truely evil in this anime; they all have their stories and they are all human; we can empathize with every single players story and we want both of them to win. But the out come of each match only allows one person to win. These GOD DAMN STORIES convey SO MUCH MORE than a simple ""hit ball with paddle game"", all of the characters PROGRESS with their life. They get BETTER at the game, they LEARN life LESSONS.
TL:DR
This review has slowly turned into a rant, so I'm going to end with this, when is the last time; that all of the characters had STORIES to their persona; when was the last time that they PROGRESSED in life; When's the last time they LEARN LIFE LESSONS.",10,folder123

                Although the plot started off as mediocre it gradually began its descent into below average. By the end of the show the plot became illogical and absurd.
The shounen-esque approach of the plot was the downfall of the series as a whole. Also I enjoyed how they did the last episode although I didn't particularly like the plot the way they did the episode made was great.
Story 4/10
The Animation was unique so I enjoyed that part of it but it didn't blow me away.
Art 6/10
Smile is the typical ""emotionless"" character and Peco is the typical Shounen protagonist. Not much to be praised there. Kaiou academy players
                  and the trio of the elders in the show bring a sense of relief to the stereotypical main characters. 
Character 7/10
The OP was the only thing memorable in the soundtrack, everything else was average at best.
Sound 7/10
I enjoyed the beginning of the series alot so I have to give it a 7 here because It still was enjoyable but just fell off towards the end
Enjoyment 7/10
Overall fairly disappointed in the anime given how well it started and the potential it had but at the end of the day I cant complain because it was still a decent anime.
Overall 7/10
Edit: Rewatched the anime a couple years later and enjoyed it more the second time. The story was still lackluster to me but the execution was good. The art is very unique and was great for animating ping pong even though there were hiccups somethimes. The sound was decent, the opening and ending being the stand outs. The supporting cast of characters re what make the show shine, kazama , kong, sanada etc are magnificient characters and smile and peco's character development were great. I liked how the show concluded but dont like the result of the interstate tournament. Probably why I can never even think aboutgiving this show a 10",9,Chiefmiest

                I do not particularly like sports animes, but I make this exception. Ping Pong: The Animation it's an underrated masterpiece. Complex and realistic, this series shows us the life of those who dedicate their lives to a sport, but can be applied to any aspect of life that involves some kind of competitiveness.
Story. Well written, complete, fascinating. 10/10.
Art. Please, don't judge this anime for its art. Even though it's not the best aspect of the series, it's intriguing and remarks the realism of the series and the characters. 8/10.
Sound. Each song complements wonderfully the events of the series, especially the emotions of the characters and
                  their inner change. 10/10
Characters. Every single character is perfect and well developed. In my opinon, this is the best aspect of the series. The fact that each character has a complete, consistent story and an amazing emotional evolution, makes this anime a masterpiece. 10/10.

                With the recent influx of reviews that are of anime airing this season, I thought that I'd review a lesser known show, a show that in my opinion, is truly a masterpiece and I find it a shame that many have not even heard of this anime. This anime would have to be Ping Pong the Animation. 
At first glance, your first thought would probably be, ""A show about ping pong? How the hell could that possibly be interesting?"". This too was my first impression about Ping Pong and keep in mind, I'm not an avid fan of sports anime myself. However, after having seen
                  all 11 episodes, all I can say is that it completely blew away my expectations in all regards.
Ping Pong is simply what drives the story. What I loved about Ping Pong was that it was less about the game and more about growing up. We learn the hard truth about dreams, that not all dreams are meant to be. If you've read this far into the review you've probably noticed that I haven't explained exactly what the show is about at all. In my opinion, Ping Pong is a show best going into without knowing a damn thing. Life sucks at times, especially growing up, bad people aren't always bad people, they're simply people, sometimes no matter how hard you work, talent always prevails, these messages are what Ping Pong the Animation is all about. 
The only argument I see people make against ping pong being a masterpiece is that the ""animation is bad/ugly"", do not listen to these people. The art is simply different, the animation however, is fluid and well animated. Overlook the art style and I assure you that you'll be in for one hell of a ride. The story is simple yet executed amazingly and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard to date. The characters are unique and developed well throughout the show. I don't often give out 10's because I feel as though they are reserved for masterpieces, and in my humble opinion, Ping Pong the Animation was no less than that of that of a masterpiece. I highly advise you to watch this anime, you won't regret it.",10,omgitsbrandon

The sound effects in Ping Pong the Animation is really awesome. When I hear the racket hit the ball I think I'm inside the stadium hearing the ball bounce. But the best thing about this anime is the voice acting. Sometimes the anime likes to spice things up by mixing in some english. My favorite quote is ""No man so good, but another may be as good as

                After watching ping pong i said to myself ""Hey why don't i share my opinion about this"" and that's why i'm here. There will be spoilers ahead and i really recommend you watch it first before reading this review.
Story:
Ping Pong The Animation an anime about, you guessed it ping pong what a surprise. Actually you are half correct the show is about ping pong but its just a platform used to tell the stories of each character. Rather than focus on the two main characters, the show itself focuses on almost all characters mostly the ping pong players. As each character's story are told you
                  get more deep and strong connection to them whether they are trying to achieve something or trying to prove there worth to others.
Art:
At first the art of ping pong is not very appealing, But as soon as i watched the show i realized this that each of the art and character design were very fitting for each of them. Now this spark a great debate back then in 2014 whether animation is important or not, now in my opinion anime doesn't need to have a good animation or action scenes all they need is a story that people will understand and keep them listening. Take example of the Monogatari Series, Monogatari Series is Heavy Dialogue Based Story as most part of the show is just talking but once you gone through that barrier you will be immersed in the story and how the characters interact with each other and how they build the world of the story. As to what i'm saying with Ping Pong is that you don't need something appealing to be something good its basically like jotaro's stand Star Platinum from JOJO's Bizarre adventure looks ridiculous but is fucking bad-ass. Not everything has to look amazing in order to be called a masterpiece and that's what Ping Pong tells us. As the animation was all perfect for each character as each of it was basically describing their personality and emotions from character design to atmosphere. Here is my opinion, the animation is the outstanding thing I've seen in an anime sports ever.
Sound:
The soundtrack of the anime itself is basically outstanding from Bakudan Johnny's hype building opening to Merengue's soothing ending theme. All of the soundtrack weren't out of place at all mostly i'm gonna give credit the most is the Japanese children's song used at the final episode in peco and smile's match. Palm in the Sun this is the title of the song used in that scene and the way they used it is amazing as it show each character from just being a baby to elementary student playing ping pong, as this scene shows each character growing up playing the sports they known to love it shows each character's compassion to ping pong and how its not just a sports to them nor a game as its one of the things they've known to love. This scene also shows Smile's growth through out the entire show and his life as he learns to accept his emotions rather than to use it in a strategical way. this scene particularly is the greatest part of the anime and the soundtrack just made it 50% better having the greatest conclusion in anime not leaving the viewers unsatisfied.
Character:
Ping Pong has one of the most greatest character development, as each of the characters has different drives, different ambition as it show a great realistic look at the real world itself showing how far you would go to achieve your dreams and aspirations. There was not a single protagonist nor antagonist as each of the character's life is seen as we watch them grow and watch them win in ping pong. I personally have grown attached to all characters whether they win or lose as all characters learn something valuable in each of their lives whether its to learn to smile or to accept defeat.
Enjoyment:
Watching a game of Ping Pong could never be this entertaining as not just we learn how the game works but also we learn more things about characters and relate to them. Tatsunoko Production especially Director Yuasa, Masaaki did a fantastic job of representing the character's emotion and personality, each scene of the anime was neither bland or just out of place. After watching this i not just learn that Ping Pong is great sport but as how it is needed to be taken by some younger generations seriously as the seriousness of the players and how much pressure and training they do in their everyday lives.
Overall:
Ping Pong The Animation was an underrated anime due to its unappealing animation but as you watch the show you will learn how amazing the anime itself with its very relatable characters, amazing dialogue and just outstanding scenes of games of ping pong itself each of the characters are truly relatable whether you are an athlete of the sports itself or just a normal anime fan. I truly recommend this anime to those who are in to sports anime or looking for something different this anime is a total new experience for people who are looking for something different.

                Quick and easy:
Story - 10: Amazing. Ping Pong the Animation sets itself apart from other sports animes by not delving into the mechanics of the sport itself; you don't learn about the ancient Chinese penhold or the western-forehand-grip-with-two-pinkies-in-your-nose. Neither will you hear any jargon nor technical terms about the sport that the inexperienced would never hope to understand. The story is at its core about two boys' lives which only /happen/ to involve Ping Pong. They could just as easily be playing Basketball or Rock-Paper-Scissors and the story would remain intact and beautiful.
Art - 6: This is quite unfair to judge, since in a way,
                  it is drawn well, yet to some people, they'd just say it plain looks bad. I have to admit that the first episode was a huge turn-off for me simply because I wasn't used to the animation style. Remedy is simply sticking to it and then you'll come to appreciate the art style sooner or later. At least you know for sure it's not like cardboard cutouts with moving mouths.
Sound - 9: When a guy hits a ping pong ball, you damn well know he's hitting a ping pong ball. Beyond the sport, the karaoke and dialogue and voice work in general is very very good. I can't think of another show that does specific emotions like lethargy, insecurity, joy or ecstasy as well as this show.
Character - 10: These guys. This is the real hook. Halfway the through the show I was just like ""This is it"" because every single character you encounter is round and dynamic. You see that dude with the funky hair? His personality changes. That guy without hair? His personality changes. That dude without a name? Yep, he changes too. The show doesn't restrict itself to fleshing out the two main men in the story, but really makes great and welcome strides to developing the numerous characters that make appearances in these people's lives. I cannot stress how beautifully this was done. I'd give it a 20/10.
Enjoyment - 10: I just generally had a great time watching this series. You will leave each episode with a mix of anticipation and pleasant satisfaction, I assure you.
Overall - 10: This show has no shortcomings. None. Like, none at all.",10,Arelynn

                Ping Pong the Animation was directed by Masaaki Yuasa who worked on anime such as Space Dandy & The Tatami Galaxy. Those anime were praised by fans of his works. The reason being is that his work relies on imaginative drawings and how these drawings inspire creativity.
This anime was adapted based on the manga by Taiyo Matsumoto which became a successful hit in 1996 to 1997. This anime was like 8 years later in production. 
STORY (9):
The story revolves around Peco & Smile who were good friends since childhood. They became talented ping pong players.
The story actually took an interesting way of explaining how sports
                  isn't just about sports just like Haikyuu. Sports is all about determination and willpower. Just like in Ping Pong, the will to succeed is important than winning. As a player we go through ups and downs and emerge successful. 
ART (8):
The animation used imaginative colours to match the mood of a situation like purple represents melancholic or romantic, yellow means energy and vibrant, blue is calm and serenity, etc... However the colour that was rarely used was red, which represents from the blood stream. Just like Idolmaster, the colours of the idols represent their personalities.
The animation also used drawings like flashbacks just like ""Your Lie in April"" did. By showing flashbacks in emotions.
SOUND (7):
The opening ""Tada Hitori"" was like a rockband song. However, this song didn't dwell on me that much.
I also did like the OST although I wasn't very pumped up to the music.
The ending was nice.
CHARACTER (7):
Peco & Smile didn't impress me that much as characters although I did like their camaraderie. 
Butterfly Joe was named after a band name. However, Butterfly Joe is basically a coach who has an interesting personality with his silly behaviour however, sometimes he can be demanding and serious when it comes to matches. The OST for his theme does match the tone of a butterfly.
Manabu Sakuma AKA Demon has black uniform and the colour black which represents mystery especially self-control and having power. The colours actually represent the intimidating presence of Manabu Sakuma. Although I wasn't that intimidated by his presence. He was also quite interesting as a character.
The character Kong Wenge was in Chinese name. He is the most interesting character and if he has more material given to him then I would appreciate him more.
The rest of the characters didn't stand out in my opinion, although none of them ever showed me any annoying traits. I just wish they have more material to work with.
CONCLUSION (8):
Although this anime didn't surprise me that much and I have few problems with the show, I still enjoyed this anime regardless. I do not think this anime is amazing as most people think it is. However, I think this is a good anime about sports.
Sports isn't just about winning or losing, it is about the determination and skill. 
I would give this anime an 8 out of 10. I wouldn't say this is the best anime of 2014 but for what it's worth it is definitely an anime that is worth watching.",8,mercury1980

                I must preface with some information before delving into the review, full-force.  Pass over it if you are fine with God knowing you are a dunce (I'm joking, have a sense of humor):
As Masaaki Yuasa rises in popularity, especially in the Western world, Netflix series: Devilman Crybaby, it is important to ask if there is a reason backing his rise to fame.  I say yes.  Not necessarily for the quality of his content, but the consistency, or quantity of good content.  Ping Pong is only a milestone.  Yuasa has been able to create fandom that does not cling to only
                  one of his works, a fairly rare occurrence in the anime community.  I personally prefer Kaiba over his other productions, however many fans would debate that.  And that is the beauty of being a Yuasa fan, there is no definitive masterpiece.   
That said, Ping Pong is easily one of Yuasa's most confident works.  It has gorgeous, fluid animated art, not commonly found in anime, sadly.  And the script and character arc work beautifully in the self-contained story dealing with the human condition as it relates to friendship, alienation, and sportsmanship.  Like almost all of Yuasa's work, excluding Lu Over The Wall, existentialism is a common theme in his works.  Ping Pong is not the most thematically existential, yet it still has the classic Yuasa touch.  One of the biggest strengths in Ping Pong is characterization, because generating characters who come across as relatable is hard...especially for as skeptical a viewer as me.  In each character is a semblance of someone you know, and I respect the craftsmanship of it.  Art and animation in Ping Pong are epic, visceral, and overflow with style.  Imagination runs rampant in Ping Pong, and those who watch it find it an instant classic.  Although I would rather not compare them on any other plane than style and confidence, Ping Pong is clearly today's Cowboy Bebop.",10,SamuraiSteve

                Ping-pong the animation, I don't know where to begin. First of all, I always wanted to watch this anime because of the good rating, and I'm not a big fan of sports anime.  MAY CONTAIN VERY MINOR SPOILERS (but won't affect your watch) ^^
Something I have to mention is that I played ping-pong myself a couple of years, and everything they say in the anime about the sport isn't exaggerated and stays true to the sport (although it represented older styled TT), it made me want to to play again.
At first, the the pacing is a bit slow, but as the show goes on
                  you understand why, everything grows so well and connects so well, it's just so satisfying to watch. The story itself was very good (I enjoyed it a lot), I can't think of a way of how (with these settings) the story could have been better.
As you can see (if you have watched the trailer or see the art covers) the art itself is very unique, but I think that's what makes the anime better, I wouldn't change the art one bit, if you don't like it at first, but like good anime, it's worth the sacrifice. As for me, I really liked the art, it was really free-minded and paced, it grew on me as I continued to watch the series.
The sound itself is pretty good, you can hear very well the ping-pong shots, quality of sound and voices are also normal, ost is pretty decent, op and ed are very good, nothing really bad to say about it.
The characters are what made the most of the show for me (besides the fact that it was about ping-pong), you don't really get why they act like they do at first, but each character (for an 11 episode anime) have a lot of interesting end developed backstory that merges very well with the story. Even the side characters were interesting and added humour, I really liked every single character at the end of the series.
Overall I give 10/10 because of all these aspects and my personal attachment to Table tennis, I enjoyed a lot this series and would certainly re-watch! I highly recommend the anime if you like a slow paced but fully grown story (satisfying) and want to watch a good story.

                To be honest, I binged Ping Pong because it was only 11 episodes long. At first, I was a little put off by the animation, but I got used to it (like Akagi and the weird noses?). I wouldn't really call this a drama, as it's not that intense. Sports anime shows what each opponent is thinking, which makes me feel like I'm there too. It didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. There weren't cliff-hangers. But it was interesting and entertaining nonetheless. 
The thing I really liked about Ping Pong was the music composition. It's different, kind of like a techno beat
                  or an 80's synth track. It fits the animation, like at the dramatic parts and the animation style. The OP and END were also a good fit.
Character development was also good. The characters weren't overly complicated or 'damaged'. They didn't have intense resentment/bitterness had made them hateful. There weren't any players/opponents with flashy moves or superhuman strength (like some other sports anime) because ping pong itself is a really fast-paced game. By the end, they all sort of attain their own personal goals, even though the path was long and winded.
Ping Pong wasn't over complicated. It was simple, it was something different in terms of animation style, and it made something simple into something really interesting (I think that's more on the character development side). All in all, it was a good watch.",8,NerdSSs

                Ping Pong the animation gave me mixed signals in the first episode. I toughed it out through episode three and the show became great very quickly. The story in itself is amazing, but very basic: it's about conflict with one's self and this theme can be seen in EVERY character. The art is very very different, but after episode three you find it funny and enjoyable. Like I already said, the story is amazing, and you can't have an amazing story without amazing characters. Once the final credits roll, you kind of wish there was another season (or 20 episodes). I enjoyed this very much
                  and would recommend it to anyone.

(Story= 10/10 & Characters= 10/10)
Ping Pong the Animation is more than a sports anime, it's an anime about humans, their emotions, their psychological. It is common for sports anime to talk about effort and talent, but in Ping Pong he has developed it in a sensational way, the characters debate throughout the journey whether he is really doing the right thing, as in the case of Peko who must strive to be able to challenge the best opponents, but he doesn't
                  know if he wants it or not, he needs to look for a motivation to have the willpower to compete.
 In the case of Smile who has a rare talent, he wonders if he has to work so hard, if it's worth his time to devote his sport to his youth, and the coach helps him decide his path to being the best in school. He has other well-developed characters like Kazama who strives nonstop all the time, and wonders why he has no talent, he is tired of carrying the weight of being the best ping pong athlete, winning numerous titles and being a representative of the Japan
Kong is a character who seeks redemption, as well as being an obstacle to the development of Peko and Smile he goes through a journey to understand what humility is within the sport. Sanada is Peko's rival, he is extremely important in leveraging Peko's motivation, as well as questioning why dedicating himself to the sport with Kazama who is the hardest working on the job.
 All these character motivations during games comes up, you feel all the tension of the clash of ideologies developing in a totally organic and plausible way with excellent conclusions. The approach of the hero within the work was the one that touched me the most, Smile always believed that there was a hero for him inside his mess, as in the part that he was bullied and in the tense games of ping pong, Peko represented this hero, was The symbol of motivation for him. And later on we saw a new vision within the sport, that it is possible to have fun even if you try hard and sacrifice yourself in each match we can have fun and enjoy these moments.
 The way he presents ping pong is quite different, he does not present the rules, but when the first games of the game to understand naturally, beyond their techniques and character specialties, is not something that bothers or adds much value within the work.
 The ending of the work is fantastical, all the conclusions of the characters are interesting and well made according to their development, besides being totally exciting with certain scenes with a song that I will never forget.
(Art= 8/10 & Direction= 11/10)
All art is different and experimental, be it the scenery, character design, photography, etc. I got used to it, I don't think it was the best choice to make a very conceptual and contemplative art, but it was something well done and unique within a tight production of anime. The animation is more static than fluid, but all his Yuasa direction has created a dynamic inside game in a spectacular way, he knows how to edit and assemble the scenes perfectly to create a whole tension within the game, showing the characters' expressions well. , giving impact to each movement of the character's racket, as well as creating perfect symbolism for each character's ideology within their game vision. It's a fantasy thing.
(Ost = 1000000/10)
Ushio Kensuke is a great composer, has done great songs inside anime like Devilman Crybaby. Every soundtrack is well embedded within the work, can convey very well the tension of ping pong games, very impactful with great dubsteps, was sure to put electronic music inside the work. Each song for each character is impactful and memorable, especially that of Peko who represents the character very well and is more different from the others. The voice acting was great and the sound effects are very well done, especially in games.
(Overall= 10/10)
Ping Pong was a very important anime for me and is very important for the anime industry, especially sports. It can work its main characters in a spectacular and organic way as well as its important themes of motivation and effort, the art is good and unique, and its direction can bring dynamics between fantastic games, and with an excellent soundtrack behind it can immerse you inside the work in an absurd way. They always give a chance to all anime, I was prejudiced at first for having a weird art, but I ended up giving it a chance and it became one of my all time favorites.",10,Gianis

Who are the robots?
They are the human beings who've been suffering, their are three of em'. The only common thing about is the fact that all of em' are suffering from the disease. Loneliness. That's what has been haunting em'. The coldness of being at the top, they don't enjoy playing the game anymore they are doing it coz they don't have anyother choice. The hero is the one who helped them to enjoy the game again. The hero is the one who made all of their confusions go away. The heros is the one who defeated.

This a question that comes in my mind a lot of times and I used to be a lot confused with the answer. Who do you play for? What's the right answer? This show cleared it for me. I play for my team! Bruh, no way that's the correct answer... Well, if your answer is the same then lemme ask you another question, why do you play for your team or just tell me why do you play to begin with? Yes my friends the answer is really simple, you play coz you love doing so. There ain't no body in this whole damn world who can make you to love something until and unless you yourself do it. You, yourself have to do it and if you play because you love it then let me ask you again, who do you play for? The answer is really simple. You play for yourself, you play coz you love doing so.
What do you play for?
Do you play for just passing your time or do you want to make a livelihood out of it? Is it a hobby of yours or an undeniable desire? Well, let's simplify the question a little bit, do you play to win or do you play just for fun? Ping pong shows you both of the sides, it's not wrong to play it just for fun as long as you enjoy doing so and it's definitely not wrong to play to win or for glory as long as you're not forcing your self to do so. This is what Ping pong the animation tries to convey to their viewers and they did a commendable job in doing so.
What makes it worth watching?
Ping Pong the animation is a gem of sports anime. You might have watched a lot of sports anime that shows you the important of team work and hard work but this anime gives you what you truly need, even if you don't play, even if you don't enjoy sports all that much, this anime gives you something that you can use in your daily lives. It helps you to unsolved the questions who most of the people avoids or run away from, something that'd have come across almost everyone's mind but they avoided it like everyone else. The writer is extraordinary talented, he can make a story out of any thing and that we got to know from the impressive side stories that this anime provides as well as the past is nicely written. Once there were three prodigy, there era ended now all of em'are in some or the other way related to ping pong, these three trained three new prodigy and the situation is recreated. Also, the story of that guy who lost and quited Ping pong after losing to smile was also quite interesting.
The last episode almost made me cry and the ending was awesome. It showed the ways they choosed and how they ended up. Kazuma and the Chinese guy both of them made quite an impact on the show and there stories too were well written.  The anime is a 100% realistic one might even confuse it with a slice of life.
The writer did a good job in designing the character and connecting all of them to the main story in some or the other way. The opening and endings are awesome and suits the show just fine. The opening is energetic and is good far a start the visuals of the opening are actually nice there are some scenes from the anime but you won't be able to figure out much from em' so they're no spoilers whereas the ending is all thing and is my favorite. Both of them are already in my playlist so you can guess just how awesome they'd be. As far as it goes for ost, they suits the visuals, the music is the only aspect of the animation that I enjoyed. You are looking for a short anime series that provides you something more than just kicks? Ping pong the animation is the answer my friends. Can't study? Can't play? Can't draw anymore? You need something motivational? Ping pong the animation it is. Watch it and love it.",10,Krish_Phoenixx

                Finally, I had the opportunity to watch Ping Pong The Animation and I have to say some things about it.
I decided to watch it for all the critical acclaim it garnered and I ended up liking it more than I expected. To enjoy the show you have to get used to the 'weird' visual proposal and interpret the first episodes as a period of adaptation. Probably it isn't so difficult for you because it depends on each one, but I can assure to everyone it's a grower.
The story is simple, really simple, but it gets interesting because of the characters, its best feature. The ping
                  pong is used as a resource to introduce and develop the characters, but the sport doesnât get overlooked. Another good point is that emphasizes the value of friendship and the importance of having ambitions in life, in a good way. The pace of the story intensifies episode by episode, until to reach the masterpiece that is the last one. However, I think it could have been a little better if it had explored into other characters and the story can feel short and a bit rushed. Although it's understandable by the number of episodes.
The characters are almost all memorable and they develop naturally. To be honest, who caught my attention to continue watching the show was Hoshino, Yutaka 'Peco' with his carefree and bright personality. Later, you can be attracted by Kong, Wenge with his strong appreciation to his homeland and his mother or the coach Koizumi with his funny Japanglish. The list is long and I'm sure you will empathize with many of them.
The weakest point of the show is the visual proposal. It's unique, but that doesn't mean it's great. It has its moments, the color contrast is absorbent and most backgrounds are beautiful, but the character design and some scenes like Peco swimming at the beach can be irritating. The animation is fine. The good news is that the show is easily recognizable by its distinctive art and the risk they took is appreciated. The sound has high levels of quality and is fresh, suits the show. The voice actors did a great job too; Yousei did it phenomenal as Wenge.
In conclusion, Ping Pong The Animation may not be the most accessible anime to watch, but if you're a person that can highlight the good things of a show despite the difficulty to digest new proposals, I recommend you to give it a chance.",7,therandomviewer
22135,"
                By far my favorite anime of all time! This art for the animation is so abstract and different, that's what really enticed me about this anime when I first saw the art style. I'm also a fan of sports like ping ping, badminton, and hockey so this was a joy to see. The characters were greatly developed but I like how the main character makes you feel his emotions and inspire you, it's more than a show. ""The hero wins,"" I feel like Peco gave inspiration in everybody who watches this. It was also pretty amazing how they showed the trouble that the ping pong
                  players went through and how they got back. The soundtrack was exceptional, I listen to it in the shower!",10,Shitshitshitshit
22135,"
                I probaby would've given it a 9/10 if it didn't get so utterly predictable at the end, with the final two episodes covering the second Interhigh prelims tournament. The characters were really good and authentic, for the most part, but the way they decided to make Peco a literal God of table tennis was just so frustrating and cliche and lost any sense of realism, just turned it from an interesting story about competing at the highest level to any old superpower shounen. I rate Ping Pong the Animation a Dissapointing / 10. It seriously could've been one of my favorite shows of all time
                  if not for that so stupid ending.",6,koftli
22135,"
                Ping pong is the most unfortunately named sport in the world. You could argue football for the regional confusions (particularly the fact the US name doesn't even make sense), but the deal is sealed when you consider most westerners' perception of ping pong in popular culture is the sport's minor role in Forrest Gump. If sport popularity in America is ranked by how cool the sport makes the players look then ping pong must be close to the bottom. After all, it's just handicapped tennis for all the Forrest Gumps of the world, right?
Though Masaaki Yuasa's distinctly sharp character designs create limbs that look barely
                  more functional than Gump's, his adaptation of Taiyou Matsumoto's 90s manga breathes life into a sport that for many had none. If you laughed at ping pong before, then you certainly quit after watching Ping Pong: The Animation. It's no joke here - it's a matter of life and death. Or just a way to pass the time.
Such is the case for Makoto Tsukimoto. Tsukimoto is a freshman in high school but prefers to play the role of a ghost. Nicknamed ""Smile"" for his lack of emotive expressions and antisocial behavior, Tsukimoto attends his school's ping pong club with his only childhood friend Yutaka ""Peco"" Hoshino. Though their friendship is questionable at first when they're shown to have such diametric personalities, it's clear that the prodigious and extroverted goofball Hoshino and the silent analytical robot are two halves of this one sport. Though Tsukimoto attempts to underachieve, his disguised talent is recognized by coach Koizumi. As Koizumi is eager to instill a winning spirit in the dejected Tsukimoto, Hoshino will have to battle his own over-confident personality as well if he wants to reach his true potential.
Tsukimoto and Hoshino's skill garners the interest of several rival high school players such as the ace Chinese transfer student Kong Wenge, other ornery childhood friend Manabu ""Demon"" Sakuma, and the extreme cold-blooded high school national champion Ryuichi Kazama. 
An unusual sports anime that emphasizes strength of personality over refined skills, Ping Pong: TA dedicates significant time and attention to every character with a memorable face. Though the cast are ultimately competitive towards each other, they complete one another's weaknesses and pull each other out of their darkest pits. When a hero is needed, they always appear.
Though Ping Pong follows the basic sports anime formula of awakening one's potential through competition, and its characters fit the normal stereotypes, it breaks cliches by misleading which ones it's actually about. One such sports genre pitfall that's avoided is that by dividing focus between so many characters almost equally, the outcome of each match is never obvious beforehand due to narrative favoratism. The two protagonists will not win just because they're the main characters and that's convenient, and the personalities of many characters are the opposite of what they seem initially.
Masaaki Yuasa's direction is as distinct as always to the point where Ping Pong is his story just as much as it is Taiyou Matsumoto's. Making some changes to the manga's story turn out to be a good thing such as Yuasa's choice to modernize the original 90s setting and make it more relatable. Though Yuasa's usual simple yet geometrically complex illustration style stands out immediately his narrative direction has truly evolved, constantly evoking manga-esque cut-ins that elegantly shave off any padding that would come from standard scene transitions by allowing several different perspectives and scenes to be on the screen at once. This is particularly extremely effective during the action scenes where the ""panels"" jolt in with a speed and chaos that perfectly matches the force of the games. Many would like to cast off Yuasa's direction as a gimmick, but these cut-ins are as eye catching as they are narratively efficient and most, if not all, anime would benefit from the constant energy and skimming they provide. Yuasa's earlier mentioned inconsistent body shapes and perspectives emphasize the athletic feats of the players even further as if they were stretching their bodies beyond what is physically possible. When limbs are seen dramatically bending in just slightly impossible ways it's enough to make us feel the sheer effort behind their movement while it's not absurd enough to make us not admire the desperate humanity underneath them.
Kensuke Ushio is given the musical score and delivers a thumping, knee-bouncing, sweat glistening soundtrack of mainly electronic dance music. Ushio's teacher Aphex Twin may have not been able to make it any better than this. The synchronization of the soundtrack to the motions and personalities on screen is a contender for the best ever done in an anime, and during the matches it's so unintrusive to the point that there are moments where it seems as if the movements themselves are composing the music in-time, giving a weightless feel to all the force on display. Make every scene a lot darker with only white outlines and you have a bevy of top-dollar sports commercials. That the mellower moments still don't feel out of place with the general sound of the action scenes is an accomplishment in itself. It's no exaggeration to say that it's due to Yuasa's introspective direction that digs into the perspectives of the characters visually and Ushio's electrifying beats that make Ping Pong: The Animation as emotionally affecting as it is by aiming for the instinctual senses that all connect to the heart. Another example of the truth that style is indeed substance.
Contrary to sports anime aimed at a younger demographic, Ping Pong's competitive philosophy can be harsh and even cynical. The main theme of the series is what it means to have talent and what talent is worthy for. Certain characters express the opinion that talent or aptitude is the deciding factor in a competitive career and those who don't qualify need and should not apply. Again, ping pong is no joke here: this is an anime about the elite. It's a coming-of-age story that focuses on the demands of the much larger adult world than the optimistic youth environment. Though this attitude is the opposite of inspirational at first, the end philosophy reaches a respectable compromise that doesn't sacrifice integrity. The philosophy that not everyone has talent, but talent can come from anyone, and that the greatest talent in the world is worthless without freedom, and freedom is guaranteed to those without talent. This ties together the journey from childhood to adulthood, how heroes are made and why heroes need to exist no matter how mature you get.
Is Ping Pong the best sports anime ever made? It would win for the simple fact it makes a greater case for the idea of sports than any other. The idea of sports functioning as a sort of communication, brotherhood, and test against oneself is perhaps best displayed in a sport that's one-on-one and conducted in silence. For a sports anime, the numbers at the end of a game have never mattered less. Ping Pong is primarily a series of battles with the holes of one's personality, as reflected through the hundreds of tiny squares on a black net. The final victory is not trophies or pride, it's freedom.",9,FAKEANIMEGIRL

                Story - 9
Two childhood friends play pingpong.  I have no idea how to describe the masterpiece I just saw beyond that.  It's an emotional rollercoaster of a sports anime with all the necessary qualities of one (teachers, rivals, tournaments, etc).  It's a coming-of-age story about them and everyone around them.  Not the most original, but it doesn't have to be when it does it SO well.  
Art - 7
The art is phenomenal in its own way.  It's watching a parade of highschool sketches coupled with a distorted realism that you probably haven't seen elsewhere.  Characters are portrayed as
                  ugly, imperfect, and exaggerated.  The art is therefore very hit-or-miss, and mainstream viewers will likely be turned off by this.  
Sound - 8
Sound is for the most part excellent.  There are pump songs, melancholic songs, etc, and they are played mostly expertly.  One particular theme song annoyed me due to its simple and repetitive nature, but it fit the narrative so *shrug*.  Of note is the fact that the Mandarin (there is mandarin) is spot and if you can understand it, that's definitely a plus.  The Engrish on the other hand...more cringey and a little forced, though that could have been by design as well.  
Character - 10
Here's where the meat is.  The characters begin as established archetypes.  It is when they clash that the beauty of the show comes into play.  Characters meet, play, grow, and change.  I can honestly say there weren't any characters I was unsatisfied with by the end of the show.  
Enjoyment - 9
I watched this show in one sitting.  I opened it up expecting a sports anime where I'd feel pumped for the matches.  I left with little beads of wetness in my eyes as my favorite character suffered a defeat.  There were no cartoon villains here, only people.  
Overall - 10
I have no idea what they could have done to make the show better.  The choices were acceptable, dialogue wasn't cringey or forced.  It was just...great.",10,HatefulRandom

                On a sunday morning of which I hadn't awoken to due to my crippling addiction to video games and staying up far too late I decided to go out on a walk. While on said walk I noticed a decapitated man bickering with a fast food worker (Why a fast food worker would ever go outside is beyond me). The man who was decapitated who had no head because it had been separated from his body approached me and requested that I settle his argument with the fast food worker. I refused to decline so I approached the fast food worker and tore his head
                  off with my bare fucking hands. It was like pulling a lollipop that's been resting in the carpet for a couple of days out. but it smelled more like what your average respectable anime consumer smells like. I put his head on the decapitated man's body, turning him into a human being and, of course, saving the world. The now entire man told me to watch Ping Pong the Animation and it was really good I recommend it.",10,pingponglover

                Multilingual, non-spoiler review about Ping Pong, The Animation (English & EspaÃ±ol)
Is talent innate or can it grow over time?
I'll be honest, when I first saw the poster of Ping Pong, The Animation I chuckled with indifference and closed the tab on my browser. ""There is no way I'm going to like this, it looks ridiculous"". I put off watching this show for several weeks because I was judging a book by its cover, an old and overused adage that nonetheless perfectly explained my prejudiced notions.
Then one day I decided to take a leap of faith and give it a shot. As someone that would never
                  consider watching sport anime, I can only say one thing:
It blew my mind away...I was witnessing true art. I was immediately hooked. Why? My three main reasons:
1) Story & Character development: I never knew a plot based on ping pong could evoke so many emotions in me. I had watery eyes at the final episodes because of the sheer awesomeness of the journey the characters went through. This show is fundamentally about talent, commitment and above all else, knowing yourself. At 11 episodes, while it may seem short to develop anything remotely interesting or complex, is more than enough to deliver one of the best human dramas I've ever seen in a long time.
Every character has a purpose, and each one of them embark on their respective quests of self-discovery. They are all heroes on their own right, but even heroes have their limits. There is always someone better than you. No matter how hard you try or how talented you are, you will not beat this someone. When you reach that point, there is only one thing left for you to do: question yourself why you play in the first place.
2) Sound & Music: this show really knows how to pump you up! The music fits so well with what is going on onscreen, especially when the characters are playing. Saying that this is show has one of the best sound qualities and OST is not an overstatement. 
3) Art style: without a doubt the most controversial aspect about Ping Pong, The Animation. Is it Avant-garde? Innovative? Or plain ugly as hell? One thing we can all agree: it's unique and ballsy. It breaks the mold. The cinematography is top tier and masterfully directed. However, I cannot imagine this unorthodox art approach being used in a conventional anime as it doesn't lend itself for that sort of thing. 
This anime touches a subject that is dear to me: competitiveness. It is explored profoundly and through contrasting points of view. It made me question things about myself: Am I cocky? Am I actually good at what I do? Could I improve? Do I lack drive or am I at my limits already? As such, I found this anime very relatable and personal.
To really enjoy this anime you have to have an open mind. Watch Ping Pong, The Animation if:
-You are looking for something unique for a change.
-A mature sport drama with zero fan service sounds appealing to you.
You don't have to be a ping pong aficionado to enjoy this jewel. In my case, I love table tennis. Could this be one of the reasons that made me like this anime so much? I really don't think so.
Final score: 10/10 with a standing ovation. Ping Pong, The Animation caught me completely off guard: being surprised by the unknown is one of the best feelings there is. It makes you enjoy things again.

El talento, Â¿es algo con lo que se nace o se puede cultivar con el tiempo?
SerÃ© honesto, cuando vi el afiche de Ping Pong: The Animation por primera vez no dude en reir con indiferencia y procedi a cerrar la pestaÃ±a de mi buscador. ""No hay manera que me vaya a gustar, luce ridÃ­culo"". Pospuse ver este animÃ© por varias semanas, simple y llanamente porque estaba juzgando a un libro por su portada. Sin duda es un viejo adagio usado hasta el cancansio, pero que sin embargo explica perfectamente mis nociones prejuiciosas.
Entonces un dÃ­a decidÃ­ dar un salto de fe. JamÃ¡s considerarÃ­a ver un anime sobre deportes, pero despues de ver Ping Pong: The Animation, solo puedo decir una cosa:
Fue como una patada en las bolas: estaba en presencia de arte verdadero. Me enganchÃ³ de inmediato. Â¿Por quÃ©? Lo resumo en tres razones:
1) Trama & Protagonistas: nunca pense que una historia basada en el ping pong podrÃ­a suscitar tantas emociones en mi. En los capitulos finales se me aguaron los ojos por lo Ã©pico que fue el trayecto que tuvieron que recorrer los protagonistas. Este programa se trata fundamentalemente acerca del talento, la devociÃ³n y por sobre todas las cosas, conocerse a uno mismo. Con 11 capitulos uno podrÃ­a facilmente pensar que no basta para desarrollar una historia medianamente interesante o compleja. Por fortuna, fue mas que suficiente para entregarnos uno de los mejores dramas humanos que he visto en mucho tiempo.
Cada personaje tiene un proposito, y todos se embarcan en sus respectivas travesÃ­as de auto-descubrimiento. Todos son hÃ©roes por razones distintas, pero incluso los hÃ©roes tienen sus limites. Siempre hay alguien que es mejor que tu. No importa cuÃ¡n duro intentes o que tan talentoso seas, no podrÃ¡s vencer a este alguien. Es cuando alcanzas ese punto que sÃ³lo te queda una cosa por hacer: preguntarte por quÃ© jugabas en un principio.
2) Sonido & MÃºsica: este programa realmente sabe como animarte! La musica engaja perfectamente con lo que ocurre en la pantalla, especialmente cuando los personajes estan jugando. Decir que este anime tiene uno de los mejores efectos de sonido y banda sonora no es una exageraciÃ³n.
3) Estilo grÃ¡fico: sin dudas el aspecto mas controversial sobre Ping Pong: The Animation. Es Avant-garde? Inovativo? O simplemente feo con ganas? Algo en lo que todos podemos estar de acuerdo es en lo siguiente: es Ãºnico y osado. Rompe el molde. La cinematografia y la direccion son simplemente espectaculares. Sin embargo, no podrÃ­a imaginar este estilo grÃ¡fico siendo utilizado para animes mas convencionales, ya que no se presta para esas cosas. 
Este programa toca un punto muy personal para mi: la competitividad. Este tema es explorado profundamente y a traves de diferentes perspectivas. Me hizo cuestionar cosas sobre mi: soy presumido? soy bueno en lo que hago? podria mejorar? me falta empeÃ±o o ya lleguÃ© a mis limites? 
Para realmente disfrutar este anime tienes que tener la mente abierta. DeberÃ­as ver Ping Pong: The Animation si:
-Estas buscando algo Ãºnico para variar.
-Un drama adulto sobre deportes sin nada de fanservice te suena interesante.
No tienes que ser aficionado al ping pong para apreciar esta joya. En mi caso, me encanta el ping pong. Â¿Podria ser esta una de las razones por la que me gusto tanto este anime? La verdad, no lo creo.
Puntaje final: 10/10 con una ovaciÃ³n de fondo. Ping Pong, The Animation me agarrÃ³ completamente fuera de base: ser sorprendido por lo desconocido es uno de los mejores sentimientos que hay. Te hace disfrutar las cosas nuevamente.",10,Mordresh

                Despite it being only 11 episodes long, Ping Pong The Animation is a rare and outstanding gem that will definitely be engraved in your memory. 
An outstanding story revolving around the 5 main protagonists of the series (Peco, Smile, Kazuma, Kong and Sakama) and their struggle to persevere through hardships and setbacks in an effort to find and understand the deeper purpose of the dreams they are chasing after.
A story about understanding yourself and your talents, about changing, about moving on and giving it your all, about friendship, about confronting reality no matter how harsh it may be at times, especially when that reality reveals
                  your limitations. Defeats and setbacks, loss and grief, isolation and turmoil, anguish and despair, nihilism and ruin! These are the obstacles the 5 main characters will have to overcome in order to be able to accept themselves and keep walking, keep moving forward and reach their goals.
Unlike other sports anime, Ping Pong (the sport) is rather complimentary in this series and functions as a channel through which the stories and emotions of the characters flow. The music is outstanding and very memorable. The animation style is unique and fresh and matches extremely well the symbolic character of certain scenes. The characters are well thought and well developed despite the relative short length of the series. The story is well executed, it flows very well, there is cohesion and a very good pace, but above all, it is a realistic story.
Overall, an excellent, entertaining and very memorable series that you will definitely enjoy and will make you smile. Do not miss this one, it is a true gem!",10,Dr_Kon

                Ping Pong the Animation is a hard anime to sell.  Especially if you aren't into the sport of ping pong in the 1st place.  That being said, the first 3 to 4 episodes were incredibly boring because the main charachters were dragging the plot around. One, due to his lack of emotion and the other due to too much emotion. The first half is hard to enjoy 
The 2nd half of the anime is where it truly shines.  In the second half you can see some good, not great charachter development.  The story becomes more believable, the charachters true motivations come
                  to light, and it makes everything feel justified.  The second half of this series is easy to enjoy, makes you want to root for everyone, and pumps you up as a viewer.
I don't really have a comment about the art because it was consistent throughout.  That being said, I'll give the animation staff props for giving us as viewers a unique art style that really fits this anime better than any that it normally would.  So, props to that.
The music in this series is almost forgettable.  The OP and ED aren't memorable to me at all.  The one caveate that I have in regards to the music is the tune that keeps being hummed through out the series. I believe it was called ""The Heroes Song."" The Heroes song is a delightful, and simplistic piece that gives you as a viewer hope for better days, just like a hero would.  
All of that being said. If this series was 2 separate seasons I would have been able to give it a better rating.  The reason why I say that is because, the pacing threw me off on the entire series.  The first 4 or 5 episodes take place in the span of a year, but then next thing you know episodes 6-11 take place over the course of the 2nd year.  If the writers could have made the series a pair of 6 episode runs, I believe it would have been to the benefit of all the viewers.",5,skyhei1995

                It was so refreshing to see a sports story that does everything it can to not conform to common sports story tropes. Ping Pong The Animation was able to develop unique characters who all had their own interesting qualities and especially interesting motives.  One of the best way this anime thrived was showing the backstories of the characters in order to give the audience insight into how they got to where they are and why they play the way they do.  Even though it is only the second sports anime I have seen, I would find it hard to believe that I will
                  find another one that I like more.  It made me cheer for characters I liked, and still sympathize for the characters I didn't.  Because of that, no character seemed 2-dimensional.  
I LOVE how the story is able to see so many sides of competitive sports/activities.  It gives arguments for basically ever view and approach to the competitive scene.  I'm not going to pick apart each character, but as you watch it, keep that in mind.  Certain characters really do want to go all the way and become the best.  Others feel obligated to.  Others just play for fun, but they find their fun in getting really good.  Still others just try and try, but simply can't make it to that ""next level of play"".  All of this ultimately ties in to the ending of the show extremely well.
Now for the unavoidable conversation about the animation.  Some people say they hate it, and honestly I was a LITTLE intimidated going in.  However, the animation alone would have been able to keep me engaged, as it always had something pleasant and exciting to look at.  Sure some of the character designs were over-the-top and cartoonish, but hey... its a cartoon. Some of my favorite moments in this show were the split-screen shots.  It made everything that happened, even mundane conversation, become exciting somehow.  This show really is something to behold.
Overall, this show was absolutely amazing.  It starts in a place that gives the characters plenty of room to grow, and ends in a place that leaves you loving the main characters, understanding and sympathizing with the secondary characters, and wanted to freaking play some ping pong!  I am really finding it hard to say anything bad about this show.  for now, I'm not gonna give it a 10/10 because I feel like it was missing something that could really push it to be one of my favorite shows... however... there is a reason I completed this show in less than 24 hours.
Sentence:  This show is a freaking blast!",9,macdude95

                I am convinced that Ping Pong is one of the greatest works of modern storytelling ever written. It does more in terms of character development in 11 episodes than other series have done in hundreds. The two lead characters are so distinct and interesting, and I could not have expected the level of care that was put into writing these fictional characters.
The first time I watched Ping Pong I flat out didn't understand it. I wasn't able to allow myself to feel enthralled by the story, or the art style. I gave it another shot several years later, feeling a bit more open minded, and
                  I was completely taken aback by the care that went into every aspect of this story. Every character, even the somewhat minor supporting characters, is written so well. I was especially enthralled by the character of Kong Wenge, a character driven by pride, envy, and the overwhelming pressure to support his family, who by the end of the series is completely unrecognizable compare to his debut. 
Ping Pong is unique in that it's symbolism is primarily found in imagery rather than words. The ""Enter the Hero!"" piece that chimes throughout the series is perhaps my favorite imagery, and is nearly impossible for me to put into words. It reflects the complex relationship between Peco and Smile; Smile's lonely image of himself, Peco's confidence, and Peco's role as Smile's inspiration. Without spoiling anything, it charmingly challenged my preconceived notions of their relationship as I began to see the greater picture towards the middle of the series.
All I can say is that this series is fantastic. I'm glad I was born in a time where I could experience it.",10,mrmcbreakfast

But Who is your hero?
----I wrote this review right after watching it!
The anime was perfect. The story, the characters and especially the soundtrack is so beautiful and well done that I finished all of the series in one day. The character who doesn't really love ping pong but has talent, still won. Sometimes working hard is not enough to win. Interesting friendship and admiration, turns and twists, passions and dreams, homesick memories, everything is just there. You may not get use to the art at first but then you'll eventually love it just like me. You
                  should really watch it and enjoy the anime, not just looking at the art. Looking at the charaters and the story and you'll love it. I personally think that this is a masterpiece!--- watch the anime to figure it out who's your hero.",10,minnye

and how could it be another way, like most anime masterpieces, it is about everything but its scoop, using ping pong as an excuse to develop its characters in an exceptional way and giving them a very strong personality, and what to say about the direction, planes as strange and beautiful as Masaaki Yuasa has got us used to, as well as the perfect tempo in the scenes of the games for the characters that have those internal monologues in the middle of a game that both make me fall in love with This genre.

                    Here I am, in 2019, on a plane, bored, listening to Weezerâs blue album, and in the mood to write a pointless MAL review that no one will read because the show is old now.  But hey, I paid eight bucks for bad Southwest wifi, so I might as well get my money's worth, am I right?  And the lack of grandeur has never stopped me before, so yeah.  Ping Pong the Animation.
    This show is venerated as âthe sports show,â and I am a huge Yuasa Masaaki tard (I follow him and twitter and
                  watched him on The Tong and Pencil), so when I found myself bored at my parents house, I watched this jawn to see whatâs up.  And out of all of his works, this one was the last one I checked out.  Mainly because my dad plays ping pong, and the law of disappointing anime fan son says I have to dislike all sports my dad likes, so I donât like ping pong, tenis, and anything else that would make him proud of me. On top of that, I am not a big Taiyo Matsumoto fan, because I watched this show before I saw Tekkon Kinkreet and updated my opinon on him.  Regardless, I did watched this show and actually got stuff out of it--Imagine that.
    This show has a lot of selling points, from its surreal presentation to its narrativeâs many mixups.  But for me, the shows biggest selling point was the themes.  The idea of talent vs hard work is depicted harder than it is in most shows.  With the main character being a probably autistic boy who is gifted at ping pong and jaded towards it whilst people who love ping pong and train every day never win anything.  This unfairness is soul crushing to see unfold.  Being a low level Melee player that has yet to make it out of pools in a tournament, hearing the MC say that another person âjust isnât good at ping pongâ was so painful because I fear the thought of a jaded top melee player (leffen) say that to me.  The show also tackles the notion of untapped talent.  But since I donât have any talents, this theme was un empathizable.  Though that is a relative criticism, I really value  Pecoâs development and would even go so far as to call him âbest boy.â  if that even means anything.
    The story of this show is nothing to special in the grand scheme of things.  Relative to sports anime, it is the greatest piece of literature of all time.  But in juxtaposition to actual good writing, the story is just good.  At times, I found that having such a concept heavy narrative lead to many dry scenes.  The ideas the show brings forward is more than enough entertainment to justify finishing the show though.  It is just hard to care about a story when the MC doesnât even care--scenes of him training almost mean nothing due to this fact.  The final tournament arc of the show was a conclusion that made it all worth it in the end.   The show pulled out a great mixup at the end, containing enough catharsis to last until the next good sports show comes out.  Other than me Johning about some scenes being dry, the story was pretty nice.
    The artwork was what Iâd expect from a Taiyo Matsumoto work directed by Yuasa.  It was inane, fluid, and creative.  Something I do want to bring up is that Yuasaâs other works tend to have artistic style that serves a narrative point.  For example, Kaibe looks weird to show that even imagines as alien as Kaibaâs can still be humans with morals, feelings, and identities, which works perfectly with the themes of a psyberpunk.  So this begs the question, other than style, what is the point of Ping Pongâs art?  Honestly, I donât know.  This is a criticism I have of Kenji Nakamuraâs work since his art is just inane for the sake of being different without actually trying to be an artist and having meaning to what he is doing.  Though Ping Pong is not as gratuitous and pretentious as Kenjiâs work since the show is trying to replicate Taiyo Matsumotoâs style, which I find must more appealing then Kenjiâs.
    With all that being said, this anime is truly an âodyssey of conceptionâ (Infinite_fiend 2019).  It has, by far, the best presentation of the common sports anime themes.  I might even argue that this showâs themes are better than Rock Lee Versus Gaara.  But I digress, the story might leave some bored, the art might leave some bewildered or turned off, but I can safely say that the show won't leave you disappointed.",8,infinite_Fiend

                What makes us to move forward? What is it that we all seek in our lives? Happiness? Power? Fame? Stability? This larger than life anime somehow manages to discover all these fundemental concepts in life with finesse just in eleven episodes. 
Ironically, Ping Pong the Animation is not about table tennis. It is a personal journey rather than a straight-forward sports adventure. All the characters who happens to play ping pong have their own unique perspective in life. Every single one of them have their own reasons to play this game. However, they are still young and so full of themselves. Most of them think
                  they are superior over their peers. But throughout the show, they learn that the life doesn't go the way they think. Every character affects the others like a domino effect and they start to evaluate their own ideals and desires. At the end of their journey, they all find their own true motivations and become their own ""heroes"" as the show emphasises from beginning to end. And the self-realization of the characters happens the most organic and authentic way possible. Basically, this anime is the perfect encapsulation of the process of being an adult. 
I am aware that the art style is controversial but for me it is unique and distinctive. It stands on its own compared to other shows. Animations are fluid and sometimes very abstract but in a good way. Especially, I love the surreal visuals during the matches. They all were deliberately chosen to represent the unique mental state and personality of each characters. Tsukimoto as a robot, Hoshino as a colorful ""hero"", Kazama as a vicious dragon and so on. The symbolisms are just spot on for each character. 
The same goes for soundtrack too. It is versatile and fits the overall narrative as well. Particularly the upbeat techno music suits the back and forth dynamic nature of the table tennis. Ping pong is not just a test of physical endurance and reflexes, precise decision making and unpredictable tactics are also vital in order to stand against your opponent. While you're watching the match, you can feel the mental and physical battle between players to the fullest. And the mental battle is not just about the game itself, it is also the clash of ideals and principles of life. At the end of each match, both characters discover something new.  
At the end of the day, I know that this anime does not appeal everyone with its unconventional storytelling and art style but it offers so many things in just eleven episodes. I genuinely did not expect to be blown-away this much. Ping Pong the Animation is an ambitious and bold project without a doubt. It is a beacon of hope in this industry. Shows like this need more love and support from the community.",9,EpicSaxGuy
22135,"
                Ping Pong is not your typical sports show. 
Not just because the art style is extremely kinetic, sketchy and often metaphorical; emphasizing animation and emotion over drawing and painting. 
But because instead of the usual single hero who is destined to face stronger and stronger foes, learning their weaknesses, and defeating each one in sequence, you get something different. Something personal.
You get the story of not one character but many, each of their ping pong matches is a reflection on where they are in life, why they are alive, what drives them and what breaks them apart. And each match they focus on, does that
                  for both players at the table. Each player is playing for their own reasons, and each player wins or loses based on where they stand at that moment.
It's fascinating to watch, and the stories that develop, means that even when a character loses at a match, it doesn't mean they've lost at life. This sports show is about the players, the play is just its metaphor.",10,JohnIG

                I haven't seen everything yet. You think you have, but you'll never be able to officially say so until you watch an anime about...
Ping Pong
Yes, it's about ping pong! Your favorite sport to stereotype Asians around the world has become an anime! People who've watched this show will agree that it's a gem in storytelling. However, is that statement REALLY true? I decided to watch this show so you wouldn't have to in order to give my own opinions about its animation, soundtrack, characters, and supposedly-godly storytelling all mixed into the best gosh darn blog you've ever seen about a sport that's debatably not a
                  sport.
ANIMATION
Let's start by getting this topic out of the way. Now, what keeps a large amount of people from watching this show, like Aku no Hana, is a little something called rotoscoping. Now, I won't go into detail about what rotoscoping is here, but if you'd like to know more about it, here's a link to my review of Aku no Hana, where I go into great detail about the animating skill called rotoscope.
One aspect I found very creative on their part was animating different frames into a single frame. This makes the anime look very manga-esque. For those who don't know, the Ping Pong anime was adapted from a manga. Because of this, I believe that this aspect compliments the anime and gives the manga fans something to be happy about.
Also, though the characters look unnatural and are god-awful, the backgrounds and sceneries are done exceptionally well. 
For example, take a look at the ping pong house, which is a reoccurring setting in the anime, and how great the artwork looks.
6/10
Though the scenery is great and they were creative in their animation style, that doesn't stray from the fact that the animation of the characters resulted in a negative reaction from viewers. If your animation causes people to stray away from your show, you might have a problem.
SOUNDTRACK:
Ping Pong is more of a sports anime, so they can still accomplish what they came to do without the inclusion of a good soundtrack. Though the soundtrack is composed of over 60 individual music pieces, only about 2 of them are rememberable.  
8/10
I can respect the anime for being only 11 episodes, so they didn't have as much time as other anime to show off their music, which is why I gave them a higher score than I was originally. Though the soundtrack had some gems that were exceptional, I believe they could've done better.
CHARACTERS:
Now that you've learned a bit about the animation and soundtrack, les meet the people that make the anime what it is, the characters!
Sakuma Manabu (Devil)
Sakuma is a first year that attends Kaio Highschool and looks up to Ryu. When Ryu says that he wants members as strong as Smile, Sakuma becomes frustrated because he knows he could never become as talented as Smile. He then challenges Smile in order to prove his worth, but ends up losing. He then vents his anger by causing a fight with a passerby thug, resulting in him getting expelled from school.
After getting expelled, the anime doesn't cover him as much, but in the final tournament, he attends to tell Ryu something while accompanied with who we believe is his girlfriend.
Kong Wenge (China)
Kong Wenge, also known as China, is a very talented ping pong player from China. Due to specific reasons, he's sent to Japan and kicked off his team in China. Through the entire show, Kong's motivation is to prove himself in Japan in order to fly back to his homeland and his mother, who he cares for dearly. Like seriously, he's a major mommas boy. 
Out of all the characters in Ping Pong, Kong is my favorite. I thought he was a pretty average character, but after seeing how happy he was in episode 6, my opinion forever changed. Can you imagine suddenly being sent away from your family while still in high school?
Kazama Ryuuichi (The Dragon)
Ryu is basically the John Cena of this anime. He's everyone's favorite to win the Inter High and appears in commercials to advertise ping pong products. Attending Kaio highschool, Ryu only thinks of ping pong and how to improve himeself. That's right, in a final scene where Sakuma is talking with Ryu, Ryu confessed that he play ping pong for himself and not for his team. He puts himself under major practice and strain in order to win instead of having fun and eventually, he forgets about having fun at all.
What I find very aggravating about Ryu is that he has an extremely attractive girl that lives with him and has feelings for him. She invites him out during Christmas and even makes chocolate for him during Valentines Day (which was her birthday!) and IGNORED ALL OF IT! Towards the end, he's all like
""Idk what I did wrong, herp derp""
Ryu, are you freaking serious right now?
Tsukimoto Makoto/Smile (The Robot)
One of the two main characters in this anime, Smile is an extremely talented player, but at first he didn't show it. It took the massive pushing of his coach to unleash his true potential as a robotic player that identifies players in the first round to find their weaknesses and exploit them in order to win, hence being called ""the robot"".
He considered playing ping pong as a job and often let players win out of consideration for they're feelings. For example, when Smile was facing off against Kong, we was basically dominating Kong, until Kong's coach yelled at him to win or else he wouldn't be able to return to his home, in which Smile lost the game on purpose out of consideration for Kong.
Hoshino Yutaka/Peco (The Hero)
Peco is our other main character of the series. Towards the beginning, Peco doesn't attend practices because he believed he had natural talent and could beat anyone on the team (when Smile held back). This all changed when he challenges Kong and gets totally rekt. The idea that people may be stronger than him becomes present, but he only realizes this when Sakuma defeats him in the prelims of the Inter High and Smile technically beats Kong. Peco then stops going to school at all, gets a girlfriend, and even starts smoking.
It took a photo of him, Smile, and Sakuma as kids back at the ping pong house, seeing how much fun they had. This motivated Peco to do his own training with college students away from Smile and the others as he prepares to unleash the power of the hero.
9/10
Not much can be said about the characters except that they're all pretty unique and rememberable. However, they aren't masterpiece worthy, so the highest they'll get from me is a 9.
STORY:
And we reach the piece of resistance, the story behind Ping Pong the Animation. People hype this up as a very touching and beautiful story, but is that really true? In my opinion, the people hyping this story have all the rights to do so. The story behind this anime is absolutely amazing.
It begins with Smile's upperclassmen bullying and hassling him about the whereabouts of Peco, who was currently challenging people at the ping pong house in order to earn money. The coach questions who Smile is and recognizes that he isn't using his full potential.
The next day or so, Peco forces Smile to come with him to check out the new Chinese transfer student, Kong Wenge, play ping pong. As mentioned in the character section, Peco gets rekt. Kong then challenges Smile, but gets declined. It's when they return that Smile's coach decides to put him on individual training in order to prepare for the Inter High.
Once at the Inter High, they get pretty far in the tounament, but eventually lose. The rest of the anime is showcasing the characters and what they go through before the final tournament of the anime. It's during this time that the story especially shines. I personally thought after the Christmas scene in episode 6 was when they truly set the pace for their amazing story. In that episode, we learn about the sweet spot of Kong, the family curcumstances of Smile, an image of how low Peco has become in his drinking and smoking habits, and the dramatic love triangle that's occurring inside Kaio Highschool.
I've already spoiled a lot for you, so I won't go into detail about how incredible the last two episodes of this show were. I can say that in these episodes, we learn of Ryu's true nature, why Smile stopped smiling, the reasons why each player plays ping pong, and where they are after Highschool.
10/10
I came into this show knowing fully well why I was going to watch it; the story, and I wasn't disappointed. The story behind Ping Pong the Animation is a beautiful story discussing the relationships of people and how they can unite under one interest: ping pong.
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT:
By now, you've heard, or read, about what I like, dislike, and absolutely love about this anime, so I'll be brief with this section.
While I greatly enjoyed watching each character as they mature in a beautiful story around a party sport, there were some qualities that prevented it from becoming one of my favorite shows of all time.
8/10
There was a small amount of people that actually thought the animation technique was innovative and improved the anime. I for one, didn't. The animation is quite possibly the only reason why I didn't enjoy this show as much as I could've.

                If anything, Masaaki Yuasa is a great director, who knows how to make interesting anime that have a lot of ""meat"" to analyse.
I'll start by addressing the elephant in the room - the artstyle. Ping Pong, like Yuasa's other works, presents itself in a very unconventional, simplistic and blocky artstyle. The look and feel of Ping Pong the animation will be familiar territory for those who have watched anime such as Mononoke, but otherwise it may be a hurdle to get past in order to fully appreciate the good aspects of the show.
That implication was intentional. I didn't like the artstyle in Ping Pong the
                  animation, to put it bluntly. It is not just because it appears ""ugly"" on a superficial basis. I liked the look of Tatami Galaxy and Kaiba and both of those can also look rather ""unsightly"" at times, but Ping Pong feels like a technical downgrade from both of those, which shouldn't be happening because Yuasa's skills as a director and artist should be improving over time, not worsening.
On a technical standpoint the presentation in Ping Pong still works. The sound design of the sport, the music and the determined grunting of the characters is spot on at times, and there is some interesting splitscreen shot composition, along with characters that have suitably expressive faces and voices. 
The problem is that the unconventional artstyle does nothing for Ping Pong. The surreal artstyle worked for Kaiba because it was to convey a deceptively cutesy, dystopian cyberpunk world. The strong colour tones and ""cartoonish"" look of Tatami Galaxy was there to communicate the inherent silliness of the dramas and desires of college life. Ping Pong the animation from the setting and premise is basically a typical sports anime, and nothing about the artstyle inherently invokes ""sports"".
To summarise, Ping Pong the Animation could have been produced by Kyoto Animation, and have all the characters replaced with cute ""moe"" girls, despite this the result would have effectively been the same thing, and just as good.
Therefore, it is not the presentation that makes Ping Pong the Animation a diamond in the rough, but the characters. The characterisation and subsequently the way the events play out transforms an otherwise average sports premise into an emotionally-striking commentary on talent v.s hard work, passion v.s obligation, and coming of age themes. Each character is meticulously written to represent an aspect of these conflicts. Tsukimoto for example has no passion for ping pong but has an extreme degree of talent, his friend Hoshino on the other hand is extremely passionate about ping pong but has no talent. Each of the characters undergo development as developments in the sport and the passage of time ages them and even makes them question their life choices regarding playing ping pong as a sport. This makes the tournament arcs feel more authentic than in your standard sports or shonen anime, where characters tend not to develop and merely win or lose.
The other thing that works so well about Ping Pong the animation is that it acknowledges the fact that there are no good guys or bad guys in sports, just different players and perspectives, this is represented by the different playstyles and equipment of each school and even their nationality, without having to resort to sterotypes. Just trust me - you will be rooting for *everyone* towards the end.
Despite it's rough presentation, Ping Pong the Animation has a heart of gold, over time it has drawn many people away from the artstyle, but has enamoured others with it's authentic conflicts and characterisation. Although I seem to be in a middle ground in this regard I would still recommend Ping Pong for anyone looking for a change of pace in sports anime.",7,Lobinde

the cliche storyline, bad art, and some of fast paced (still somepeople likes fast pace) how comes this anime can get 8? let me tell you how it is.
the storyline is cliche as well as inspiring.

the art is as bad as child drawing. you can see the line isn't straight here and there, and the detail isn't near any good. but the movement was so smooth, for fast pacing battle (match) between ping pong players i can say it done well. the retro style makes you feel like watching a manga
character is a bit dull i think. not that dull but a lil bit dull. the main character done well. you can feel what character think, they grew up, they evolve, they expand. but in the end they are still same. i can't find a reason why i still feel they're same character after all. per se, the voice actor done well presenting the character
overall, i can say this anime worth 8. not more, and not less. it just 8. from my judgement the story, character and how the producer wraps the story is what you can enjoy from this anime. the art itself drags the point down. but, personally it's 5/7 (if you know what i mean) and worth to watch",8,jendster

                Tayoi Matsumoto has to be one of the best mangaka I've ever come across. Amazing storyteller. His style is super loose and I happen to enjoy that, it doesn't transfer into animation that well, but it's cool and doesn't deter from the viewing experience. This show itself is phenomenal. Well paced. I never thought I'd see ping pong as an 'on the edge of your seat' kind of thing but man they make it happen. The characters are incredibly well developed, especially considering how short the show is. They give you back story but it's never annoying or repetitive. As always with his works there
                  are next to no female characters. Though that irks me, his characters are so well balanced that I tend to forgive it. I 100% recommend this if you enjoy good writing/quality of story telling. I encourage you to check out his manga as well.",9,12sed

A fairly simple story that allows the anime to dive deep into each character in such short time, at the start of an episode you wonât know who a character is and by the end you discover their motives, reasons and dreams, and PPTA does it all without boring the viewer. As more and more characters are introduced and the plot thickens, PPTA doesnât slow down as every line and stroke has been placed so perfectly from start to finish, allowing Mr Yuasa to uncover the bigger themes of identity and success all within a 3 set matchâ¦ and youâd be quite surprised by how much a match can change a person.
Characters 10/10
The characters literally make PPTA, each one carries their own playstyle, attitude, background, goals with incredible depth. By describing each character like this it allows the viewer to understand who each character is and carry great empathy for each and every one of them. This is what makes PPTA so real, they are so relatable as we realise that we have the same struggles as them.
Art and Sound 10/10
Ping Pongâs art style is probably the most decisive feature of the entire anime, some people hate it and some people love it. If you couldnât tellâ¦ I am a huge fan of it. Mr Yuasaâs team have ripped pages out of the manga and animated them in such a chaotic way that it matches the sport perfectly. There are so many different ways to animate a match of ping pong, but none of them would be nearly as interesting to watch as the way it was animated, so I beg of you, donât drop this anime because it dares to be different.
For an 11 episode anime, Ping Pong packs over 1 hour of music that adds so much depth to an already rich anime. From the Ping Pong melody to the climactic Heroâs theme, PPTA knows how to take us through a match of ping pong as if we were playing the match. Payoff in film is commonly used to offer additional depth and meaning to a story that creates a more satisfying and complete viewing experience. Mr Yuasa and his team should be praised as music that is teased so early on in the anime shines like a star when finally put into the spotlight, leading to a feeling of sensation and realisation that Mr Yuasa has essentially re â defined cinematic payoff.
Final Remarks
âItâs nonsense to stake your life on table tennis.â
As I said at the beginning, Ping Pong the Animation strives to be something it shouldnât, that something is a metaphor for the journey that is life. People put their lives on the line just to prove to themselves that they are the best, all players are different, but they all want to win. PPTA doesnât ask the viewer if they would drop everything to be successful, it asks the viewer if what their fighting for is what they truly desire. This anime isnât life â changing, but it is thought provoking, a beautiful, heartfelt story that addresses the core desires of man and what it means to succeed. I seriously cannot use words to explain how spectacular this anime is, but numbers canâ¦ 10/10.",10,SirChino

                While the first four episodes start off extremely strongly, awkwardness in pacing and characterization that the show never fully recovers from leaves the otherwise solid climax with a feeling like much is missing. Ping Pong begins in such a way where it almost feels like watching a documentary but with greater intimacy. It combines a flavor of realism with dramatic sports manga tropes to create something incredibly exciting that densely characterizes the cast right under the viewer's nose.
Unfortunately, these strengths die out after the first 4 episodes, after which the show carries itself much more straightforwardly, and its weaknesses begin to show. Perhaps the biggest
                  weakness of Ping Pong is the way in which Kazama and Smile overlap too much in function. Both characters end up having a similar relationship with Peko, and as a result, the final episode feels like an inferior repeat of the climax that preceded it while simultaneously causing all the build up around Smile's character arc and backstory to fizzle out anti-climactically and weakly.
While Ping Pong had potential to be great, it ends up as simply a solid work that is undeserving of the hype surrounding it and is a great example of how superficial uniqueness and a seinen writing style encourages the general audience to overlook flaws and overrate.",6,Libido_Kamen
22135,"
                For what it lacks in the art department, it more than makes up for with it's energy. This energy is best described as great shot composition, snappy editing, eye catching colors, a tight narrative, and a great soundtrack.
There is no narrative fat, no filler, nothing is unnecessary to the overall story, the plotting is air-tight and everything that happens, matters. This show so skillfully packs in so much narrative into a short eleven episode series that most wannabe writers oughta watch this and take notes, hell, even the professional ones.
The main characters are great, they all have wants and goals, dreams, and a strong backstory.
                  Even some of the minor characters are fleshed out. You get to know so many characters that it becomes difficult to know who to route for. It also has a great long running gag in the form of one character trying to find himself (you'll know what I mean if you seen it.)
The direction is so kinetic, the use of split-screens take what is a janky animation style and make it livelier then some of the best animated shows I've seen. Not to say that I hated the animation, because I didn't. I see it as a stylistic choice, one that pushes the boundaries of what can be categorized as anime. Although at times the animation style did lend itself to some lazy images. 
Fuck if this wasn't a blast to watch. Mostly likely going to re-watch this one again soon as it was terrific. Don't let the animation style fool you, this thing is fantastic.",8,TravisBickle

                I was first introduced to this franchise through the 2002 live action film I saw at a free screening because I had nothing better to do that day. I was expecting the movie to be completely ridiculous due to the premise, but I freaking loved it. I have never had an interest in ping pong at all and I'm only passingly interested in sports movies. That didn't matter because the story and characters were so, so good. 
I wasn't sure what to expect from the anime, I had not read the manga the film was based on. I was very happy to find that I
                  liked the anime even more than I already liked the film. 
Story
The story is what makes the anime. I won't give a breakdown because others here have done a good job of it already, but suffice it to say that the story really hooks you and keeps you interested through the whole series. This isn't a sports anime in the vein of All Out or Haikyu, it has aspects of those but it is much more character and story driven than watching endless races/games/matches.
Art
The art will throw you at first, give it a chance and it will probably grow on you even before the end of the first episode. I was really surprised by the art style. Frankly I have come to expect anime art to be beautiful and precise, but the art style of Ping Pong is the opposite. It first appears a bit sloppy and jerky, but it ends up working so well that I'm surprised it hasn't been copied. It is unique in a good way.
Sound
The sound fits the action, it is as well done as everything else in this series.
Character
The characters are distinct, interesting, and compelling. Not just the main characters, the side ones too. Everyone is interesting and has something to do with the plot.
Enjoyment
The enjoyment was continuous from beginning to end. Some series start strong or end strong, this one is consistent all the way through. 
Overall  
Perfect 10. If you are on the fence about watching this, give it a try and I'm sure you will like it. It is different in a very refreshing and interesting way and it will be a break from the normal fare. Also, if you already like the manga or the anime you might give the live action film a try.",10,ps1917

                Do not be deceived by the lazy simplistic art style of this show, or it's topic: ping pong.
Hidden inside is a solid coming of age story driven by character development and suspense. The exposition can be slow and uninteresting at some points, but episodes feel short and leave you wanting to watch the next.
The ping pong side of the show is handled tactfully and isn't drawn out in any way. The music is very good at portraying the atmosphere in the show, and is one of the strong points of the show. 
But what I liked most about this show is the characters and their
                  interactions that changed my initial perceptions of them. For me, characters that stood out were 'Smile' and 'Kong'.",8,3amKitsune

                TL;DR: Sports show with a focus on character drama and growth. Complex characters, amazing direction, killer soundtrack, unique art-style, and a perfect run-time make this one of my favorite shows of all time. A must watch.
Ping Pong? An anime about Ping Pong, for real?
Yes, for real, and it may be my favorite anime of all time.
Ping Pong: The Animation is an adaption of a manga by TaiyÅ Matsumoto and is not your typical sports show. Character is king in Ping Pong, and all of them are well written and have complete character arcs. While the show follows many characters, the main protagonist is arguably âSmileâ,
                  the quiet compatriot of a braggadocios ping pong player. Both Smile and his friend cross paths with strong personalities from the Ping Pong circuit and have their current views on the sport altered for better or worse.
From there it is a story of development, but one I do not wish to spoil. Every single character, from villains to jokey gaga characters, are likable and grow as players and people. While most shows have some form of development for the characters, it is rare to see it done so well in almost every single one.
A big standout for the show is its art-style, which can take some time to grow on you. This sort of funky style is sort of a signature of the director, and he knows exactly how to make it work well. The action scenes are perforated with bombastic metaphysical visual metaphors and screen blocking, and the exposition scenes arenât lacking either. I canât imagine anyone else using this style so successfully, and the show would not be as good as it is without this personal flare.
The soundtrack is definitely another highlight for the show. Every track packs a punch, with the entire OST being a complete musical package. None of the songs feel generic or unmemorable, each one is packed with meaning and emotion. The character themes strike true for the writing, and their usage through the directing is flawless. Each leitmotif that is used has become iconic for the show. It also uses actual ping pong noises at times, which is fucking cool.
While an extension of the success of the direction an source material, the pacing in the show is nearly flawless. No scene goes on for too long, and no scene is cut short too early. Each character the show has to juggle for screen time never gets the short end of the stick. They all have the perfect amount of exposure and time to shine for their rules in the story. I normally have scenes and moments in shows where the pacing feels awkward, but I can honestly say Ping Pong has never evoked that feeling. While Iâm sure this wonât be the case for everyone who will watch the show, I still think its a notable feat.
Iâve watched an episode or two of the dub, and feel like it does a sufficient job of conveying the characters and story properly. I think the original voice actors do a much better job, but if you love dubs over subs, it shouldnât be a problem for this show.
I absolutely love Ping Pong: The Animation. Even if you are aghast at the art-style with its spindly lines and off-model angles, it is worth it to power through those opinions. Watch a few episodes, stomach through it, and you will get hooked and forget about all your complaints. Even if you canât get past the art-style, the rest of the complete package is well wroth your time.

                Ping Pong: The Animation appears (on its surface) to be like any other sports anime, apart from it's beautifully weird art style. I don't watch sports anime at all really, and did not expect to like this show as much as I did. I now consider it one of all time favorites, and a near perfect exploration of character development.
I'll be honest, the intricacies of the sport are not the shining stars here, but rather how and why the characters wish to master them (as it should be, in my opinion). What makes this show so heartfelt and resonant is how heavily it expands upon
                  its sympathetic cast, making their struggles feel like actual hardships that goes beyond petty rivalry.
Instead of one inhuman maniac playing against another inhuman maniac and the winner being the person that screams the loudest, each match in Ping Pong is carried by the tension between the characters' motivations. One problem that commonly arises in this and other action-y genres is the feeling that the story must constantly keep upping the ante. The techniques have to get crazier, the special moves have to get longer names, and the energy has to keep rising until it inevitably peaks and the story has nowhere else to go. While Ping Pong is occasionally susceptible to this, it avoids the bulk of this cliche by focusing on the characters' desires and backstories rather than the game itself. 
Instead of having every shot centered on where the ball is going next, it is centered on the faces and movements of the players. The observers and sometimes characters who aren't even present for the match contribute just as much to the rhythm as the players. Along with this, imagery that relates to each character's thoughts or motivation commonly enters the shot and evolves as the match progresses. Then, once the match begins to reach its climax, we learn more about the character's backstory or something that adds to their personality. It's a great way to keep the matches, which take up a lot of this series, from feeling one-note and repetitive. 
Ultimately though, Ping Pong is its most touching through the way it depicts defeat. The character's don't swear on their mother's grave that they'll come back twice as strong or anything pathetic like that. They are forced to face harsh realities that sometimes hit too close to home: thoughts of inferiority, debates about talent vs. experience, confusion about what exactly they're playing for, and even speculation that the sport has consumed them and made them lose sight of their own happiness. One side character gives up Ping Pong entirely and travels the world, yet even that fails to reinvigorate him. Only when he sees a very special match at the end of the series does he realize that there is beauty to the sport beyond self-satisfaction and discipline. 
Ping Pong manages to be incredibly upbeat and feel-good while also juggling a few melancholy truths of existence. Even antagonists like Kazama are given understandable reasons to crave victory, some that have tragic roots in the past, yet they are presented in such a way that they feel realistic and natural. Anyone that seems flat and unlikable eventually grows to be a complex and amiable figure. Every game played is a stepping stone for the characters to develop and find out more about themselves, leading to some of the most moving and bittersweet moments that I've seen in anime. Ping Pong believes that everyone can ""fly"" in their own way, and that's a  sentiment that rarely ever gets handled this well.

                I'm going to be frank with my Review of ""ping pong""...more like ding dong. This anime sucked big (bleep)!!! I did not enjoy ANY of the three episodes I was forced to watch earlier in my life (at the hand of my friend nonetheless, such an antagonistic fellow). The story is about as far from a realistic depiction of ping pong as you could probably get. Constantly for some artistic (autistic) flair, the characters joints and overall body structure will mend into jello to allow for some of the most ridiculous shots known to man, which destroys a coherent viewing experience for the intelligent.
And don't
                  even get me started on the story - its about PING PONG. NOBODY GIVES A FLIP!!!! WHERE ARE THE LASERS???? 2/10, no thank you :3",2,aquatictaco
22135,"
                Ping Pong The Animation is not the masterpiece most people claim to be. I have quite the opposite perspective, since I believe it doesn't even come close into being a masterpiece. 
Starting with the production quality, which is not very good at all, PPTA presents us with a unique artstyle, that might look stunning in more static scenes, but as soon as the animation turns more dynamic and exciting, the viewer is left with a mess that could be found at any low budget indie animation festival. The soundtrack is not buch better; a solid hype opening, but a completely terrible ending; a very artificial
                  soundtrack, which is mostly defined by a lot of passable tracks that are saved by a handful of better compositions like Butterfly Joe or Ping Pong Phase 1 and 2.
Despite its fragile foundation, PPTA presents us with a very interesting cast of characters, with a story set on Ping Pong utopia - don't let anyone convince you that this is the ""asian reality of Ping Pong"". This anime is barely about ping pong or reality. PPTA is mostly about people and their daily struggle to overcome their inner demons. The first 6 episodes or so are the better ones, but considering PPTA only has 11 episodes there are some of these episodes that are unremarkable and end up only pushing the same button that was already exposed from before. What's worst even, is that PPTA falls from it's glory and unexpectedly turns into the typical shounen/sports anime towards its second half. Everything becomes extremely predictable and the fun and intrigue from the first episodes fades away. 
Nonetheless, PPTA is filled with good morality and allows you to reflect through the point of view of many fully fleshed out characters, who are full of life. Some of them end up fading away or becoming useless in regards to the central point of the story - like Wenge or Egami - but these are all very interesting characters when inserted in the main dimension of PPTA. 
Personally, I didn't end up liking the whole ""hero"" ordeal - it's just a way of glorifying the boring and overrecycled tropes of every anime ever. Why must it be so important to find a hero? Why is it more valid than to fight against your pain and struggle? Why is it more important than to overcome your lack of natural talent? At some moments I felt like there was an urge to shove Peco down our throats, even though most of the other characters had motives as strong as Peco's. I believe PPTA would have been much better with a little bit more openness regarding the several ideals exposed. This is especially true, as people don't seem to able to understand PPTA to the fullest - this is a major flaw from the anime, as it always undermines many of its more meaningful messages to feed the main idea of heroes, talent and hardwork. There is not enough conviction in showing that people can become the best version of themselves at any given point and space if the time and the context is appropriate. In a non-utopic world you can climb by the top through several means. Hard work is the primary one. Hard work is not about running 10 km everyday. Your progress will become stale if you don't know where to improve. Recognising your weaknesses and where you can improve is fundamental to success. In a real context, your opposition won't be looking at you head-to-head like in PPTA. You can always find a way to climb to the top without relying too much on your talent. Look at all the musicians from nowadays. Look at all the pro athletes. On a given context, you can be very successful even if you are #100, even if you are #1000, even if you are #10000. You'll be set for life you work hard enough with the tools you are given. That is reality. What is also reality is that hardworking means that you are working and making an effort that is clearly above average. For me this is the biggest lesson that you can take away from Smile and Peco. A character like Sakuma would probably reach some level of success in reality, but sometimes it is true that you need to realise that there is a clearer path to success.
PPTA was a fun ride and a good anime about self-growth, overcoming yourself and finding success within your context, but its flaws and limitations are not be overlooked. There have been many movies, books, series and anime telling us this story, some of them in a more meaningful fashion, but PPTA strong suit is its characters and uniqueness. If you look past that you'll clearly see that there was more to be achieved.

                Ping Pong the Animation takes no prisoners.
With director Masaaki Yuasa at the helm, heâs able to transform a âseemingly lameâ sports drama into one of the greatest anime of all time. I say âseemingly lameâ, because here in North America, we see it as more of a friendly sport rather than something truly serious.
Ping Pong the Animation is about two high-schoolers with a monstrous talent for Ping Pong. It describes an athleteâs journey to the very top, the best of the best, the one percent of the one percent. Even though itâs primarily about Ping Pong, its messages can be applicable to real life in
                  regard to chasing your passions. Itâs for this reason alone that I think that Ping Pong the Animation is, without a doubt, a masterpiece.
You donât need to be a connoisseur of art to understand just how rich the show is. You donât need to be a sports athlete to relate to the characters. All you need is a pinch of curiosity to explore the unfamiliar. 
Conversely, as outlined by multiple reviews, you can find it pretty easy to dislike this show. The art style for instance, is an easy point of contention. From the beginning to the OP, Ping Pong the Animation SCREAMS that itâs not like any other anime youâve ever seen. Its obtuse art style may deter those who were expecting large anime eyes and XXL bonkhonagahoogs of the anime tid. The story too can be seen as a bundle of cliques because it doesnât seem to do anything unique. They have tournament arcsâ¦ They play Ping Pong seriouslyâ¦ Iâm just going be frank with you, I donât watch sports anime so I canât relate to this critique at all lol
Letâs first talk about the art style. Itâs rough, unorthodox, blended 2D and 3D, and overall, kind of UGLY. But as you watch through the series, thereâs this inexplicable charm that exudes from it. As the show progresses it enthralls you with a lot of soul. The one aspect that might throw people off is just how mutable the art style is.
The OP and later episodes demonstrate this. Hell, even the posters for this show is vastly different than what the show actually presents. The later episodes have moments where they swap to a more cartoon-y and 3D style, blending in just as well as how Space Jam does it. As the colors arenât shaded, they allow for the 3D to flourish just enough to slow the pacing a little.
Of course, this isnât perfect. This anime came out in 2014 and the 3D is still easily distinguishable from the 2D, and thatâs a good thing. Because it shows that the presentation and execution was done immensely well. You wouldnât need to criticize the 3D moments because their impact is so minimal on the overall enjoyment.
There is also another egregious flaw in this diamond in the rough ala reusing footage. Yeah, Iâm not going to sugar coat this one. They reuse animation clips, even going so far to repeat said clip twice with only one shot in between. This can also be used as ammunition to deter it from being a masterpiece, but I donât believe that this is a fatalistic flaw. These repeated clips are only used for style points and still convey what they want to convey. I will admit, it is a bit tiresome to watch the same flashback with the same clip that just has a different filter on it. I canât defend it, but I also donât care about the flaw since it still fits in the show just fine. Even though I felt like I yearned for more Ping Pong action, I was never mad when they repeated the same flashback ad nauseum just to remind you that each player has their own personal stake in the match. 
And thatâs because when Ping Pong the Animation shines, it truly shines bright. Like a supernova, anyone who watches will be dazzled, seduced, awestruck. Those who miss it because they had a long day at their 9-to-5 job will be confused or depressed as they miss out on such an ephemeral yet visceral event. Thankfully, said event can be archived, much like how we can still watch a 7-year-old anime (at the time of writing) on the interwebs.
Letâs talk about the presentation. It is a complete upgrade from the manga, faithfully adapted with everything and then some. With overhauled visuals that look fittingly modern, Masaaki Yuasaâs masterful story telling is employed to full effect here. He translates each panel masterfully, and even adjusts the story to better suit the medium. On top of that, each element of the show has so much soul infused into it. From the story down to the subtitle translations (or even the dub for that matter), every moment feels like true art because there was so much care put into it.
Like Marcel Duchampâs Fountain, a literal urinal that managed to change how contemporary critics and intellectuals view art (in other words, paving the way to how people view modern art today), Ping Pong the Animation invites us to accept its challenge, straight from the blu-ray cover. The cover looks strikingly intriguing because itâs clean, drawn in a classical anime way to emphasize everything thatâs important in that single frame. In this case, itâs the characters. Iâll briefly go over the characters later. For now, let me explain why Ping Pong the Animation absolutely obliterates the three-episode rule.
Ping Pong the Animation begins its ruthless massacre from episode 1. Shattering a personâs ego is as close as you can get to killing important main characters in any media, and Ping Pong the Animation does it without even blinking. Itâs a story about chasing your passions and climbing to the top becauseâ¦
âThere are some sights you can only see at the top.â â Koizumi, ep2, Blu-Ray translation.
Nobody cares that you were a top-tier athlete for your local high-school unless you were talented enough to be world-class. Only then would you have the world witnessing how powerful your existence is, basking in whatever glory you can bring. To stand at the apex of your passion showcases PURE ascension beyond the enthusiast tier. To stand as a king, a master of your subject allows you to look down on your cute plebian kouhais as they squirm around practicing a move you learned and mastered in mere minutes. Beyond the 98th percentile lies the 99th and 100th percentile. Beyond the S-tier lies the SS-tier and SSS-tier.
Ping Pong the Animation is as meta as any A-tier (and above) sports anime, with my closest comparison being Whistle! or Touhai Densetsu Akagi. It exemplifies and fuses every element needed to become a world-class athlete. In other words, Ping Pong the Animation needs to prove that itâs the real deal, and it does that by building itself up to the first tournament arc in the third episode. As stated earlier, Ping Pong the Animation begins its merciless assault from the get-go. It doesnât seem like anything interesting happens until the very end where two characters duel it out in a âfriendlyâ match. This is where the duelist nature of the sport truly shines, as itâs this vicious energy that drives each character to win and obliterate their opponent. And itâs only after this first duel that you know that you want to see more. Episode 2 follows the same structure, the same song and beat. Youâre left HUNGRY for action, craving the destruction of egotistical bastards who think theyâre the shit. Then for the third episode, Ping Pong the Animation doesnât blue-ball the viewer. It capitalizes on their anticipation by jumping straight into a tournament arc. Even though the characters arenât quite as fleshed out as they can be, the results speak for themselves. 
Character growth is Ping Pong the Animationâs strongest and most legendary strength. It transcends the original adaptation, making the original manga look poor and weak in comparison. I wonât bore you with the differences here, though. 
Enter the heroes, Smile and Peco. Smile enjoys playing Ping Pong on a casual level, but stifles his own talent when breaking a sweat is more of an annoying chore. Peco can only be described as a cocky son of a bitch who thinks heâs the shit. Itâs the journey of these two characters with an unparalleled talent that showcases what honest and true passion looks like. You WANT to keep an eye on these characters because they CAN speak with their skills. When other characters recognize their innate talent, you can recognize them as a force of nature that can and will destroy peopleâs dreams.
This bloodthirst isnât exclusive to these characters, it extends to everyone. Each character in Ping Pong the Animation has a purpose, from the no-name grunts all the way to Kazuma âthe Dragonâ. They show you how they see Ping Pong. There are plenty of ways to appreciate a sport, but I think my favourite has to beâ¦
âSights where competition isnât a factor,â Sakuma, ep. 6, Blu-ray Translation.
By the end of the anime, I was a sucker for nearly every single character. Each character had grown up or shown a powerful level of maturity and depth to them. As the world continues to spin another day, these characters move on from their ruined egos.  This is where Masaaki Yuasaâs touch comes in, as each character has their own stylish theme, memorable appearances (minus Kaio high, their eyebrows are their personalities), and captivating story. To name a difference, the manga doesnât elaborate on Kaio High nor Kazama at all. Itâs exactly that focus on interpersonal relationships that proves just how strong each character is. Every single one of them are out there for blood, but only one can stand at the very top.
Even if it comes at the cost of sacrificing the potential of the story (if there was any, because the story is pretty clear-cut), I believe this is a fair trade. Watching these characters passionately crush each otherâs dreams brings along this tension that you would only know of if you were slightly competitive in nature. This means that if you donât give a shit about the characters, watching Ping Pong the Animation might be a complete slog for you. Because if you care about the technicalities and formalities, Ping Pong the Animation doesnât provide much. It has flashy matches, but the full games arenât shown. Players inspect each otherâs racket and youâre told about each playerâs playstyle through subtitles, but thatâs it. They show moments of Ping Pong theory, but only enough for you to grasp the killing intent. Behind the scenes, there truly is a wealth of depth that isnât explored, but thatâs fine. Itâs moreso about the characters than the theory, the melodrama rather than the actual game itself.
The soundtrack â holy fuck bro. Itâs world-class, or at the very least, one of the most memorable anime soundtracks. When it comes to soundtracks, I mainly listen for emotional appeal, since my brain has a deficiency in braincells and canât really grasp onto lyrics with whatever meaning they might have. After all, I sometimes daily drive anime OPs and have no idea what theyâre saying until I feel like looking up a translation.
I can describe the entire soundtrack with a single word â passion. Canât you feel it too? From the casual theme of the Katase High School Ping Pong Club to the existential crisis that is the Melancholy of the Dragon, each track is filled with this inexplicable passion that somehow only fits in Ping Pong the Animation. Yes, you can insert this theme wherever you want, but the roots are undeniably clear. Chinaâs theme belongs only to an egotistical bastard named China. Butterfly Joeâs theme belongs only to a seasoned veteran who has seen everything the sport has to offer, beginning with a beautiful melody akin to sniffing sunflowers and transitions into a ferocious intensity of a boss theme. Of course, not every song is a masterpiece, but itâs worth noting that even the off songs still set the tone well enough to not be placed under intense scrutiny. Nobody cares that you can find 25 flaws within the Christmas jingle.
Enter the hero, enter the hero, enter the hero.
Upon saying this phrase, the hero from Planet Ping Pong swoops in and saves the day. To me, Ping Pong the Animation is sheer inspiration. In an ever-growing world filled with unique and unforgettable experiences, Ping Pong the Animation still stands at the apex. It is, dare I say it, objectively good.
Objectively, Ping Pong the Animation has no flaws, only blemishes. Iâve watched this show at least 5 times now. Each time, Iâve watched and enjoyed it all the same. I havenât completely rewatched the show in dub, but the only flaw with the dub would be Kong Wengeâs voice. Iâve read the source material, and have found that the anime adaptation is so much more impactful, leaner, and transformative. If youâre able to spot a true flaw that can leave a stinky impression every time I revisit the show, please let me know. Otherwise, whether the blemishes affect your viewing experience is entirely up to you.
I honestly canât trust anyone who rates this show a 4 and below. A rating of 4 would imply that they dislike Ping Pong in general. I can understand if they watched Ping Pong the Animation just to watch it, but to find the anime insulting is an entirely different thought process. I can understand brushing off this show as mediocre if they werenât able to resonate with it. But saying that this show is terrible simply because itâs unable to match whatever standard they uphold as the very best can only showcase how they canât place a limit on their own expectations. Such expectations are still fair, but it would be like trying to compare Ping Pong the Animation to Gintama, Ghost in the Shell, the newly released Arcane or even Squid Game (if you like C-tier nonsense). Following this train of thought would only lead to more and more needless subjectivity.
Ping Pong the Animation doesnât care about your opinion because the show is having fun with itself. With its diverse art styles, invigorating story, and legendary characters, itâs clear that this is one of Masaaki Yuasaâs true masterpieces. Being able to transform something that took place in the 90s to something in the mid-2010s is certainly no easy feat. Iâm not sure if I can call this an easy watch as I can easily rewatch this show for many times to come. But I can say that there is only one barrier that might prevent you from watching the show in its entirety â the obtuse art style. If you canât even overcome that single barrier, then itâs not me gatekeeping the show, itâs yourself.
To simply refuse to watch Ping Pong the Animation because of its obtusity exposes just how conceited of an anime viewer you are. Itâs exactly like judging a book by its cover and refusing to touch it with a 10-foot pole. And itâs okay if you feel insulted by my statement because this wasnât directed towards you, but rather one of my best friends (you know who you fucking are, you bastard) who refuses to watch the show simply because of the art style. To feast on pointless seasonals instead of exploring the medium with your capable eyes is honestly a damn shame. On the otherhand, if youâre going to continue to be a connoisseur of seasonals, thatâs perfectly fine. Just donât come at me pretending to be a hot-shot snob (which thankfully, they donât). Because praising a seasonal show as a masterpiece when it really isnât only shows how incapable you are of being able to grasp the bigger picture. Can you really call yourself an âanime criticâ when you canât even explore the unfamiliar and default to the safe-space that is delectable seasonal trash? The answer is no.
Ping Pong the Animation can be the revelation you were looking for all your life or it can be one of the most mundane sports show youâll see. To have watched the show already places you on a level higher than the average viewer because itâs definitive proof you have the capability to explore the objective unfamiliar. Ping Pong the Animation might not be for everyone, but everyone - at the very least - should give Ping Pong the Animation a chance.

                I have just finished watching it for the third time. I mean, no big deal, just eleven episodes, roughly 20 minutes each. I started yesterday, I wanted to show it to my nephews and my daughter. We've managed to watch two episodes, they were not completely bought in. Once they left, I just continued watching, shaking my head after each episode. It's unbelievable how you could create something so good.
Even though the title says Ping Pong, it doesn't really matter what would it be. The questions that the anime asks are of the nature of challenge, the nature of talent, is it possible to have
                  a talent that you don't want, is it possible to want a talent and don't have it, is it possible to overcome the lack of talent. It is refreshing to see a Japanese manga author take the topic so seriously, so realistically, with such care.
It's a really deep psychological series. All of the possible outcomes are shown all at once through the lens of varied characters. Smile, Peco, Dragon, Akuma, Wenge and a strong cast of supporting characters, each with their own stories, each with their own motivations, each with their own hardships.
The way I recommend watching it is to focus on character motivations. That really is something that drove me into this. Seeing real people in real life situations, with that - sort of - larger than life problems that are associated with coming of age stories.
The artwork is special, it's something entirely different from what the regular anime viewers are used to, but it is beautiful, clever and just suits the story perfectly.
The dialogues are excellent, the story impeccable.
I guess a disclaimer is in order. I used to train sports when I was younger and I love most of the sport animes, even though you know perfectly well what is going to happen (we play a game, we lose, we train, we overcome, we come against stronger opponent, probably overcome them pulling a rabbit from the hat [or if the anime / manga is really good we lose again] and the cycle continues). Therefore I was able to identify with all of the characters, I can understand them. Not sure how it translates for people who have never played a sport on a semi-pro level.
Regardless, you can watch it all in just below 4h and that is a treat. Just try to understand, the action here is the tension between characters and their goals. Between what is limiting them and their struggle to see the view up top.",10,Vinnietou

                *This review may contain spoilers*
So this is more or less the story of two friends who play pingpong. There are a number of side characters from China -- a david bowie looking guy who's homesick, a snakelike dude (maybe he was japanese, he was their childhood friend or something), and some skinhead who's really good and appears to be in a relationship with his cousin.
Given the nature of the the game pingpong, the show addresses the inevitable agon with melodrama by embracing it and resigning itself to having relatively unstable degrees of sincerity, which is all well and good. This allows for some indulgent scenes
                  with split screens, fantasy sequences, and extended psychological reflections; Of course, most of this is done in relationship to pingpong games.
The two protagonists seem to be rather stereotypical anime characters -- the reflective, unemotional and stoic Smile, and his overemotional friend Peco. Smile is more epicurean, ironically, in his pursuit of pingpong, and Peco is more honor and competetition driven. Over the course of the show they end up coming to amend some of the problems that arise from their radical personas, and learn to be more like the other.
The most notable thing about the show might have to be the art. It is mostly a bland color palette, a strange animation style that nearly verges on being 3d animation, and creative tangents in which color, animations tyle, and realism is vastly stretched into creative but smoothly implemented episodes. On the other hand, the people look very ugly and sometimes the animation isn't as satisfying as it could be, depicting the action less directly than it should. Nevertheless the animation is at least interesting.
Mostly a quiet little anime that you don't need to take all that seriously, with action that embraces its melodrama.",7,hurleyjacoba

                Story & Writing: 10/10
Watching Ping Pong The Animation is like being pegged by an Amsterdam prostitute while role-playing as a conservative MP in denial. It's an extremely unorthodox and bizarre experience, but you can't help but be enthralled, enchanted, mesmerized, and hypnotized by it. You keep coming back for more, unable to resist its beckons. You are glued to the screen; fixed to your chair by a strange energy that emanates from every frame of animation, from every sound effect, every music note. From the follicles of your hair to the soles of your feet you are filled with a strange emotion. It wells up
                  within you, bleeds into your senses, and oozes out of your eyeballs. You cry not because you are sad, but you realize that Ping Pong The Animation is not actually an anime about ping pong at all.  It is a parable; an anecdote about life.It chronicles the era of youthful self-discovery and exuberance that sleeps inside us all.  Some might even call it a ""perfect coming-of-age story,"" and while that is quite a fitting term to describe the true nature of this beautiful show, it does not even begin to encapsulate its artistic merit. I realize that I've literally said nothing concrete about the story, characters, or writing, but that's intentional. Go witness firsthand how relentlessly human and likeable these wonderful representations of real people are. Hero Kenzan. Hero Kenzan. Hero Kenzan.
Art: 10/10
Some might say that art is subjective, and while those very same people may call Ping Pong The Animation's artstyle ""ugly,"" those people are objectively wrong. These are phillistines who understand nothing about artistic integrity and expression. Ping Pong's unorthodox artstyle doesn't make it look bad; it's the opposite. Each frame of animation is dynamic and expressive unlike any other. The characters break model quite often and quite liberally. This allows for some of the most interesting camera angles, screenplay, and directing I've seen in a while. The camerawork and choreography during the ping pong matches are nothing short of superb. It takes no small amount of skill and effort to make PING PONG, of all things, look absolutely exhilarating and breathtaking. 
Sound: 10/10
The soundtrack is one of the best things about this series.  Every single track fits amazingly well and kicks emotional highs into maximum overdrive. The ED is the single best track in all of the OST. Merengue is basically Japanese Owl City, and their song perfectly captures the energy and emotional core of this show. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
It's been quite while since I was this completely enthralled by an anime series. Most shows don't excite me as much as they used to anymore, but Ping Pong managed to turn me into a beginner anime viewer all over again, glued to my seat, completely immersed and impressed by everything. Anime is not dead.
Overall: 10/10 masterpiece",10,SuccHunter

                Ping Pong The Animation on paper looks like a standard sports anime centered around the themes exploring rivalry, friendship, dreams, failure, success and hard work presented through long matches and overstretched tournaments. To a certain extent it is exactly that sans the long matches and longer tournament albeit at this stage is where the anime draws a line of differentiation as opposed to its contemporaries. 
If you approach Ping Pong as a sports anime you would never enjoy the anime. It is not about Ping Pong but rather about two students who play the game and the people they cross paths with. There isn't a
                  linear and set story line in the anime which would dictate the paths and goals the plot must take, rather, it is a character study of two boys namely Peko and Smile. Both the MC's are immensely talented at Ping Pong  but what differs is their attitude towards the game which also acts as their biggest assets and flaws. Peko is an over enthusiastic fellow and believes that he doesn't need practice as long as he can defeat his opponents. He skips practice, ridicules others and keep going off the diet and eating junk food. He doesn't believe in hard work and claims that talent trumps hard work. He doesn't develop his techniques and plays solely on instincts and basics. While his talents helps defeat weaker opponents although when matched against tougher opponents and when the going gets tough, Peko is defeated with ease. Peko also gets easily down when he is beaten and when upon being beaten by opponents he had defeated earlier, Peko becomes depressed and goes to the extent of quitting the sport. 
Smile is the polar opposite of Peko. Smile is calculative and intelligent. His play style is exactly that. He too is extremely talented and he mixes his brain with his talents to beat his opponents. Despite all his talents Smile is restricted by his anxious personality. Despite the fact that he acts tough, Smile gets extremely scared of the ground reality he is faced against. This results him in intentionally giving away matches and not playing to his full potential forcefully when faced against opponents who devote their lives to the game and who have a lot to lose if they are unable to win the game.
The anime deals with trails and retribution faced by the contrasting protagonists and their eventual growth. All of this is triggered when they each come across people who believe in their talents and encourage them to explore the same.
 The characters are the most important aspect of this anime and Director Maasaki has handled it with such finesse and grace which in itself is a testament to the man's sheer brilliance and talent. Each character gets his own set of ambitions, motivations, sadness and happiness and ample screen time to express and act upon the same which really fleshes out detailed and real characters. Even side characters like Kong, Kazama, Manabou, their coaches all are explored in the span of 11 episodes. You might think that 11 episodes are not ample to all this, even I thought the same before watching the anime but the depth of my wrongness cannot be explored by submarines.Smile and Peko both start as two boys who play the sport while having contrasting attitude towards the sport but their experiences and trials help them to come out as a changed and more focused characters by the end of anime. A supporting character named Kong comes to the team from China feels ostracized in the a new country with new culture and people. But his character progression is one of the best  anime as a medium can offer. He starts as an arrogant person and ends being one of the best characters of all time. This does not happen in one episode it was done with giving Kong constant screen time across the episodes which showcased his journey and struggle as a character. This is not just true for Kong but nearly all the important side characters. The screen time was divided between many characters to highlight their progress. 
Often I have discussed how most anime totally gloss over the dialogue aspect of the story. Dialogues are the second to just actions to showcase both story and character progress and this anime completely nails the dialogue aspect. Each dialogue is significant and each line spoken helps you and the characters in themselves to understand the characters better. 
Another aspect that is totally overlooked in anime is the direction. Most anime directors who have works often go for a very conservative and orthodox approach to direction. This makes the anime bland. There are some gorgeous animated scenes here and there in certain anime but that's just about it. There are not significant and notable experiments with the cameras, the shots and editing. Anyone who has seen Maasaka sensie's previous works is aware about his unorthodox approach to direction. The most visible aspect of it is the art style that is deployed in the anime. Most people would be instantly turned off by the art style but to the ones who complete the anime would agree that how important and how beautiful the art really is. This anime or his other anime like Kaiba and tatami galaxy all explore unorthodox and plain weird subjects and the art style deployed is perfect with the theme. The usual shonen art would not gel with this anime at all. But apart from the art too, the director goes for cuts like not other director. Often the scenes are divided into panels focusing on different characters to showcase the different points of life each character is struck at and the complication in their lives. It is said that eyes are a window to a person's soul and the director seems to strongly believe in that. So many of the cuts are close ups solely featuring the eyes of the characters and this alone is enough for the viewers to comprehend the character's situation and mood. Also, the director often goes for shots which are played in faster than normal stream which increases the tension and makes viewers be on edge of their seats. Thus, the direction of the anime plays a significant part in telling the story. 
The OST too are outstanding and are very diverse. When Smile plays the OST is akin to that of a robot esque music which brings in his personality. When Peko plays a faster OST is used to highlight Peko's attacking playing style. The opening is a hit and miss and was a miss for me but the ending is downright superb. There is one other song that is played in series and specifically in Episode 6. That is without doubt one of the best use of song in an anime. The song itself was sufficient to show Kong's integration into team and Smile and Kazama's slow but sure exclusion from the team. The scene was so well shot and the song chosen was so perfect that really made me feel somber about the current state of affairs of the characters in the anime. No sound is out of place and everything just meshes so well with the story that there can never be any complaint in this department.
Concluding my review, I would like to say that Ping Pong is a phenomenal and a game changer anime in both SOL and sports anime genre. Anyone who wants to watch an anime which focuses more on maturity and growth of characters rather than them just living each day as it comes must surely watch this jewel of anime.",10,CivilianHero

                 ""If you watch only one sports anime this year, it should be Ping Pong."" -AnimeNewsNetwork (2014)
Ping Pong The Animation is an anime for the veterans. It may not be suitable for the new viewers. No, not because it's story is tricky to catch, but because of it's art style. You thought this year's anime 'Mob Psycho 100' had the worst art style? One is the worst artist amongst all the mangakas? Think again. Also check out the trailer to get a good idea.
Ok, so art is not so good, so why am I suggesting this? Because this is one of the best anime I
                  have ever seen that concludes the story in 13 or less episodes. Most importantly, have you ever seen a sports anime from the psychological genre except ""One Outs""? Yes, that's right. This is one of the only two psycho-sports anime that exists! Talk about rare!
This is a masterpice example of psychological sports anime.
Ping Pong is a charecter driven anime so I will talk about the charecters mostly.
The anime introduces us with two ping pong geniuses called Tsukimoto, Makoto (Smile) and Hoshino, Yutaka (Peco). Including them there are four key charecters in the show.
""Chant these words three times in your mind!""
""A Hero appears!"" ""A Hero appears!"" ""A Hero apears!""
""Do that, and I'll come to you!""
This is the motivation that drives Smiles. He believes in real life and in ping pong court there is a hero who will save him. Smiles is a charecter who never smiles. So, why was he nicknamed as smiles? Because when he used to play ping pong, he smiled like crazy. But eventually he stopped smiling because he stopped enjoying ping pong, he still played like a pro.
Then there is Peco who don't care anything in the world but a natural ping pong player. Peco won a lots of tournaments at a very early age and used to think that no one can beat him.
Then their rival school brings in a transfer student from the land of ping pong itself, named Kong, Wenge (China). Kong is actually a tragic hero who is unofficially exiled by his country as he lost an important match in his country. And to him pingpong was life, and in china there are so many talents in the sports that it's very hard to keep up. So, it is his last chance in japan to prove himself by beating the best player of the country.
And the last key charecter of the show is Kazama, Ryuuichi (Dragon). He is the most hard working player to whom losing is not an option. His charecter has similarities with Akashi from Kuroko no Basket.
With so many well made charecters the anime pretty much shows all the sides of the sport. The struggle of a hard-worker, the monotony of a genius and those who want to reach their level have been shown so perfectly, in only 11 episodes! After finishing I thought I have seen something that has over 25 episodes!
The conversations are almost poetic. Every charecter had their own charm. The soundtrack was perfectly synced with the anime.",8,BL_NK
22135,"
                Let's start with this first - either Ping Pong gets too much praise is what some say, while on the other hand it gets too much hate. I'm here to give it a tinyy more leeway than either along with yes, this show is not perfect. However, it's still a fairly groundbreaking show and genuinely something in itself. Also, keep in mind that I prefer at -least- one or a few girls in the main cast, but that really is not this show. Do you see what I mean for one?
Gosh... the first few episodes for this show just made me think ahah, well this
                  show is pretty unique, but not anything super special. BUT NO it's so much more than that if you're someone who can see the hidden depths of a character. The story is also interesting enough since... is this about Ping Pong solely? Hm it might not be but do not misunderstand! It's about the characters AND ping pong versus solely the latter itself. Do you know those shows where it goes so deep into a character's backstory and it's either meaningless in the end or they never show up again? This series does neither and gives instead but depth and realism. For example to simply believe a character would do something -against- their will is a fairly absurd notion! There is not meaningless drama, there is reason, and past yet Ping Pong does not drag these things on endlessly.
Ah yes, the art - one of the biggest gripes most people have. Oh believe me! When I first watched the show I didn't like it, either! After I finished the show I purposely went back to rewatch the first episodes and examined the art carefully. I realized that it wasn't the art style that was so unappealing it was actually because I was saturated with SO many anime styles where they were so much less realistic. This show is NOT afraid to show you the elderly versus a supposed old parent with literally -three or four- wrinkles on their face. It isn't afraid to show you that people have different looks versus every attractive or unattractive person looks the same in their group. For example, stylized eyes solely for looks, all the same mouths, same slender body structures, very simplified noses... we don't have those here. If I have any art grips with this series it's one sequence in the animated opening (that I still find pretty strange) and the awkwardly put in original opening. But trust me the actual, true opening of this show? For the most part it's quite wonderful in matching the great OP song along with being an artist's dream, animation artist or not. Also give the actual opening some slack because one of the people involved? His motto is basically to always go off model because that's actually his style. The show itself though you won't find those inconsistencies if anything it's consistent.
The sound and music? This, this is where I would say the show has its falling out. I found very few tracks with this show memorable and I actually stumbled across the ost! Yeah, no, no kidding here I have standards and... I'm not into mindless edm for example. Electronic? Good. Dance? Good. Edm? Edm is rarely good and if you think so you're talking about wayy too over saturated and try hard music this is just cruel honesty. I tried pretty hard to listen to Ping Pong's ost and... that's... what some of the tracks reminded me of. But that isn't the only problem! The tracks also don't do a good job of conveying some scenes! And that's where one of the bigger issues is is what it seems like to me. You can dislike a series but still adore the music and that really is not what happened with me. I find the music quite average so it's somewhat of a shame, really.
It's obvious when the show does it, but wow. Characterization you say... also, you see... boy, girl, trans, bigender, doesn't matter if the character's a jerk and -especially- with no redeeming qualities I -already- won't like them. What's the point in being such a jerk you're not the king of the world deal. Hell, why -would- you want to be a jerk IF you're king of the world? However hear me out - when you start to see that there's more to a said jerk and there's actually -reason- for someone you thought was a jerk to lash out... it can change everything. Bear in mind! This character I'm talking about I don't even like that much! But it goes to show that there's an actual realism with characterization here, at least with the main cast. If anything I don't even the like main characters of this show that much, but ??? They're still endearing even though they'd be nowhere near my character favorites. Peco isn't a complete hero, but I find that was sort of the point and why a big layer of friction happened in this story in the first place. He's not an almighty hero, he's not a saint, but who is in reality? Who do you know is a true hero who would never do something bad if they could get away with it? If you know someone like this you're possibly just very lucky. What makes Peco special is his uniqueness in general, not just for a ""sports anime."" Smile? The way Smile was portrayed in Ping Pong is something that needs to be more often. Yes he's very gloomy but regarding some of his circumstances I can understand somewhat, why he's the way he is. It's in the -way- he was portrayed that gives him an edge with being more unique. There is -one- character who I... still don't really like, but he too, gets his development. Did he deserve what happened to him in his backstory though? Hell no that situation was awful. None of these characters would be my favorites but gosh was it good watching them try their very best.
It's obvious to see how much I like this show, but wait! I have more than one issue with it! However those are spoilers and instead, I tell you to not have expectations with this show like when I started it. Heck to make you feel better too I've rewatched this show a total of twice or thrice and what did I do? Have expectations, and what happened? I still enjoyed the ride each time and I do not regret it. If anything... you should be prepared for the ending because that's one of my issues with Ping Pong. The ending was pretty sudden and short to boot, even -if- it's a little longer than the manga. So yes while I thought the ending itself could've been stronger I STILL recommend watching this show. For Spring 2014's season, Mushishi, completely different genres is also good to the point where... it'd be unfair to compare these two anime. While I -do- like Ping Pong more as a show, Mushishi would be an experience in itself! But for the season Ping Pong was and IS still definitely a head of its time. If you go in with some judgment like I did that's fine. Just do not unfairly judge a show simply because the art isn't huge eyes with tiny mouths and necks so thin they can't support a head. You'd be kinda missing the point there, bud. I do hope this sheds more light on this series and I hope with or without me it'll lessen the unfair hate its gotten.

So let's get to the point:  If you don't consider this the best anime ever then you simply have shit taste. Period. And since apparently you have to write more I simply add this. No seriously I'm trying to be fun here can you please let me be not serious about this? Ok then.
10/10 story:
It's about the love between a boy and his balls. Ping pong balls ofc you b-baka. He aims for the top and overcomes the hardships of the sport called
                  ping pong. it's not some naruto tier bullshit '' I will overcome it with the power of friendship''. He uses his own sweat blood and motivation to become the master of hitting balls (ping pong related balls). But will he?
11/10 art:
now nigga if you talk shit about the art then you simply have no taste in anime what so ever. It fits perfect to the emotions expressed in this anime and gives the atmosphere something really special. This is the best part about this anime and if you don't appreciate it go back to high school DxD or HOTD.
10/10 sounds:
idk man sounded just about right to me + the song at the end put a tear in my eye so as far as I'm concerned it's a ten for me.

                Pretty good show, art is different and stylish, characters are fun and interesting, it's probably the most interesting ping pong will ever be in it's lifetime. Don't let the art put you off, nor the fact that it's about ping pong, the characters really do carry the show pretty hard, so that in itself should say how well they were written in. The ping pong scenes in themselves were actually not that bad, the art made it fun and the characters made it even better. So needless to say, if this show has slightly piqued your interest, I would say defiantly give it a shot.
                  First couple episodes should be enough to reel you in with its fun nature.
Story:
On the outside the story looks like it's about a couple of kids who want to play ping pong and win a tournament, but there are different little plots within the short 11 episode series. Each character has their own drive to play, some to win, and some to fill other dreams. It's beautifully achieved over the short span of just a few episodes, and I felt satisfied with it all at the very end. Without saying to much to anyone who has yet to see it, just imagine ping pong but interesting. I promise you, it's interesting.
Characters:
Now I know I've said this a lot in the top introduction, but the characters are superb! Like I said earlier, each character has their own drive to play the game, and there really is development within the few short episodes. The pacing for their development isn't rushed, nor is it too slow, it is just right. The comedy in this show is presented pretty well through their personality and actions, as well as the drama and action scenes. The style fits perfectly well with the characters in the show, and it's lovely.
Art:
The art is, different, as one could tell right away from just looking at the cover. I'm sure the art is what grabs peoples attention the most, which on that note I would like to say the art is amazing. I know the art puts most people off, and I want to say please don't let it put you off. It's easy to look past because there are other things in the show that would 'make up' for it. If you're one for art this show is awesome, and a need to watch. If art isn't priority, let this be your first artistic show, because it is actually interesting. Also I want to add that the music is great, I didn't really catch any annoying tune being used more than once, and if there were reused songs they were at least good songs. 
So overall this show is fantastic, look into it for a bit then dive straight into the world of ping pong!",8,ShadowBunny

                The animation in this show was amazing and worth the watch purely for its style. I love seeing anime that pushes the boundaries of convention in a way that is artistic, Ping Pong did just that. There were some breathtaking scenes that were matched by incredible sound design and score. 
Each character design was unique, the voice acting was good (though I felt they cast a little too old for some of the characters who are supposed to be teenagers) and I definitely got a strong sense for who everyone was by the end of this short show. 
The problem I had with it was
                  simply the story wasn't quite engaging enough for me. It was decent enough and I liked the characters, but I didn't feel truly connected to any one individual. It felt like a collection of character studies, which were great, but when the only thing that stitches them together is ping pong it's hard to get truly invested in the overall story.
Saying that, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Ping Pong, but for me it was a good ""one watch"" type show.",7,atarostarling

                This show is obviously very good. I give it an 8, but I can see why others give it a 9 or 10. 7, on the other hand, is too low. Here's why:
To me, 8, 9, and 10 means, this show is a cut above usual anime. The reason I cannot accept a 7 on Ping Pong the Animation is simply because Ping Pong the Animation is CLEARLY one of those anime that is just *built different.* The ingenuity in the animation is incredible. The style itself is unique as a hallmark of the show's director, but it also feels throughout that Ping Pong brings
                  out its style's fullest potential. This may be a rarity, but I don't think that there is any show better suited to Ping Pong's style than Ping Pong, nor that any style is better suited to Ping Pong than Ping Pong's style. 
As far as quality of story and character go, Ping Pong is most comparable to season 1 of Megalobox. That is to say, they work, but they don't break ground. They aren't really the centerpiece of the show. The substance of Ping Pong is not in the writing. 
It'd be a disservice to talk too much about the art and sound to an audience that hasn't experienced the show yet. Experience it for yourself.",8,GenghisKhan90210

                Tsukimoto, aka 'Smile', and Hoshino, aka 'Peco', are two childhood friends who grew with the a certain talent for table tennis. As the grow, they keep playing ping pong: Peco become an very good player and Tsukimoto remains an average/good player. Their vision of ping pong changes when a chinese player, Wenge, plays with Peco and defeats him. Peco starts an introspection after this and Smile begins to invest himself in ping pong. This anime deals with several themes as dedication, work, depression, hesitation, hope and has a multicolor palette of subjects, the ping pong is only a way to communicate these feelings.
Each character of
                  this anime go through the feelings exposed earlier, giving them a real depth and resulting in a real attachment. This evolution of each character is the quintessence of Ping Pong the Animation.
The art of Ping Pong the Animation is quite particular for an anime, but your eyes will be soon adapted and you will fully appreciate it. Despite appearing ugly at first sight, the animation reveals itself to be very fluid and never careless, contrary to Devilman Crybaby for example, of the same art director.
The OST is pretty catchy, especially the 'Hero theme' which stands for Smile's determination and intern battle. Each character has his own theme which reflect his own personality.

Chant these words three times in your mind! If you do that, Iâll come to you. Ping Pong the Animation is just more than a sports anime, itâs an anime about teenagers trying to find themselves through the game of ping pong. Each character is well fleshed out and serves a purpose. Even an easily forgettable character traveled all over the world to find himself. The story isnât limited to our main characters only, we see glimpses of others and their struggles. The animation might look bland at a first glance but the more you see the

                Ping pong the animation is a story about ping pong used to discover some deeper things within each character.
Story 9:  The story is about how a bunch of very well developed characters use ping pong to show their feelings. While ping pong is what is going on all the time in this show it is surprisingly not really the point of it.
Art 8: The art is definitely unique. It has the same effect as some lo-fi music has in being charming because its not the average perception of beauty. It's a totally different style that not everyone is going to enjoy. I personally liked
                  it and found it pleasant to look at which the fluent animation helped.
Sound 10: The sound design is absolutely amazing. The soundtrack is the single best anime OST I have heard. Voice acting is also very well done with an interesting dynamic of the Chinese characters.
Characters 10: The characters are what make this show so great. There is a surprising amount of development for an 11 episode show. Each character is very unique which makes it easy to debate with your friends what characters from other anime, shows, or even super smash bros melee players are what certain character from ping pong. 
Enjoyment 9: The show is very enjoyable with a good start and amazing final 4 or so episodes. There is a slight lull in the middle where more character development occurs and less important events occur. The ending episodes more than make up for this.
Overall 9: Ping pong the animation is amazing. With stellar characters and sound design and a unique art style it is one of the best shows I have had the pleasure of watching.",9,bunnyofthesea

                In my youth I had seen the manga for sale, but I never gave it the opportunity, but it caught my attention for some reason (big mistake). A few years passed and I was intrigued by the trailer for the live action Ping Pong movie, because they used a song by a legendary Japanese alternative band that I liked called Supercar, which some time later, some members of this band formed another called LAMA, together with Kensuke Ushio, despite that, I didn't see her at the time either (another big mistake). I recently started listening to the OST of Ping Pong The animation and I
                  was struck by ""Hero Appears"" and ""Hero Theme"", these songs drink a lot of the sound of LAMA and the OST in general I liked a lot. I said to myself, ""Well, let's give the anime in this manga a try.""
At first I thought it was the typical sports game, but as they tell you the story, the twists and turns it takes and the subtle depth in dealing with the human issues it deals with completely blew my mind.
One of the main themes that blew my mind was the theme of the hero and how the series was building it through the episodes. The theme of the hero is something that I have very well instilled since my childhood when I watched the Japanese robot series and Sentai on television. Although it sounds ridiculous to some people, in some way it has helped me to believe in myself or give me courage and strength in difficult times and thus achieve impossible things. This last time, as an adult, I have lost the passion and the way to do the things that I wish I could do. This series put me back on track to keep chasing those things that I used to love and I am enormously grateful to have seen this great anime.
Pin Pong The Animation represents that great legacy of more than 60 years of history that Japanese animation has included generations of children on the construction of the hero, that despite the defects and problems that we may have, we must not lose the will to believe in something that we really care so that it mobilizes us to pursue it. It does not matter that when you grow up you will not achieve what you want, because there are other paths in which you can explore, the important thing is to live the moment to the fullest and enjoy it, which is what this anime tries to tell you in a spectacular way.
After watching the series via streaming, I think I will buy the manga and the bluray, including the live action version because it is a masterpiece, the themes it deals with and how well the story is told.",10,fco_gon

                Ping Pong the animation is one of those series that you know is special from the first glance, because just by looking at the animation quality it maintains you know that you will at least remember something from this series; However, the series surprises for things such as its music, narration, endearing characters and above all teaching (of which, possibly it is your conclusion of it). The characters are charismatic, have unique personalities, and learn badly about their mistakes and actions. A wonderful play with cynical animation.
Is a special serie about the ""hero"", the friendships and The relationships. And it's wonderful how he does it

                This is my first review so it might not be great.
I enjoy sports shows but to me they have never been much more than entertaining, this show differs in that respect. I found myself invested in every character and I related to a lot of their struggles, they are written pretty much perfectly. I found myself really rooting for the characters to overcome their struggles and find their real passions and interests.  The music in this show especially in the first 9 episodes was incredible and really brought out whatever scene was on at the time. The art style was unique and refreshing, besides
                  a tad bit of cgi here and there the animation was great. I think the only real issue I have with this show is that it wasn't longer, a little length on the show would have allowed to see more of the action aspect. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen and I highly recommend it to anyone even if they have no interest in ping pong.",10,fredmister

I donât usually write reviews, but this anime surprised me a lot, just to say the least. 
To be completely honest, while watching the first few minutes of the first episode, I had a strong urge to just stop and drop the anime just because of its art style. I wasn't fond of it and didn't find it pleasing to watch at all. However, as the minutes went by, I found myself so immersed that I totally forgot about what bothered me in the first place. After the end of each episode, I
                  kept wanting to watch more no matter the art style. And even more surprisingly, as I kept watching it, the story was so captivating that it even made the art style grow on me, as I saw it complementing the story so well. This tells you how much good of a story this is. This is what every story should aspire to be. Invest you into the story so much to the point you find yourself forgetting about anything that you disliked (If you even did in the first place). Making you realize how good it actually is by showing you how each element complements one another so seamlessly: story, style and music. Making you then certain, that there isn't anything wrong or bad in it, but instead just an amazing example of visual storytelling. 
So to give an advice to anyone reading this who's on the fence in watching it due to its art style. I would like to tell you without a doubt to watch it. It doesn't matter if you're into Ping Pong or not, or if you like the style or not. I can promise you that at the end of the day, you'll find yourself watching an amazing story that will truly resonate with you. This is not just a story about Ping Pong, it's a story about humans finding themselves and ultimately... learning how to fly.

                   I have never done a review in this site, but this anime made me do one... What may look like a generic anime about sports ( Who thinks ping pong is brutally awesome, you know?) with an awfull art ends up being one of the most harmonic pieces of art i have experienced... The fact that this short anime is so ""underground"" is quite sad, in my opinion. Everything fits in each episode: the desing and art matches the flow and feel of the anime, as if the whole series was just an animated sketch, but instead of giving a vibe of
                  half-assed work, it gives an uniqueness to the anime.
   If you enjoy watching an anime that shows just how humans work, their flaws and ambitions and how that can influence how happy you actually are, while also enjoying some intense ping pong matches listening to a very well composed  soundtrack, do not miss this anime!",10,Gabud873

                The art of this anime was a lot different than anything I watched before, at first I thought i wouldn't enjoy this but then I patiently watched some more episodes and I started loving this anime, I liked this anime because I got to know lot of stuff about ping pong which I didn't know before like the different kinds of grips ,different kinds of rubber and all that .
The best part of the anime was the ending song which I really liked other than that I liked the story and development of characters, The art didn't really matter to me because the story and
                  development of characters was very good.
This anime teaches us that we can pull ourselves from the bad situations if we are involved in healthy competition and that one should not abandon doing what they love or what they are good at for losing in it once or twice.
I liked the character of Kong Wenge and Kazama because of  the kind of change they undergo throughout the anime.
The ending was emotional and it wasn't the kind of ending that I was expecting but I was all satisfied with the ending and I would like to suggest people who are demotivated to watch this anime , this stuff is really motivational. 
I am giving 5 points to the animation because I am not really sure about how I felt about the animation, I liked the art but I am not sure if I can really give points for this animation. I loved the sounds in this and the characters but the thing I liked the most has to be the ending song.",9,albertbolt

                Ping-pong is a rather odd show when looking at it from outside, mostly due to the shows art style and the sport the the character play ping-pong. I mean ping-pong is fun and all, but when people talk about sports especially professional sports I doubt that ping-pong would be the first thing that they would think of. Still thatâs the part of the show that the story and character gravitate around which are the factors that make this show a blast to watch.
Without looking really to into it the show is rather straightforward as it follows two childhood friends and ping-pong players as they go
                  through their high school career of ping-pong. Both characters contrast each other with Tsukimoto âsmilesâ being a stoic and serious type who has no grand ambitions with playing ping-pong but plays nonetheless, and Hoshino âPecoâ a more energetic and carefree type who lazes around but still has dreams of grandeur. Along the way they meet other players most notable being Kong and Kazuma who not only serve as rivals/antagonists, but as other characters with their own motivations which shows due to how heavily the show also focuses on them. Still i donât think the story itself is all that great since it just a series of ping-pong matches with very little at stake for the characters, a somewhat predictable storyline that becomes more obvious as the story continues, and some absurdities that really can take you off the show. However it does help that the show doesn't focus just on the sport, but also the character, their interactions,and their purpose. 
Each of the characters go through their own trials whether it leads to success or failure, and how they are able to cope with it. Itâs through the coping that the characters develop gaining new insight in life and purpose. Characters that seem like asses are given depth and growth that they become more endearing as the show goes along. Even when two known characters are matched against each other, and itâs obvious whoâs going to win. Itâs disheartening to see the other player lose. Sometimes.  Still i wished they expanded on some of the side characters because itâs evident that something there that can be looked into, but is just kind of passed aside. 
Yes, the artstyle does look very weird, and personally i thought i would have a hard time adjusting to it, but i actually found it rather easy to get used to. Still it does look silly, especially the character designs, and the animation in a traditional sense isnât that good as well. However as the show goes along itâs really hard to imagine the show looking any other way but this. The show uses the style to an effective degree to convey a message thatâs easy to grasp via visuals alone. 
The soundtrack for the show is alright i guess but nothing noticeable outside the ping-pong matches except when the characters sing during christmas, and the sound of ping-pong creating some sort of rhythm. The voice acting for the show however was good with everyone doing an exceptional roles with maybe a few jarring voices coming from some of the side characters.
Overall i really did enjoy the show. Despite itâs short run time of 11 episodes it was able to present a great cast of characters, and a quick story that doesnât overstay its welcome.",8,LaLeLuLiLo

                Being the 3rd sports anime I watched, after Haikyuu and Run with the Wind, I was in for a totally different style in both art, pace and tone of the series. Compared to the rating of the series, I was disappointed
Story 7/10: The story is rather weird at times. Focusing on character less important than the main characters, which makes me feel I'm following the main characters in 3rd person. Also many scenes seems irrelevant for such a short series. It could have been spent showing more about table tennis, that feels rather unimportant, when games are skipped quickly mostly just showing some clips, and
                  skipping to result. No character thoughts or progress trough a game. General pacing is often confusing and the watcher has to figure out himself when a timeskip suddenly apears several times out of nowhere. The power level of some charcter just shifts very quickly for weird reasons. And one of main characters seemingly so strong, yet seems to have no interest in table tennis.
Art 5/10: So, the art of this series is probably a love or hate for many. I did not like it at all. It reminds me of Attack on Titans art from the ugly titans, and it just gets you down, rather than excited. The pace of some scenes become way to fast, while the art is also very unclear and blurry, makes it hard to enjoy. Hardly ever seen clear character face expressions. The only positive about the art is some of the animation techniques used. Others, like the multi split screen, doesn't work very well often.
Sound 7/10: I'm not a big fan of the opening theme, compared to the ending. Guess it's just taste. Most of the characters where male and the conversations are very dull, which sets a very unentusiastic conversational tone. Also at one point there is this annoying battle music whenever the Kano players are shown. One refreshing positive note is the actual chinese and english spoken by the characters, rather than only japanese.
Character 8/10: Characters are some of the only bright part about this series. And feels like the creator builds the series around these. 
Enjoyment 6/10: The whole tone of the series, from the start is very dark and depressing compared to other sports anime. All the characters are negative (except Peco), they boast and talk shit, making players feel like shit and qutting Table Tennis (including me wanting to quit watching) There are very few female characters (like 2x5 seconds in the first 4 episodes) which makes only hearing angry young males complain for over an hour constantly, just a bit over the top. I did not get hooked, and pushed myself to push trough every episode, which is not good for anime.

                I was someone who hesitated watching this show for a long time. The animation seemed horrible and the whole concept of Ping Pong as an anime was strange to me. Somehow, it not only exceeded my expectations but has made an impact on my life. I have been anxious about my life in sports for a long time since i missed out on going pro and this show has really helped this anxiety. It has made me realize that you should enjoy the times for what they were and to keep moving forward. The animation will take some getting used to but fits really well
                  with the story. The story is generic in a Unique way. The classic sports anime trope is there but it feels fresh. They characters also seem kinda bland at first, especially Smile, but he grows on you. Everything about this show becomes better and better everytime you rewatch.

Ping Pong the Animation is what I would consider a perfect show. I don't like to call things perfect but PPTA checks all the boxes. The amount of emotion, character, and story fit into just 11 episodes is astounding. In these few short episodes lies the greatest coming of age story I have witnessed.
The first thing I want to address, the elephant in the room, the art style. I can't argue for an art style and convince you that it is good but I can explain why I love it. I feel like PPTA's art style perfectly complements the emotions the show emits.
                  These simple monotone drawings with light pastel backgrounds complement each other so well in this style of animation. You can truly feel the pulse of each character and each match through the vibrant animation. The art feels so meek and shy which is very fitting for PPTA, being a very intrinsic experience at times, despite this the animation will always breath life in to every scene better than any fancy art style could have done for this show.
There is no true ""main character"" in PPTA, each character gets developed like they are the focus, and if it weren't for screen time it would be impossible to tell. However, the 4 most important leads are defiantly Smile, Peco, Dragon, and Kong. Each character goes through a wildly different character arc despite them all playing the same game. Each character in this story works as a counteracting force to another, which leads to conflict and development. Characters are shot down for others to fly, but one man's failure will always lead to his eventual success. Even the most insignificant characters will get development, development that is unheard of in such a short time frame.
Themes in PPTA are the driving force behind its greatness. PPTA is written much like a book, using a plethora of symbolism, irony, and other rhetorical devices that create such dense themes. Each character represents another different theme; Loneliness, Overconfidence, Failure, Shame, Selfishness, Humility. This show will have you feel so much emotion for every character. 
The plot is really captivating; Its crazy how invested I got in these tournaments. This plot feels realistic despite it centering around a sport. What's great about the conflict in this show is that you can't predict what will happen. Many times while watching I got fooled in to thinking there would be an obvious winner, which really adds to the realism. This is because all these characters are is just a group of kids. The plot's climax in tension is at episode 6 which is the start of a narrative shift in the show. Episode 6 is my favorite anime episode of all time but I digress. This is the point where each character faces their hardest struggles, each struggling with something specific to them. After this halfway point all of the character's finish their development and everything ends, beautifully.
There's not much more I can say without spoiling but do yourself a favor and watch Ping Pong the Animation.",10,sonofbun

                In terms of sports anime, this is another excellent one. It's clear that this anime is a creation out of passion for art and for sport. The charts and diagrams and the dynamic poses and stunning strokes..! The rhythm of the animated ping pong matches was so lively, the ping-pong equipment talk was SO NERDY, the animating team clearly did their research!
The music is SO thematic and sets the tone excellently, there are constant pop-culture references (Akira!!! NGE!!!), and the animation ... wow... This is anime, visually, at its finest. Exaggerated motions, blurs and smears, so much use of contrast. There was a scene with
                  a flashlight and the RESPECT that the animating team had for light and dark in that scene.... Perspective was just wild, no rules just guidelines, and combined with a moving ""camera""....!!!!!! There was a variety of textures, the colors were interesting and moody, and the way they drew out split-second moments, it's almost undescribable.. the athletes would be running fast while the scene passes in slow motion, only anime could make that look right lol
There was one thing I really didn't like about this anime. Not like it's a huge flaw or anything, but I guess the characters bored me. They would just offer their short monologues while joining their peers for a thousand-yard-stare, or be yelling about how passionate they are, or they would just. leave. just cuz fuck you i guess. It was hard for me to keep watching this one, because of the dialogue being too boring or too confusing for me to follow. There are MANY characters from different schools, and the anime often cuts very quickly. There are also frequent semi-metaphorical flashbacks and personally i found that confusing and unhelpful, but yknow, the music and animation teams carried still. It's all very anime!!!! I enjoyed it despite my confusion! Maybe if I watch a second time, I will be able to keep track of all the characters and their relationships to each other..... We'll see haha
Similar anime, cuz i love sports anime: 
Hajime no Ippo- also very individualistic, sports anime about boxing, however this one builds up the interpersonal relationships and the warmth much much better, though it's a much slower paced show as a result. 
Haikyuu- This one is a lot less individualistic, a lot less artistically talented, way longer, and way way cuter. That's it it's just kawaii cute haha
If your passion is closer to writing and storytelling, I think you might find this one to be a little disappointing, tho maybe it'd be a fun study! Every beautiful work has room for improvement!

Overall--> 8-9   Im not really sure if I should give this show a 9 or a 8 but I think the 8 fits it better in my opinion. 
Thank you for rading this review.

                Ping Pong the Animation is just great. The animation is fantastic. The art style is unique and refreshing. The story with all his philosophical and psychological aspects is awesome. The characters have so much depth and are well-writen that the relationships between them are extremly interesting and dynamic. Mind-blowing were also the ping-pong games. A big thank you to Tatsunoku Production who shows us how many different ways there are to animate the same sport. Every game is a new adventure for the viewer. (My personal favorite were Kong vs Kazama but none of them were boring). The ending of the anime was also fine.
                  In total, this anime is a must-watch for everyone who love innovative ideas.",9,BeagaKing

                Without any doubt that ping pong the animation is the greatest sports anime of all time!
While other sports anime walk on tropes and clichÃ©s ping pong the animation strives on originality and great characters.
speaking of the characters the characters are phenomenal and you get to feel the points of view of every character and you get to root for all of them and get attached to them. the artiste is pretty to look at and flows like water. when character makes a decision I feels like a human made it and not a anime character like while i was watching I never went 'that was
                  stupid why would they do that' and they did it would be a rationale decision that anyone would make in the situation.
it truly is a phenomenal show and would highly recommend 10/10!",10,Anime_Boy69

                I want to like this show more than I actually do. First off, itâs racist (Iâll explain in the Writing section). I would have dropped the show by the end of episode 5 if it werenât for Kong, my favorite character. Seeing that he reappears in episode 8 encouraged me to hang on. Episode 10, the second to last episode, was the first ostensible feeling of fun I had watching the show. Episode 11 then wrapped up the series in a satisfying manner. 
- Story. This show is 40% sports 60% character arcs. There were a couple revelations about character backgrounds and relationships that pleasantly
                  surprised me. However, the pacing was too slow. Half of the main and supporting cast are unlikeable for the first two thirds of the show. Kong and Akuma had the tightest narratives, with clear motivations and actions resulting from their internal struggles. The others had several logical inconsistencies that got in the way of convincing storytelling even though I understood what the show was trying to say with each of them.
It follows that the payoff of episodes 10 and 11 took too long to arrive. In my opinion, there was enough imagery and foreshadowing that 2-3 episodesâ worth of B-roll and extraneous side plots (such as one characterâs weird incest romance, or a mere background character's soul searching journey) could have been cut. It was not worth my time sitting there waiting for things to âget goodâ between Kong episodes.
- Characters. Each character grapples with what ping pong means to them. Why do they work so hard to train? Why do they want to win? Why do they like to play? Do they like to play? Who are they playing for? The answer is rooted in their individual pasts and life experiences.
Kong is the star of the show for me. He faces high stakes pressure fueling his desire to win. What is most compelling, however, is how he deals with his trials and tribulations. He changes so much as a person by the end of the show. His reasons for change are open to interpretation, but I think the show gives me enough information to come to a conclusion that makes sense to me.
- Art. The lineart style is exceedingly HIDEOUS! In fact, the lineart is so poor that a character who changed his fashion sense was literally unrecognizable until another character said their name. It made me realize there are basically no character models for faces. As for the colors, I liked the pastel-like shading style. It made some background scenes look really nice. 
- Animation. Decent for a lower budget show. It is rough around the edges, yet it fits the unhinged art style. There is some weird 3-D CGI, but I think the team did the best that they could. They made interesting stylistic choices such as animating an actual arrow as the ball travels between players. I was worried about the recycled animations, but there was only one episode in which I fast forwarded through them.
- Music. I thought the soundtrack (synthwave/electronic vibes) was fantastic. The use of the music transformed the mood of the scenes. 
- Sound design. The actual selection of sounds was fine, but I noticed several moments where the sound didnât sync to the animation. Most frequently, a shoe would skid on screen and the sound came late.
- Writing. What's up with the casual racism? Kong is referred to as âChinaâ throughout the show. Not âthat Chinese guyâ or âChinese playerâ, just China, as in the entire country. While they called him China less frequently out loud as the show progressed, they still referred to him as China in writing on screen and then once more in episode 8. While his Chinese identity is part of his character development, I don't care for this offensive delivery. Early on, they also threw in a stereotype about black people being good at dancing, in order to combat stereotypes (the irony). Who greenlit this? I expected better from 2014.
Even though relationships are supposed to be a core theme of this show, several depictions did not make sense. Without giving too much away, the friends in this show seemed to support each other less than their rivals/antagonists. It was hard to believe the utter dearth of empathy between two characters when they were extremely close childhood friends. Their supposed fallout was not properly explained (I wasnât buying the one-liner provided in the show). Furthermore, Peco and Smileâs team has zero camaraderie - we constantly see the bad blood between seniors and first years -- and somehow they are on good terms at the end. The seniors had even expressed their bitterness at being neglected by their own coach, who focused all his energy on developing Smile.
Smile and his own coachâs relationship was also unconvincing in comparison to Kong and Pecoâs relationships with their coaches. I do not understand where Smile and his coach began trusting each other and working together. His coach seems more interested in beating the competitive drive into Smile instead of drawing out Smileâs intrinsic motivation.
Speaking of character motivations, a couple of main characters had confusing turning points in their motivation. I could identify that there was supposed to be a catalyst, but not what it was in the scene. I had to look up other peopleâs interpretations online because the show didn't leave enough breadcrumbs to figure it out myself. 
For some reason, this show likes to tell you all about Smileâs prowess rather than show it as it does for the other skilled players. It was irksome to hear a side character remark for the umpteenth time that Smile was a ping pong monster murder machine. I think we got it the first time, and the second time, and the third time, as they played robot noises synced to his movementsâ¦ His matches were boring and predictable.",4,pickyviewer

                I think most people have already said everything there is to say about it, but for the sake of myself, I'm just going to write down what I remember.
I've seen this twice now, and I can reassure myself that I enjoy this one.  I will usually recommend it to people that don't particularly like anime, or specifically sport anime, as I feel like it was a good intro for me.  I think that people overhype it though, it's good no doubt but the story is kinda... it leaves a lot to be desired.  It goes along fairly well, but I wasn't wowed
                  like I initially was the second time around.  I think there are better stories for sure, but the art and animation really carry it so it's excusable.  Not saying there are any plot holes, but it feels a little bare (maybe I just don't have quite the same taste for sports anime anymore).",8,Tomu-Kiku

                Ping Pong the Animation feels like it was tailor-made for me. It tells the story of 5 table tennis competitors in a period of two years, and concludes it with an epilogue 10 or smt years later. And all is creative choices are made in order to develop those 5 characters, so that they come of age. Poignant af, and especially relatable to me, because I used to be a precocious depressed math competitor, PPTA really hit home. To top it all off, this anime does not feature any of that shitty anime comedy that makes me inhale slowly and sigh with regret.
I would love
                  to praise every aspect of this anime to high heaven, but I feel it would be redundant and inappropriate, because I adore it so much. When one loves something, trying to objectively analyze it sounds stupid, self-indulging and superficial (looking at you, anime youtubers) Still, I am obligated to say for the sake of promotion that the Tenderness and China OSTs make me tear up every time (post-PPTA.) Kensuke Ushio is my Final Fantasy VII.
Just watch it. You might feel like everything you have seen before is BS post-PPTA (sports anime are now all the same BS to me );) so be warned. If the animation is putting you off, know that it put me off when it came out in 2014 as well and l was retarded back then. PPTA's style grew on me a lot because I liked the show. While watching it, surprisingly I never found it ugly, or too quirky. I get it too, if the sports anime story is typically not your thing - it isn't mine either. However, know that PPTA is a sports anime only when it comes down to the setup, tropes, and epic moments. At the heart of it, the anime is about 5 lovable goofballs, 3 cute old timers, numerous losers that don't matter (but make you cry nonetheless,) and the drama between them. Ping Pong the Animation is a love letter to table tennis and a tribute to youth.",10,kapu02

                idk if its only because i just finished watching the last episode, but ive been watching this anime slowly enough that i can be sure im not giving it such a high rating based purely on my feeling right after watching it :P
i went into this like ""ah i heard the animation is outstanding and beautiful, i guess its worth a shot"" bc i dont watch sport anime, i have never seen the appeal and i dont like watching sports so why would i wanna watch a sport anime right..? Well ....... this is so much more
ping pong the animation is seemingly about ping pong
                  but under the facade of ""sport anime"" you get a beautiful story with lovable characters and touching moments.. ive cried too many times while watching this anime during moments im not even sure i was supposed to cry in
this is a story about well... life, and what i really loved about it is that its not trying to be dramatic or special or extraordinary or anything like that. you have tsukimoto and hoshino - two extraordinary table tennis players, but their environment, their life, everything else about them is just normal. theyre human and i love that
the way all the characters are drawn is much more realistic than average anime, and doesnt make the characters especially attractive. its not trying to make anything look pretty -- until they start playing table tennis
the animation and movements are AMAZING and i enjoyed watching the matches for the animation alone, except theres so much more depth to every match, it means so much more than just table tennis, each character has their own struggles and expectations from themselves - and it really made me see myself in them, in their one-of-a-kind personalities despite their ordinary lifestyle, in their mistakes and desicions.
the last thing i want to say about the story is .. its about friendship, more than anything. it starts off with friendship and ends with friendship, its about friends helping each other out, making each other smile, pushing each other to the limit when no one else would and at the end just being there for each other
its so well crafted, every single episode, and it makes you stick your eyes to the screen out of fear of missing anything...!!!!! its the best anime ive watched in a really long time and as i moved thru the episodes i knew i had to add it to my favorites because frankly ive never seen animation like that in Any other anime !

This anime is good.
CHARACTERS
The characters are fleshed out. Their troubles hit close to home. 
Hoshino's sad state when he was demotivated is similar to how I feel sometimes. I'm glad he came out of that phase, it gives hope for me. 
I'm glad Kazama doesn't feel as stressed as before when thinking about ping pong. I would've liked to see the process and the realization. 
Some character changes felt rushed, like Sanada giving up his infatuation with the ad girl. 
STORY
The ending episode(s) felt weird:
- First, the final tournament. It feels like a lot less effort went into hiding the plot armor. I definitely felt weird after Hoshino beat Wenge and Kazama since they trained really hard, a lot more than Hoshino. Maybe it was to illustrate once again the importance of talent in winning.
- Second, the time-skip at the end. I'm glad there's a happy ending. I felt emotional. But I was a bit disappointed that it's like a happily ever after. Maybe it's better than a forced sad ending, I don't know. I'm glad all characters are doing well.
ART
Rough lines made for more dynamic feel, sometimes. 
It helps also that I didn't find any of the characters attractive just because of how they look. If I did, it was because of who they were.
SOUND
Opening has some lyrics that make me emotional when I see them.
ENJOYMENT
It's 3:46 am as I write this as I finished watching the anime. 
Definitely the emotions are stronger because I'm in a though spot. I have a lot of responsibilities I've ran away from that are on the verge of collapsing on me. 
I empathized on a hard level with the characters and I hope I can stop running away. 
OVERALL
A great watch. The characters are well developed. There are many lessons to be taken too.

                I have to say this was one of my favorite animes I've watched in a long time, absolutely wonderful and memorable one.
The animation is weird, and it can be both ugly and beautiful from one second to the next, without breaking any flow or sticking out. The animation might be a hard sell for some people, but the way it's use is definitely allows for both some fantastical and yet also realistic visuals. Blew me away at moments yet keeps things grounded for the more serious scenes.
The sound/music is absolutely wonderful, if I have to rate the soundtrack I would put it in my top
                  5 favorite anime soundtracks of all time. Everything about the soundtrack is perfect for the series, and I had some of the songs stuck in my head for the past few days since I've finished the series.
The characters are absolutely amazing, all of them coming together over the intensity and love of Ping Pong, or also what Ping Pong represents to them. I can't give away any of the plot, but I feel like almost every character was memorable in this series, or played a purpose in the plot.
Should also give a shout out to voice acting, honestly had some of the most amazing/naturalist voice acting I've seen from an anime. The characters are totally believable in delivering their lines, there's two characters who speaks both Japanese and Chinese and they nail both languages and the acting so wonderfully that I was amazed. What's painful is that apparently they and some of the other voice actors haven't gotten more roles in anime, they're clearly talented and amazing based off just the work they put into this series alone.

                --This review contains major spoilers, read the TLDR if you don't want spoilers--
--TLDR--
Ping pong the animation is a masterpiece. The animation does look a bit weird but trust me, this is not your average generic sport show. Watch it.
--Spoilers onwards--
What does it take for a sport story to be perfect? Well look at ping pong the animation. It is one of the best if not the best sport anime in history. 
Well, why? First of all, the story. Sure, you can say that ping pong the animation is just playing at tournaments, but it's much more deeper than that. Tsukimoto is someone who is talented
                  at ping pong, but cares more about other people. When he goes to a tournament, he meets Kong Wenge, who wants to meet his family. When he sees Wenge getting annoyed by his coach when Tsukimoto is about to win, he just loses... not for his sake... but for Wenge's sake. Unlike your typical clichÃ© in sport anime where the MC is able to get overpowered and win the match, Tsukimoto lost on purpose for someone's sake. This is an example of proper writing and not using the same clichÃ© over and over. Well, what else is there? The Kazama match with Peco. Kazama originally was just some super super strong dude who cared for his team, but he figured something in his match with Peco. Fun. That's right. Something so simple. So how? We get to see Kazama developing from this match where he's struggling, to a match where he doesn't care whether he loses or not, and just wants to have fun. And finally, one of the greatest ways to end sport anime IF not the best. Peco and Tsukimoto in the final. Flashbacks of Tsukimoto and Peco's childhood were shown, even adding more emotion. And guess what. Another thing that ping pong the animation does different than your usual sport Shonen; the MC just wanting to have fun with his best friend even if they lost.
That's all what Tsukimoto wanted to do. Going against a match with Peco in a fun all out match. That's all he wanted. This is absolutely perfect. I'm not even giving the story a 9.9/10, it's a definite 10/10.
While the story in ping pong the animation is magnificent, the art feels a bit weird. Racquets look a bit wonky; faces look a bit off; and the ping pong balls seem a bit weird. Other than that, the art is honestly pretty solid. It's not perfect, but as ping pong the animation wouldn't be ping pong the animation without this art. A solid 7/10 for Art.
Sometimes the sound used in ping pong the animation is a bit out of sync (e.g the bat hitting the ping pong ball isn't on time). Even though, most of the sound used in ping pong the animation is pretty good and is on sync. Some of the sound worked better than your usual sound effects. The bat hitting the ball is perfect; it's exactly what I hear in real life. A high 9 out of 10 for sound.
Unlike your typical sport Shonen, the main character cares more about the opponent. Usually, the protagonist is a cocky kid who gets stronger and stronger; but that's set for another character in our show; Peco.
Tsukimoto, someone who wanted to hide and stay away from people.. ""It's safe here. I want to stay here."" He found a fun game called ping pong and loved playing it. 
The best part about Tsukimoto is that he doesn't care about himself in a ping pong game... he cares about the opponent. This is different from the usual main character, who cares about themselves more.
I will admit that Peco is a bit of a copy paste, because his character is a cocky teenager. He may be a copy-paste character but he's likeable.
Kazama was pretty much that one guy who was strong but wanted his team to be really good so they can win the tournament... his development with the battle against Peco was not rushed and perfect... experiencing a fun match in a while. Kazama is a great character.
Wenge was someone who wants to visit his parents which are in another country. He was playing ping pong for that. That was a really solid background. Wenge is a bit cocky but he thinks rationally and takes the right move... another great character.
10/10 for characters.
When it comes to ping pong (the sport) I enjoyed it. So I would expect to enjoy ping pong the animation, which I did. It may've been a bit slow at points, but I enjoyed this sport all the way to the final episode. The op was absolute rocking, while the ending was pretty chill. I loved both and made me want to sing it sometimes. 10/10 for enjoyment.
Ping pong the animation is different from your usual Shonen sports. It has a great sense of originality and different  art from your usual anime. What's more, the story came with perfect-timed character development and was perfect overall. 10/10 for ping pong the animation.",10,_Redo_

                Art / Animation - Interesting and well suited artstyle with gorgeous use of animation to convey emotion, power or whatever else.  10/10
Sound / Music - My favourite OST to date with unique masterpieces like Ping pong phase 2 which uses the sounds of ping pong balls and shoe squeaking to make a great track. Songs are incredibly used for hype and emotion and not a single time is the music out of place. Sound and noise in general is also used to show how the characters are feeling as well in this show.  10/10
Characters / Development - All the characters are extremely strong
                  in this anime, and have vastly different backgrounds but you can empathise with any of them. They also all develop a ton in a realistic way for realistic reasons.  10/10
Plot - Fairly normal sports show plot, but it's fine since characters are more of the focus in this show. I did however really enjoy the ending and the little post show ""what the characters are up to bit"".  8/10
Enjoyment / Mood - With such great characters and music this show is one with emotional up and downs with some incredible hype moments, but just as importantly those ""Oh shit"" moments. Its not to binge and very enjoyable.  10/10

                Ping Pong the animation is quite a unique sports and coming to age story. Honestly, the story is pretty normal, and if you've read enough stories, you would most likely know what was going on after episode 3. 
That said, the story isn't exactly important. It's more of the way the story is laid out and how characters get to the ending point. And it's pretty good. The art and sound are obviously amazing. OST and characters are very good, especially Peco's voice actor: spot on. Art is representative of Taiyou's artstyle (I looked up the manga), and looks great even when animated, despite being
                  completely different from standard and traditional art styles. Nothing to say about these two things. Just well made.
Really, the meat of the story is the characters and their progression. It's not that bad, but honestly, it's also not that great? Character personalities kind of go as they please, and a lot of the characters act very weirdly and randomly. Lots of focus is given to the wrong characters, but all in all, it's still fine. It's supported by great art and sound,  so it passes.
Overall, its pretty good. I was a little disappointing with how characters progressed, which I really did think could have been more well made. Perhaps that's also just a distinct creative liberty Taiyou has, but it does not mean I have to like it, obviously. It's hard for a review to give this show justice. You should just go check it out, it's worth a watch.",8,PixelB

                For those put off by the art style, please give this one a shot. The style was initially offputting to me, but, after a few episodes, it really stuck and even enhanced my experience by the end. The story focuses on characters on the spectrums of talent, hard work, and love of a game, and how characters in different places of these spectrums can be silently suffering and find relief. Overall, the themes explored here really reminded me of Good Will Hunting, but, for me, Ping Pong lands at a much more balanced and cathartic conclusion to the questions of ""what does it mean to
                  have talent?"" and ""who do you play table tennis for?"".",10,opseal

                Alright. Ping Pong the animation was a fantastic show.
For me , this show wasn't about ping pong but about the story of tsukimoto and peco and ping pong just happened to be a part of their story. 
Ping pong gives you insights into lives of different types of players and the way they look at that sport.
It 's greatest strength is it's characters. From different players like Smile ,  peco to even coaches like koizumi. It focuses on everyone and they all provide major contributions to the story.
Masaaki Yuuasa's unique style of storytelling is quite clearly visible in this anime as well.
Some shots in
                  the anime during matches feel like they're literally panels taken out of a manga the way our screen is divided into 3 or 4 parts. A character that I personally loved in the series was kong wenge. The music was great as well. Especially loved the ""hero"" song in the finale. 
So overall summing up this review, this anime was about tsukimoto calling out his hero for years and what happens when that hero returns.

NÃ£o apenas sobre ping pong, PPtA entrega com competÃªncia relaÃ§Ãµes exteriores ao jogo. Namoro, trabalho, famÃ­lia, tudo isso Ã© bem explorado sob medida sem perder o foco no principal que Ã© o esporte.
Hoshino e
                  Tsukimoto representam o velho dueto impulsivo/emotivo vs. inteligente/calculista. A vida de ambos e os flashbacks que justificam suas personalidades e motivaÃ§Ãµes atuais Ã© bem trabalhada e o protagonismo Ã© bem revezado entre ambos durante a obra, sendo particularmente um deleite para meus olhos.
Por estes e outros motivos a histÃ³ria de PPtA Ã© facilmente um 10. Mas por que nÃ£o posso dar um 10? Simples e Ã³bvio: a animaÃ§Ã£o.
Se pudÃ©ssemos fazer uma analogia da obra como um todo eu compararia PPtA com um ambiente extremamente agradÃ¡vel, aconchegante e convidativo com um esgoto Ã  cÃ©u aberto ao lado. A incrÃ­vel histÃ³ria de PPtA Ã© capaz de te conduzir a fazer vista grossa para a animaÃ§Ã£o, com toda a razÃ£o. Mas ela estÃ¡ lÃ¡ sempre evidente principalmente em momentos de aÃ§Ã£o como nos jogos, muitas vezes com frames parados e com pouca diferenciaÃ§Ã£o entre um jogo principal e um ordinÃ¡rio, entregando pouca clareza do que realmente estÃ¡ acontecendo ali. Tudo Ã© mal desenhado e inconsistente, inclusive personagens de primeiro plano. NÃ£o bastando isto, multidÃµes e outros elementos que compÃµem o plano de fundo sÃ£o horripilantes. Como Ãºnico ponto positivo digo que a perspectiva e o enquadramento surpreendentemente sÃ£o competentes e tornam uma cena ruim em aceitÃ¡vel.
Infelizmente existem muitos animes com excelente animaÃ§Ã£o e uma histÃ³ria porca e cheia de fanservices, enquanto outros tÃªm uma histÃ³ria fascinante para contar, porÃ©m sem uma animaÃ§Ã£o Ã  altura para entregar todo seu potencial. PPtA encaixa no segundo tipo.",6,HenriqueDM_7L

                Ping pong the animation:
What does sport mean to you?
You can tell me you want to be on top of the world, a fun hobby or even reduce it to the stereotype of ""It's just talent"". In a narrative where the heroes don't actually exist to save you, but give you the chance to save yourself and show your abilities, your weaknesses, your disappointments and certainly the most beautiful thing about you, Matsumoto brings us a work that demonstrates how something as trivial as our love for something can reflect on our persona.
As we are shown the face of the character egami, who after a crushing
                  defeat to Tsukimoto tries to seek a journey of self-knowledge and ends up realizing how wrong was his decision to abandon the sport. It is noticed that both victory and defeat can have an equal weight for the athlete, making such thoughts as arrogance, arrogance, lack of skill is a reason to continue in such activity, being notorious both in mediocre players and those with enviable gift.
Friendship, hate, envy, uncertainties will be present in the life of the one who has decided to dedicate his life to something he really likes and even more for the one who lies to himself about his feelings in relation to what he really wants to do.
Finally, that you can really enjoy the best experiences with teammates or even opponents within something you wanted to do yourself. So that we can be our own heroes who will come to save us.",10,JohnOhumano

                I came to watch this anime after learning that it was done by the same guy who directed ""Tatami Galaxy"" and I really fucking liked that anime. The way it ended and the overall message behind it was wonderful. So, naturally I had high hopes for this one too as it was even above in rating than Tatami Galaxy, but I have to say that I am a little bit disappointed.
The anime started out great and I was really loving the 'hero' part as it reminded me of ""The Magnificent Steiner"" from Monster. It really does depict properly both sides of winning and losing. Everyone
                  has reasons to win, everyone faces repercussions on losing, it's true. Some lose their way after losing like Hoshino while others try working harder for the next time like Tsukimoto aka Smile. It was fine until here but from here on out it starts to get really unrealistic which was really off-putting to me. While everyone is working their ass off day in and day out, Hoshino is lazing around and even starts to smoke! I found this really weird that he  just made up his mind to get back into the game and was able to recover just by working very hard. I get that he worked really hard, so much so that one of his knees gave out. This is my second major issue. A knee injury is not something that you can brush aside. No matter how much natural talent you may have, winning against a fucking olympic gold medalist is not an easy feat and if you have a knee injury it makes it exponentially difficult. But he ends up defeating Kazama. It was just for the sake of plot because he is a 'hero' and Kazama was in need of a 'hero' to help him. Then he beats Tsukimoto and goes on to play on an international level. 
So...Hoshino used his knee which was already a little busted to play against an olympic gold medaist and Tsukimoto who was just as good as him to win and it didn't cause any problems later on?! You have got to be kidding me. If  only the ending was a bit more realistic it could have been a 10/10 for me. Don't get me wrong I can get behind an unrealistic ending too but only in fantasy, not in a sports genre. Specially if it takes place in a setting such as this clearly depicting other people's hardwork, perseverance and aspirations. 
My score break up is:
Story: 6/10
Art: 9/10
Sound: 9/10
Character: 6/10
Enjoyment: 7/10
Overall: 7.4/10 => 7/10 on MAL",7,isekun

                The first 5 minutes of the first episode are so important, they are what determines if people watch the show or drop it. And there is one moment in the first episode (2:50) where it sort of freezes on this dudes face and it looks horrible. It made me want to throw up. ok other anime have slow/boring first episodes like d-gray man, gintama, steins gate, princess Mononoke ect. but I have never been straight up disgusted by a first episode until I watched this. I can guarantee 99% of the people who watched this dropped it at the 3 minute mark bc of that
                  1 decision.  
And the rest of the anime has way better art, great animation (these matches were hype even though I was disappointed by how short the final match was) and looks way better. But it doesn't matter bc the first episode had terrible looking art and everyone dropped it. One punch man would never have been popular if the art was trash in episode 1, even if the rest of the anime was the same. The animation in this anime wasn't quite as good as One Punch Man (let's be honest, no show is) but it is pretty close. It feels like the entire episode is sakuga, it's sort of amazing. But it doesn't matter. First 5 minutes of the first episode, if you mess that up the rest of your anime is  irrelevant.",8,Hiddena0

                If you like coming of age stories than i recommend Ping Pong The Animation. I won't lie, the art is excruciatingly horrible but after not too long you get used to it and come to not mind it. The story is great. You have a main cast of about 4 characters, each which have their own inner conflicts and as the show goes on you dive deeper into them.
I wouldn't say this is a sports anime, more so an anime that uses sports as a gimmick to help push it's themes and metaphors and such. At 11 episodes you'll be able to get through it
                  fairly quickly.
Definitely check it out.",8,titogonzalez
22135,"
                The art, as you can imagine distinguishes this anime from the get-go, putting it closer to ""Aku no Hana"" and further from most sports anime. Accordingly, the story is leaning a lot on the characters& their struggles through the lens of the sport, not that much on the sport itself.
Plot-wise, expect a classic sports anime set up that doesnât stray too much from that, complete with a tournament arc. It does have a full ending though which is always a big plus.
A top player who tries as hard as he possibly can, does everything mechanically, just to win. Winning is expected, not fun.
A skillful player
                  who is afraid to win, so he prefers to run and hide from his bullies and personal demons.
An arrogant player who talks big but now can't land a single point against a strong opponent. He promised to be a hero, but the hero never came.
Old players, trying to keep the new ones from repeating their mistakes.
The way the characters interact with each other and is great, learning and overcoming their problems& growing stronger accordingly. All of them have very different issues, so itâs not repetitive.
The animation is a big selling point, as it can warp and bend in accordance with the directors ideas, without hesitating to go past whatâs pretty. This is a critical point that quite a few watchers might not be able to go past. It really fits the plot though, adding a gritty quirkiness and is a big part of the anime. Without it, I think the anime would lose a lot of its appeal.
Personally, even though I appreciated all of the above this anime didn't quite hit the mark to go above a ""good"". As I mentioned, the characters and their development was good, but plot wise it didnât hold many surprises and was pretty weak. Most side characters were neutral to indifferent and aside from very few points I couldnât bring myself to cheer for the main 3 characters. Art was fitting, not exceptional, but it carried the show nonetheless. 
Overall: Worth checking if you have the time and feel free to decide on your own!",7,Yuki_Raine

                Honestly I didn't think I would like it as much as I did, but a friend of mine really likes this anime (says it's his favourite), so for his birthday I said I'd watch it lol. No regrets.
The story really had me invested all the way through, and it made me care for each character individually, especially Smile and Kong (the Chinese was great and not cringy which is a plus), they were my favourite. The animation and visual was interesting, never seen anything like it before but I feel like it added to the story.
I really liked the stuff about hardworking vs talent and
                  the crude reality of only having hardworking sometimes isn't enough and you need both to really be at the top. 
I am disappointed at who won the match in the final game, I wanted it to be the other player (if you've watched it you know who I mean) But I love how it wrapped everything up in the end.",9,Moonie-ssi

                Ping pong the animation is probably the best show to give a full character arc in 11 episodes. And it does it for four separate characters. This show is great at a lot of things, but I rated is as a masterpiece because it led us through a genuine journey. This is a show that is about the characters, and how they deal with life and their philosophy through ping pong. I cry my way through the final arc every few months since I watched it initially in the beginning of last year. The art is interesting and strange, but youâll grow to love and
                  appreciate it. The cinematography is unlike much else Iâve ever seen outside of western comic book movies, but is done in such an interesting and unique way that it feels brand new. I canât recommend this show enough.",10,Aniko61

                Just got done watching the show a few minutes ago and it was a masterpeice The way the show makes you feel like your in those ping pong games in the audience is great. It like your always on the edge of your seat watching these characters learning more about them each episode. This was extremely enjoyable and super fun and also this is my first port anime lol. i really love the animation its kinda like a manga cause they split the scene up a bit sometimes. The characters are cool sometimes funny i really like the main character i kinda relate to him
                  a bit. Not gonna spoil but i think the end was perfect. The music was relaxing and clam and it fit the vibe of the scene.",10,CosmoMcFloso

                Blood tastes like iron. We are all alive. Table tennis is a freaking blast.
This anime might not change your life, but it explores inspiring themes like the benefits of hard work, what it truly means to follow a passion, and what loving life is all about. This show is the most concise, meaningful, and complete display of humanity I have seen in any media.
The amazing soundtrack that always perfectly match the feeling of a scene, the unique art style that exudes emotion and life, the phenomenal screenplay that pulls your heart in all directions, and the deeply empathetic characters that each represent a different way
                  of interaction with passion, evolving as players and humans, give this show not only depth unlike anything else I've ever seen, but a feeling of pure fun through and through.
Every time I come back to it, the lens through which I think about the themes has changed because of my own growth, and it never fails to give me new wisdom.
I recommended this show to all of my friends and I am pissed that they haven't watched it yet, which is why this review HAD to be written. It needed to come out one way or another.

                In my Mononoke review, I stated: ""I doubt I'll be coming across anything quite this jawdropping any time soon"".
Well...
...
I was fucking wrong.
Ping Pong the Animation was directed by the great Masaaki Yuasa and is the official anime adaptation of the word ""Passion""--as well as the original 90s manga, of course.
Everything about this show revolves around this concept.
""Passion"".
""What is your passion?""""What brings out the passion in you?""
""WHO brings out the passion in you?""
Perfectly illustrated by how it chooses to focus (not just address, FOCUS) on many different Ping Pong players and how each one perceives and relates to the titular sport. As said in the show: ""Who do you play for?"" Sure, there may be the two REAL main characters, Smile and Peco, but the show still manages to go out of its way to flesh-out every character who seems to be in any way ""important"" to the narrative. (One random, seemingly expendable, dude loses once and, instead of having his story end there, we constantly get glimpses of where he chooses to roam after said defeat) Touches like these are what make the narrative feel so real and touching. I mean, THAT and all the visual metaphors that are thrown in once in a while as to better illustrate what the characters are feeling (the most prominent ones being The Hero and The Robot). Plenty were the times where I found myself in tears, be it from sadness or from pure untamed JOY.
All this being achieved in less than 5 hours, mind you.
Now, I could easily end this review here and call it a day, but... That'd be doing a HUGE disservice to all the staff involved.
Every faced of this production seems to have been miteculously crafted into a most beautiful whole, thanks in no small part, to the great Masaaki Yuasa himself.
The OST was incredible, the voice acting was impeccable all around, the pacing was ""yo mama's PUSS"" levels of tight and the visuals... Oh, mah boy, the visuals. They may turn some people away at first but they have at least three major points in its favor that completely invalidade any ""supposed"" faults anyone could see.
First- Objectively, the animation looks super fluid.
Second- It's intentionally like that so it can stay close to the original source material.
Third- It looks unique amongst this sea of same-y designs and styles we seem to be getting.
And a surprise fourth reason:
It strengthens the inspirational message it aims to achieve. Having it look this ""cheap"" and ""unprofessional"" automically makes the overall product look like an underdog in and of itself. It's like something ANYONE could draw. A 5 year old, with enough practice, could pobably draw something similar to this so maybe YOU could maybe get this far one day too.
(Not really. The proportions are too precise for just anyone to replicate... But the illusion's still there).
I try imagining this as a normal looking shounen and I (no joke) cringe.
What we have is great. What we have is special. What we have is near perfect.
What we have...
Let's us fly.
