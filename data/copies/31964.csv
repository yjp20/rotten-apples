*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*
Inspired by American superhero comics, Horikoshi Kouhei's Boku no Hero Academia (or 'My Hero Academia' in English) manga started publishing two years ago, but got gained a lot of popularity only after the release of One Punch Man anime. But being honest here, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by it.
Story: 6/10
The story is rather childish. In the world of My Hero Academia, on one fine day, out of nowhere, new born babies started having some random super powers which are called 'quirks'. With that, evil villains emerged, and with that heroes emerged
                  too, which soon became usual and was accepted by the society. Our main protagonist of the show, Izuku Midoriya, who is always bullied by his childhood friend Bakugou Katsuki who has a great quirk, wanted to join the prestigious 'Hero School', UA, and become the best hero in the world like 'All Might'. But he discovered in his childhood that he is 'quirkless', but finding the potential in him due to various situations, All Might passes on his quirk to him which is somewhat like ultimate strength, speed and endurance. But due to his weak body and lack of practice, he always hurts his body due to the recoil. Anyway, he manages to clear the UA entrance exam and now he must struggle in the school to pass out as a pro hero.
Okay, so far so good. But from this point, the excitement goes downhill. Bad jokes, predictable events, childish plot, and what not, makes it seem more like an American Cartoon than a Japanese Anime.
Art: 7/10
Bones Studio, very popular for it's work in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,  delivers some of the best artworks out there. But this time, it gambled with My Hero Academia. The graphics are very sketchy and it feels like we are reading a comic book. It may be a hit for some people. But honestly speaking, it was a miss for me.
Sound: 9/10
There is no doubt that Porno Graffitti, the most misunderstood band name, did an amazing job for the OP with the song 'The Day'. The fast and catchy song and the visuals along with it are very good and fits the mood. 'Heroes' by Brian the Sun is another great ED. And guess what? Kaji Yuki performed the role of Todoroki Shouto! Also other talented voice actors like Okamoto Nobuhiko, Suwabe Junichi, Kitamura Eri, Yuuki Aoi, Inoue Marina did a great job. The OSTs during the action scenes are really good too. 
Character: 6/10
This is the biggest negative point for the show. The characters, are well, lame. Everyone is either silly or one dimensional or simply annoying. They all have unique quirks which make them different from each other. But still, they are lame.
Bakugou Katsuki is the lamest and the most annoying of all the characters. He exists just to bully Midoriya Izuku to make the anime more shounenish. 
Midoriya Izuku is no good either. A lame-ass who usually cries over stupid things instead of fighting like a man. He is a fan boy who cries tears of happiness like a girl when he is able to see some pro hero. That's seriously lame. 
All Might, the strongest hero in the world is the silliest childhood-hero like character. He has got some weird hairstyle and dialogues without any punch. He has one alternate form in which he shrinks to a thinner size with a gunny un-proportional face and body, which may have been shown for comedy, but I found it silly. 
Eraser Head is the only character whom I found interesting and mature. Reminded me of Kakashi Hatake from Naruto. :P
Enjoyment: 8/10
I enjoyed the show only in some parts of it (mostly the action part). The rest of the show was silly, childish, predictable and it felt like it was targeted for pre-teens. But anyway, if you have already watched a lot of good anime, then this anime is suited for casual watching.
Overall: 7.2/10
If you are a pre-teen or younger, you will like or maybe love this show. It has all the scenes and factors which today's generation kids love (I guess). If you are a matured adult who is not into silly comedy, bullied-kid-turned-into-superhero or someone who finds funny villains evil, you should probably avoid this anime.
Tl;dr:
+Sound
+A few action scenes
+Good for audience below the age of 16 years
-Poor plot, many loopholes
-Silly and annoying comedy
-Silly and annoying characters
-Comic book sketch-like art
-Not good for mature audience
It's like a rip off of Marvel, DC and One Punch Man. But a bad one. Good for casual watching, if you have already watched a lot of good anime and have nothing new to watch. If you like shounen super power anime, then you will like this anime. I have a feeling that the sequel is going to be better. Let's wait and see.",7,Rkpandey

                Tackling a show in a negative light is usually a very tricky task, and even more so when the show in question happens to have a huge and very outspoken fanbase here on MAL. I'll consider myself to be endangered from the moment I click the submit button for this review, as these people will show no remorse if your opinion happens to be on the more negative side of things. However in this particular instance, I figured that taking the risk may be worth the trouble, seeing as the show in question is very undeserving of the praise it has gotten so far. Boku
                  no Pico Academia is another run of the mill battle shounen about overpowered teenagers doing overpowered things.  It tries to be slightly different in essence but ultimately crumbles under its own weight.
The story is set in an alternate universe where 80% of the population have received superpowers (Quirks) and evil is running rampant. To protect society from these villains, numerous heroes have emerged over the recent years in order to make justice triumph and bring peace to the citizens. Our protagonist is Midoriya Izuku, a shy 14 year old boy who's aspirations ever since he was little were to become a hero. Unfortunately for him, he is not a part of the overwhelming majority in the sense that he has no Quirk of his own which is why he is regularly ridiculed and looked down upon by the people around him.
All of this is put to a stop when he is conveniently placed under the strongest hero of all time, Allmight. After going through a harsh training routine for a solid 10 months and gaining a Quirk of his own, he is finally deemed worthy to join the ranks of other overpowered teenagers alike and enroll at the Hero Academy in order to groom his newly-formed power and finally qualify to be a real hero, thus making his dreams a reality. Though that is just the glorified way of saying it. Around here I noticed that the story often struggles with balancing whether or not it wants to handle this plot in a serious manner or a not-so-serious manner, which makes up for some rather rough transitions down the road when the serious arcs role around.
Anyhow, the premise of the story is not the problem I have with it, but rather it's the way they went of doing things. I was personally hoping to see the plot move in a bit more serious fashion or maybe have a bit more focus on the implications and alternation of society as a whole from suddenly receiving these bizarre super powers out of the blue. Though this is a shounen after all, so we ended up taking a more shounen-ish approach to things as we follow Deku and friends through their many trials and tribulations. Unfortunately, when compared to series of the similar nature like last year's One Punch Man, it ends up falling short.
With other genres to the side, a big portion of time and effort is spent on action and comedy, as you would normally expect from a shounen series. The action scenes are usually handled fairly well due to the bizarre nature of the Quirks and there being basically no limitations to what one can and can't do which in turn makes up for some interesting scenarios. And Bones being Bones, the animation is as consistant as you can imagine. The comedy, on the other hand, is very lackluster and more often than not just ends up falling completely flat. And if it miraculously does somehow end up being even remotely funny, then you can be sure that they will re-use the same joke 5 times over and run it to the ground. A good example of this would be the gag of Allmight being anorexic.
This section plays a significant role in the series decline as like with most other shounen, the characters aren't developed that well at all. Though, that is not something I should entirely fault it for, especially considering the genre at hand. However, Boku no Hero Academia misses a very crucial opportunity here. Do you know what all the top-tier shounen all have in common? They have an actual likable main cast of characters.
Thus, we enter Midoriya Izuku, otherwise known simply as Deku. Deku, being the protagonist of the story of course doesn't have a quirk of his own and was therefore looked down upon by his peers throughout his entire life. The amount of victimization they give to this character can get pretty overwhelming at times, seeing as at one point he is laughed at by everyone in his classroom even with the teacher being present and everything. They really went all-out to make this guy the ultimate underdog, to the point where it sometimes just irritates me to watch him. He's weak, can't stand up for himself and is socially awkward around girls. However, this all changes when he conveniently meets up with his favorite and most powerful hero in all of existence and gets taken under his wing. After that, he is fed a piece of hair, thus receiving superpowers. Hooray! 
I really thought it couldn't get any worse but here we are. Bakugou Katsuki is Deku's psychopath of a childhood friend, his biggest bully as well as his possible rival later on. He is usually a tool from which Deku's victimization during the series stems from, as Kacchan here is completely mental. It is heavily implied throughout the series by Deku that he became the way he is now after ""straying off the path"" and receiving his Quirk, yet it was clearly shown in multiple flashbacks what an egotistical maniac he was even during his childhood. There really aren't any justifiable factors for this guy. His character is very basic and doesn't ever go beyond him being a self-absorbed cunt who wants to be the best at everything for extremely shallow and selfish reasons. 
Then there are some other main characters that didn't leave me much to write about either because they either weren't utilized properly or were just not very good. Allmight is the object of Deku's admiration as well as his questionably-anorexic mentor. He usually ends up defeating the villains in a few seconds and has some semi-inspirational dialogue throughout the series but is ultimately overshadowed for the majority of the show, up until the final 2 episodes. Uraraka is pretty cute and ends up giving Deku panic attacks whenever she talks to him due to his seemingly crippling anxiety around girls. I don't remember the armored guy's name but he's pretty cool. As for the antagonists, their motivations never get explored and we're just left to our imagination.
The art for Boku no Hero definitely isn't bad by any means, it's just very unappealing so to say. With a very cartoonish style to it, it has a sort of unique feel to it, yet still somehow looks ugly. This complaint is nearly nonexistent when it comes to the backgrounds but is very much there when I stare at the character designs for too long. Midoriya's design faintly reminds me of diarrhea, for one reason or another. Bones has continuously produced some of the best animation through each passing season for years now so no surprise here. Since it heats up during the intense moments of the show the fights are quite nice to watch. Most of the tracks from the OST were unnoticeable apart from the main theme and another track which's timing was nailed very well every time to enhance the feeling of dread once the antagonists showed up. I enjoyed the ending and especially the opening theme a lot and the voice acting was solid, albeit there were some performances that I found to be annoying.
The enjoyment of the show will mostly depend on how big of a fan of shounen you are. If you go in with the assumption that it will suck, you may be pleasantly surprised like I was when the latter half rolled around. It has deplorable humor which is a miss in 90% of cases which can easily ruin a series for me and that really was the case for the first few episodes, but eventually I just tried looking past it. The final 3-4 episodes of the show is where shit hits the fan and I don't remember the last time I was this entertained while watching a seasonal anime. Essentially, if you're a shounen fan looking for some dumb fun you'll probably love it, and if you're coming in with a skeptical mindset then try to look past the first few episodes, as the show gets better the longer it goes on.
In conclusion, I don't think Boku no Hero Academia is that bad of a series. Sure, it has its fair share of problems here and there but what my rating mostly stems from is when I compare it to other series in the same vein, be it a regular shounen or the example that I have previously mentioned which is OPM. It has a story with some potential to be found but a very mediocre and slightly disappointing execution, with every character in the show being either extremely unlikable and annoying or simply bad. At times it takes itself too seriously and at others not seriously enough, which makes up for some pretty awkward transitioning.
If you're a fan of shounen series, I'd recommend Boku no Hero with a grain of salt as hopefully you don't come in with your previous completed series being FMA and end up setting the bar too high. Though, if you're an easygoing person who's just looking for some dumb fun then this is definitely your go-to this season. All in all, it's not bad and is certainly not good but mainly fails to live up to the hype created by the community.",4,Captain220

                Boku no Hero Academia is an anime that lives and dies by the conventional. While that could be seen as a negative feature in most scenarios, for a superhero shounen that understands its limitations, it's actually quite refreshing. 
Being satisfied with maintaining a status quo in a medium that constantly pushes the envelope may seem like the wrong direction to take until you come to realize the confines the show is working with. While some shows of this nature tend to sabotage themselves with poor narrative decisions, most are usually knocked off, not by their content, but by their desire for more, despite not having
                  the material needed to back it up.
Shounen stories by design are meant to facilitate the fundamental building blocks of easily digestible themes. It's for that reason that the main demographic targeted is first and foremost young boys to teens before concerning themselves with any other group. While some titles have successfully escaped this genre's trappings to garner appraisal from a more demanding audience (Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter X Hunter, etc.), most of it tends to fall apart when they attempt to push beyond the capabilities of its written material (Owari no Seraph, Blue Exorcist, etc.). This isn't to say that a creator shouldn't attempt to do more if they think they're capable of pulling it off, just that knowing what material you have to work with is also key to creating a successful work. You can't exactly create thematically rich content from something that didn't contain it in the first place, but what you can do is make the best product possible with the hand you're dealt.
And this is where Boku No Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) comes in. It's a shounen story that isn't ashamed about its humble offerings, nor does it display delusions of grandeur for accolades out of its reach. While other content creators are busy navel-gazing, Academia uses that time to create something that's full of whimsy. It's an anime that lives comfortably in its realm of customary standards. And really, isn't that enough? Academia doesn't work because it offers more than other atypical shounen titles, it works because it decides to be the best it can be in its current position that it's given. And what better way to show strength within one's limitations than by having the story revolve around characters that put forth their best effort in the face of adversity.
Academia tells a story that I'm sure most anime viewers are familiar with. The classic underdog story; the naive boy growing into his own, the bonds he forms with like-minded individuals, and the life lessons he learns along the way. It's a simple tale, one of perseverance, childish ideals, and believing in oneself. Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya is that naive boy, and the object of his admiration is that of All Might: the idealized embodiment of peace and justice. The story chronicles his attempts to become an admirable hero like the one he looks up to, as well as seeing him overcome the obstacles he's bound to face in the uphill battle that he's undertaken to get there. 
Set in a universe where superpowers manifest itself in 80% of the world's population, becoming a professional hero has become commonplace. These innate abilities that people find themselves with are referred to as ""Quirks."" Naturally, the 20% that's born without a Quirk is at an inherent disadvantage to the rest of the population. And as you would guess, our protagonist Midoriya is one of these unfortunate people that life handed lemons to. Despite his situation, our protagonist still desperately seeks out the chance to become a hero. But it isn't until a fateful encounter that his dream could become a reality. Fast forward a few months later, and Midoriya finds himself at the gates of one of the most respected schools for heroes in training. And so begins our tale. 
The first thing you'll probably notice about Academia is just how expressive its art and animation looks. The show looks like colored panels jumping right off the pages of its manga counterpart. This is further illustrated by the dynamic movement of the characters, instantaneously eye-catching character designs, and an ultra-vibrant color scheme. Studio Bones rolled their sleeves up with this one, delivering a visual spectacle that they're known to be capable of. A firework display of showboating talent that the studio has earned across the many years in the industry. And since they're adapting the material verbatim, none of their infamous plotting issues makes its way into the narrative, making Academia into a cohesive body of work, the likes of which wasn't pulled off by Bones since their adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's the studio at its best, which not only spotlight its talents to others but also helps Academia to shine its brightest. 
To further heighten the visual treat, we're also given a soundtrack composed by Yuuki Hayashi, which was, for the lack of a better term, hype-inducing. Lending his talents to Kiznaiver, Death Parade, and other projects, Hayashi is quickly making a name for himself within the industry and is a talent worth keeping on your radar for future works to come. With veteran Sound Director Masafumi Mima lending his talents to the project, together these two men help shape the auditory section of Academia into what it is. It's a commendable effort that's deserving of the praise received.
And just like the presentation of the show, the characters are just as lively, with a broad range of personalities and superpowers to boot, as to be expected from a show dealing with superheroes. While they're all fairly stereotypical, what they lack in layered character detail, they more than compensated with spunk and attitude. Their eccentricities added to the show's tone and lighthearted nature. They're in no way innovative or new to the genre they're a part of, but they still serve their purpose for the content at hand. 
This extends to our protagonist Midoriya as well. He is your archetypal lead in every way possible. Replacing him with almost any other shounen protagonist would yield very little change. What is interesting about him, however, is the handicap that he's strong-armed into working with. Because of the inherent nature of his power, he is forced to make compromises to avoid extensive injury to himself. Since he spent his entire life taking notes of the anatomy and capabilities of other heroes, he's more astute than his peers. This allows him the ability to plan accordingly, especially under stressful conditions that force him to be quick on his feet. As the show goes on, this analytical prowess of his doesn't go to waste. He brings this talent to each physical encounter he's placed in, making combat situations a balancing act between outsmarting his opponent, as well as mitigating potential risk to himself.
Speaking of physical encounters, since our protagonist makes an effort to think tactically in the midst of battle, the skirmishes he gets into are far more entertaining than what you'd typically expect from superhero brawls. Of course, he's still a kid, so these tactics may not be the most riveting things to see play out, but it still beats seeing senseless bishounen cock-fights that resort to shouting and punching wildly to achieve results. This was also prevalent in other physical altercations throughout the show. Again, while not the most imaginative fights, they were still a cut above the usual standards of the battle-shounen formula. This doesn't mean that hotheaded characters grew a few brain cells all of a sudden, they still acted in a brash manner befitting their personality; but for those that have powers or limitations that needed adjustment, they found ways to innovate whenever it was necessary. 
With the trend of superhero stories becoming ever-present across all storytelling media in the last few years, the marketplace has gotten to a point where it's on the verge of stagnation. For the general populace, that point may not be that prevalent yet, but for those vigilant viewers that recognize the pattern, it's a backlash shit storm just waiting to happen. Boku no Hero Academia is just another drop in the bucket. Inconsequential. A blip on the radar. But that's also the beauty of it. It's not an anime that hurts the medium, nor is it unwarranted to most that sit down to watch it. It's just an honest-to-god shounen. No gimmicks, no underhanded attempts into duping its viewership to take it more seriously than they need to. It's just a sincere piece of media made for the sole purpose of entertaining its audience, and perhaps even more than that for those wide-eyed youths that sit down to view this type of story for the 1st time.
That sort of honesty in a time when desensitized audiences have grown jaded to what's offered to them might just be the remedy needed. I always want to see the medium push forward, but when a break is necessary, I more than welcome the likes of shows like Academia. It's fuel in the fire to keep going. Easygoing entertainment that I could trust at face value won't give me the runaround. 
Academia is a rare case where it's good because it's average, and I know that may leave many of you questioning how something could possibly be both, but really, that's the only way to explain this show's predicament. We could commend a show for trying and succeeding at doing more, as one should when a title pushes beyond what's standard fare. But at the same time, there's nothing wrong with appreciating a title that chooses to be good in a way that's not necessarily innovative in the market it's a part of. This will be an instance where the score of ""5"" isn't used to insinuate inferior goods, but rather one of accurate assessment of the product at hand. It's a good show for its target demographic, just an average one given its placement in the broader landscape of shounen material. Its modesty is endearing. And in a time when titles either conflate their worth or uninspiringly follow a checklist for a quick profit, Academia proves that just being yourself is never a bad thing.",5,ZephSilver

                ""All men are not created equal. This was the reality about society that I learned at a young age of four."" 
Thus begins the journey of Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya, a dreamer, who's passion and wish is to become like his idol and role model, the Symbol of Peace, the one and only All Might. 
There was never a shadow of doubt that My Hero Academia was slated to divide opinions among fans for all the not quite correct-- but inevitable reasons. Enter Izuku Midoriya, a cheerful but an extremely introvert middle school teenager who feels neglected by the society, not because of his depressive tendencies
                  or anything but that he's a ""Quirkless"" among the more common ones born with ""Quirks"". Quirks are something which has become a norm in the world of My Hero Academia. Nowadays most people born in the planet consist of the 80% of population which mysteriously develop supernatural powers titled as Quirks. Quirks can vary from the personalities to the genetics of the given person, and there is no clear explanation as to how the powers can manifest within a human's body. As quickly as one can comprehend it, this is the way of life portrayed in the series, and it revolves around Izuku, who is now one of those rare cases where there is no sign of a Quirk developing in his body. 
Fans of the Shounen genre know all too well what to expect from the series. And for it to be coming with an ordinary premise that has been done multiple times within the genre (Which as I said earlier can divide opinions easily.), My Hero Academia certainly has its highs and lows. It gets off to a cheesy start with its nail-bitingly snail-like pace and has a nostalgic feeling to it, albeit the premise gets the better of it and it feels very underwhelming. At this point it doesn't provide sufficient meat to the viewer and it doesn't come off as surprising if the viewer decides to drop the show. While the show picks up on it and precedes it by changing the momentum and present more material to the viewer, the inception of the series leaves a bad aftertaste which cannot be shrugged off. After the initial first four episodes, the series starts to change gears and while it becomes more battle-oriented, it also doesn't leave out the characters that drive it and adds more to them. Once Izuku establishes his very own skill set after registering into the prestigious school of heroes, The Yuuei (U.A.) Academy, things look brighter for him and there's more insight to what creates and identifies him. The mid phases of the series is also where the rivalry of Izuku and his life-long friend and also enemy, Katsuki Bakugo, is at its peak. 
Izuku Midoriya takes the center-stage in the show accompanied by All Might, who Izuku thinks of highly and his childhood rival, Katsuki. Izuku is  depicted as a very timid, a slightly eccentric but still a cheerful boy who's one and only wish is to be a hero like his idol. In a matter of thirteen episodes, My Hero Academia manages to flesh out the basic characteristics of Izuku as he tries to overcome bullies who ridicule him on being born without any quirks. The show doesn't shy away from flashing the reality across Izuku time and time again, which gives it a little more meaning to the trials Izuku has to overcome to become like the hero he always admired. Katsuki Bakugo, who Izuku dearly calls as Kacchan, is the exact but a superior opposite to Izuku. From a very early age he is shown as someone who has immense pride in himself. This is only justified more when Katsuki's flashy quirk manifests. The middle stages of the show focuses more on the one-off between Izuku and Katsuki, and excels at presenting Katsuki's extreme pride in himself and him having a superiority complex. All Might can be said to be the most polarized character from the show. What starts as a super hero with generic drawings and whose power is not revealed, leaves a trail of identity behind which makes the viewer slowly draw in towards his charm and ultimately like him towards the end. 
I have always been a fan of Studio Bones and their extremely quirky and exaggerated drawing style. My Hero Academia was a case of the two making a perfect couple. Put together with Horikoshi Kosei's Marvel and DC-inspired characters' art style, Studio Bones did what they do best at presenting the honest and fluid animations as they always have. While its a perfect ten on the visual aspect, its also a subject of mere taste. Many are put off by the Americanized character designs and personalities. So in general, its a hit or a miss on the visuals. 
Getting to the sound and auditory aspects of the show, the voice acting of the characters plays a big role in conveying the full material to the audience and it was no different with My Hero Academia. Yamashita Daiki's vocals are synced to perfection with Izuku's timid characteristics. He also does an excellent job at being rational and calm while doing the narration as well. Okamoto Nobuhiko's presenation of Katsuki was nothing short of a spectacle in the show. Katsuki's psyched up reactions are handled masterfully by the pumped up and convoluted voice of Nobuhiko. Not to say that Kenta Miyake's job as All Might was any easier. ""There is no need for fear. Why? Because I'm here!"" These lines always burst out the joy within me. ""The Day"" by Porno Graffitti was a perfect choice for the intro and for a classic battle shounen such as My Hero Academia and it will definitely make your blood boil. In a season filled with some amazing openings, The Day without a shred of doubt took the spotlight. ""HEROES"" by Brian the Sun was nothing short of amazing too. It was more centered around Izuku's character and him coming of age. 
If you love shounen anime's, then My Hero Academia will deliver. There is no doubt about that, but its a matter of perspective. It has fights which are more tactically focused and it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, and has cool characters with some ridiculous powers. My Hero Academia has a wider prospect as a second season is officially announced. The first season is an answer to the potential to be good, and that answer is yes.",8,karlstein12

                If I were to ask you what you aspired to be, what would be your answer? Everyone lives their life chasing dreams, no matter how big or small. Dreams, goals, aspirations; these elements make up each individuals world and are part of what keeps life unique.
The dreams we focus on throughout the anime Boku no Hero Academia are those of Izuku; a young boy who aspires to be the greatest hero in a world filled with heroes. This is no menial task, seeing that each man and woman in this world was born with a quirk (superpower) that gives them a clear advantage over young
                  Izuku who was curiously born without one.
Now, originally I had planned to give this anime a lower score (8 or 9) to try to tend my review to a larger audience. The reason behind this decision was because the show itself was nothing notably different or unique. The story was that of a young man who wanted to be a hero, and who accomplishes such through blood, sweat and tears. In retrospect, it's a story we've seen hundreds of time throughout the years in anime. 
Now, take a moment, and peer at the world ""originally."" I had *planned* to give this show a lower score because I knew some people felt it generic. This is something I had considered around episode 5 - 7. I've now finished the show, and have tossed that idea in the trash and burned it. 
This show, in my honest opinion, is a must watch of the Spring anime season and is well deserving of a 10. The story is indeed something we've seen a multitude of times before, but this show took that story and made it special. I've seen so many zero to hero animes that I never would have imagined watching another that could illicit the emotions this one did in me. This show managed to pull my full attention and to really immerse me in the world it was meant to portray. 
I found that by the end of the series I had grown very fond of the protagonist for his die-hard attitude; and had found myself inspired by All Might, the same man who had inspired our protagonist himself. All Might was one of the best representations of a role model character I have seen, he was actually an adult I looked up to in an anime, which is truly something special after all the side character adults I've seen in shows who are simply there to crack a pun every episode or two. To add to this, each character in the show was given a unique personality that didn't fit any prior anime cliches, something I feel is uncommon in this age of anime.
The sound work in the show was fantastic. The OST fit the setting and genre of the show, and the OP and ED are both ones I looked forward to listening to each week. The art was well done and I never noticed any 'lazy' frames or glaring mistakes - the animation was smooth and enjoyable.
All in all, I really enjoyed watching Boku no Hero Academia. The show felt very much like ""Haikyuu"" in the sense that you wanted to see each character succeed and left the show each week feeling motivated to be the best version of yourself. If you've not already seen this show, then go watch it - if you dropped it because you felt it was generic, I suggest revisiting it; it's well worth watching.
Now get out there and be your own heroes; I'll see you again for Season 2.

                Perhaps the next “big thing” by Shounen Jump. It was inevitable that Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) would get an anime adaptation. A matter of time and it eventually did. The premise is rather simple and classic for a battle shounen. It takes place in an academy setting with the main character trying to become a hero after being inspired by All Might (his idol hero) and others who vowed to protect their world from villains. Up to this point, there has been all sorts of battle shounen series adapted by Shounen Jump so it was time for superheroes to step up to
                  the plate.
The main character, Izuku Midoriya is a young boy who is born without powers. As such, he is mocked by peers, especially a childhood bully named Bakugo. As evidenced from many flashbacks, he is mocked because of how useless he is while the most of his class all developed powers (or otherwise known as “Quirks”) It goes far to the point where he is even nicked named “Deku” for being useless. Although the initial story establishes Deku as a weakling, this changes after he meets All Might, a superhero who is famous in their world.
A general idea about the show is that Deku is constantly trying to prove himself and to others. Early episodes shows that he is fearlessly loyal to his friends and those he wishes to protect. This also includes Bakugo because Deku always wanted to surpass him after seeing how cool he is. Meanwhile, it’s evident that Deku has potential to become a powerful hero himself. All Might gives him the opportunity by letting Deku borrow his Quirk. After training and determination, Deku establishes himself as a newcomer to keep an eye on while Bakugo grows more jealous of his rival’s abilities. That’s also one of the interesting aspects of the show – the character relationships. Deku develops many relationships throughout the series. These include the rivalry between himself and Bakugo, the student-master relationship with All Might, and various friendships at school. Through these relationships, we see how Deku brings the best and worst out of characters. And believe me, there’s quite a lot of characters with their colorful personalities in this series.
With such a large cast, you may be asking yourself “how does the director plan to adapt this show?” Unfortunately, the series is structured to be a 1-cour with a mere 13 episodes. The ongoing manga has over 90 chapters while pacing of the adaptation seems slow. The plus side is that the “slow” also translates to faithfulness as every episode in the series is consistent and leaves nothing important out. As a fan of the manga, I’m proud to say that the series accurately does what it needed to do. I can’t speak for everyone though as the comedy can occasionally feel like a hit or miss for some fans. Although on a subjective level, it’s very popcornish humor that is there for some good fun. 
As for the character casting, the show does a neat job at characterizing most of them. Each of them has a different personality, a different Quirk, and unique persona that makes them individually talented. Some of the more prominent characters such as Iida, Uaraka, Todoroki all get their screen time that will be memorable for fans. In the meantime, it’s important to visualize that each character also has a reason to become a hero. So in retrospect, the characters aren’t there just to push Deku’s story but also have story themselves. The downside is that the characterization is condensed for this adaptation as result of the minimal episode figures.
It would also seem inevitable that the show is inspired by other genres and shounen jump works. The generic Exam Arc can be easily compared to series such as Naruto or Hunter x Hunter although with different styles. Meanwhile, there’s the whole underdog premise with the main character trying to make a name in their world. Still, the show is definitely fun to watch as it also seems to be inspired by American comic heroes. Popular series in North America such as The Flash, Arrow, etc all have heroes and there’s some resemblance that can be taken to account for this series. All Might stands out as the poster boy, Deku is the most prominent underdog, while Bakugo is portrayed as the hardcore antihero. And of course, we can’t forget about the villains either. In contrast to the heroic resemblance of the good guys, the villains are designed to look malevolent. The show does a nice job at introducing them without shoving them down the audience’s throats. Villains such as Stain and Kurogiri looks legitimately menacing. It also invites the anime only fans to wonder about their intentions, roles, and how powerful they really are. Because really, the show is literally saturated with all sorts of powers. You name it. We got super strength, explosive punches, gravity manipulation, superhuman flight, ice and fire control, invisibility, and even a girl who can use frog-like abilities. For a world with about 80% humans capable of using supernatural powers, it comes with a cool features.
Adapted by studio Bones, the show creatively designs its characters that matches a fair amount of consistency. Let’s face it, Kouhei Horikoshi is an underrated mangaka and his previous works weren’t considered major successes. Here, we got this show that has superheroes, action, and it just seems like every shounen fan’s wet dream. The character designs, while looks generic, is also creatively attractive. Every character has their own unique appearance and those who are heroes are equipped with a stylistic costume. I can’t say this enough but if there’s anything to remember this show, Boku no Hero Academia should definitely deserve some sort of reward of ‘Best Character Designs of the Year’. The action is well choreographed as well when you see punches landing or super powers connecting as how it should. Furthermore, character expressions brings out the best of personalities whether it’s fierce (Bakugo), Charming (Urakara), or heroic (All Might). Deku’s reactions are mostly comedic although when he gets hyped up, there’s a lot to keep an eye on as well. 
Ah Yuuki Hayashi. I was ecstatic after seeing his name appear as the music director as his work on Haikyuu!! Is nothing short of wonderful. Indeed, the music and soundtrack of the show is a solid demonstration of his talent in this show. It is crisp, intense, and cinematic all the same time. For a battle shounen series like this, it’s important to capture every important scene and the music delivered just that – making them relevant. The OP and ED theme songs are also creatively crafted with flamboyant choreography and style. Finally, praise should also be given to the voice acting especially for All Might and Bakugo as their character personalities really shines when you listen to their voice. 
So in the end, what should you expect from this show? There’s a lot and if you’re a big fan of battle shounen, then this will be a wonderful treat. From diverse character cast to the high dosage of superhero action, Boku no Hero Academia is a very fun show to watch. Despite my issue with the pacing, it is still consistent on most parts with the manga. With the announcement of the second season, there's still a lot of potential waiting to be explored. All in all, the show is recommendable to anyone. Whether you’re a new viewer getting into anime or a seasonal fan of shounen series, it’s a show that’s nothing short of exciting.",8,Stark700

                Overrated, childish, and cliche. Those are the first three words that come to mind when I think of this anime.
This is the most overrated anime that has came out in the past 5 years. After watching two seasons of this anime, I've come to the conclusion that this anime is absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities. I actually cant believe that people above the age of 15 can be watching this. It's actually crazy...This review might also contain spoilers. I cant fully explain how bad this show is without including spoilers unfortunately. This review will also not only be about season 1.
This is hands down
                  the most basic and generic shounen I've ever come across. The story is very stupid and cliche. The story is about a kid that wants to become a professional hero. It cant get anymore generic than that. So almost everyone in the world has quirks but Midoriya apparently doesn't. Ok. He then receives a quirk given to him by all might. That's just lame to be honest. I don't like how he just gets a quirk given to him. I'd rather see him training to get his own quirk. If anyone here is familiar with Black Clover, then you know how Asta got his own powers after training right? Even Black Clover did that better than My Hero Trashademia. How boring and uninteresting is it to see him just getting a power from someone else.
The plot is extremely repetitive. They go to school and have training sessions, random villains attack, fight villains, villains run or get defeated, and that's it. Now sometimes it's a bit different, but for the most part shits exactly the same. Nomus attack, League of Villains attack, it's just the same boring shit. In conclusion, the plot is fucking terrible. The only good thing is that the pacing is fast and I don't have to watch 10 episodes for 1 fight. That's literally the only good thing about this awful anime.
As I said earlier, this is the most basic and cliche shounen I've seen in a while. After finishing the first season I just thought, why the fuck are people hyping this up? It's literally the same thing as every other generic battle shounen we've had in the past 20 years. It does nothing different yet I see shounen fanboys everywhere sucking it off for what??
This anime easily has one of the worst cast of characters I've ever seen. The mangaka just tries to give ALL of them screen time it just doesn't work. In the end, barely any of them get character development at all. They're so bad I barely can even remember their names, even after two seasons of watching it. There's nothing interesting about the main characters either. There's nothing interesting about Bakugo. I don't know how anyone can like a character that screams 24/7 and gets absolutely no character development whatsoever. Midoriya has to be one of the most boring characters I've seen in a Shounen. His character development is just basic shounen character development. One second he's a pussy and the next he's extremely serious. It just makes no sense. As for Todoroki he's just a garbage Zuko rip off (but zukos actually a good character) with daddy issues. As I said before, this anime is extremely cliche and bad characters like this just prove it.
There's just too many irrelevant characters that get screen time for no reason. The only students that need a lot of screentime would be Midoriya, Bakugo, Uraraka, Momo, Frog, and Tokoyami. All these other characters shouldn't be getting screen time when they have little to none impact on the plot. If anyone here is familiar with Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, use that as an example. The writers for that anime tried to give too many characters screen time and it turned out to be a complete failure filled with underdeveloped characters. The same thing is happening with this anime.
This anime has the worst character designs I've seen in a Shounen. I honestly could not stand looking at these people. These characters just look so damn goofy and childish I felt like I was watching a childrens cartoon. Mineta, Alien looking girl, dude with the tape quirk. There's just way too many goofy looking characters to name them all. That's why this is the most childish anime I've ever watched. Not even joking. I've never seen an anime that looked goofier and more childish than this.
The music wasn't that great either. The only good opening is the first one. The endings are all pretty bad. There was only one memorable OST which played during fight scenes, and that got annoying real quick.
One good thing about this show is Stain. I think he's the only good villain in this entire show, all three seasons. But besides Stain, every other villain is complete and utter garbage! They're literally all just evil for the sake of being evil, especially that muscular guy. There's just no other interesting villains in My Hero Academia and that's fact. 
The fights in this anime are very underwhelming. All might vs One for All, one of the most disappointing fights I've seen in a shounen. Why should I care about this trash villain One for All when he has no depth whatsoever? He was just used to make all might look badass before his career as a hero ended. Todoroki vs Midoriya, once again another bad fight. The only good part of this fight was the end, that's it. Everything before that wasn't good at all. All the animation was put into the ending of the fight and anything before that was just talking or just boring to watch in general. Uraraka vs Bakugo, a fight that many My Hero fans were sucking off around the time it came out. I... I don't understand why people think this is that good? When it comes to actual fighting/choreography My Hero Academia fights are complete trash. 
In conclusion, this show is just awful and I don't suggest watching it. It's no different than any other generic battle Shounen anime you've watched. Bad characters, bad fights, bad plot, bad character designs, bad villains, bad everything. Don't watch this show.",1,Katanadude

                Hi there it's actually my first time writing a review. *I NEVER PLANNED TO WRITE ANY, BUT THIS IS A TRUE EXCEPTION*
If you are a fan of this, it would be in your best interests not to continue reading. 
Anyways bear with me. A sentence to summarize this whole show? ""the most overrated cliche shounen anime with ripped off ideas from a marvel movie forcefully jammed together with childish ideals""
The story.
I can go on and on about this it was absolutely dreadful and the most cringiest setting I have encountered.
A bland boy suddenly gets superpowers from a hero and starts training and fights for eons.
                  Amazing. It's repetitive like the filler stories of Naruto except it's all squeezed into a season.
The art.
Not bad really, colors were well done.
Sound
yeah classic booms and other normal sound effects. The theme songs were nice.
Character
Characters are well dictionary definitions. Please. There's a difference between exaggerated to definition characters. The main character is a textbook example of a one dimensional character with no background other than he was born without powers. ""I wanna be a hero!"" says he but all he ever does is write diary entries about current superheroes and does nothing to even train for it. He gets bullied and never fights back. As a survival instinct  you usually defend yourself to avoid damage and things get cringey. His academic skills aren't special too. Normal. Normal. Normal. Wait, to be fair underdog is a realistic opinion.
His childhood friend would then be the definition of emo. He hates poor ""does nothing but daydream"" kun and bullies him. I can understand, all he ever did when I watched the episodes was talk about his dreams but still, way too violent.
Others are poor representations of emotions and ideals like the movie inside out (inside out was good).
Enjoyment: No. Shounen for kids? Yes. Adults? Unless you really like this stuff no. No. No.
Overall: Just please no. It's an overrated anime that should be called more of a cartoon. I've heard some say this is better than SAO and I really must protest. Yes I acknowledge the issues like story skipping and such in SAO, but BNHA also has its issues with the whole classroom dynamic focusing on so many characters they start to become less important as the anime progresses, etc. I accept that no anime is going to be a perfect 10/10 for everyone and agree with the constructive criticism for such situations. BUT this is the most overrated, I repeat, overrated anime (ahem cartoon) I have ever seen. 
PS: looking back, I still feel the same way but would like to point out, as one user said, ""I'm not going to dislike someone because they liked something I didn't."" I hope you feel the same way that this user did. I'm not going to go around trying to argue my opinion on this show in front of avid fans. And yes, I am an SAO fanboy and I feel not-so-smart bringing up SAO on a totally different show.",1,MysticSquirrel

                In a world, where all of a sudden humanity has gained superpowers called Quirks… 
A world, in which almost all humans look like alien mutants and the crime rate has significantly increased… 
Where being a hero is considered a profession and Saitama definitely doesn’t exist…  There exists a boy who belongs to the minority that doesn’t have a superpower... 
The boy, called Izuku Midoriya, has a dream… He wants to be the mightiest hero of all, he wants to become the second ALL MIGHT!
The very young protagonist, despite having no Quirk, tries his very best to become one. But is that possible at all,
                  when the profession “hero” is all about being strong? And how could one possibly beat superhuman powers if you don’t have a special ability?
Boku no Hero Academia is set in a modern world where every single person wants to become a hero to save the useless people that don’t know what to do with their Quirks from the bad people who use their abilities to wreak havoc and be evil. Being a hero and become the focus of attention is way better than doing mundane things such as becoming a random office worker, right? 
This is where the first problem arises. How can society work if the 80% that have superpowers want to become a hero? And if, on top of that, not having a Quirk is being looked down upon; and doing everything that needs to be done to make everyday life function correctly is disregarded, why would these normal (or maybe abnormal) people even bother? You, the reader, must realize that there is no way the farmers will be able to produce enough food if their population decreases by 80%. Society can simply NOT function in the way this world is presented to us. But hey, since there is a superpower for anything, this might just be miraculously solved!
With that out of the way, I’ll start talking about the main plot. The main character Midorima, in his eagerness to become a hero, takes notes on every hero he sees and looks how they fight against villains. But since he himself has no Quirk, it is very hard for him to become a hero. This is also why many other kids in his class look down on him, making his life more miserable. On top of that, his “childhood friend”, who is constantly bullying him, makes him realize all the more that it would be an impossible task for a quirkless person. 
It seems like his quest for becoming a hero will certainly fail, when he has a fateful encounter with an emaciated geezer that always coughs up blood. This encounter proves to change his life radically, because Deus ex Machina is overwhelmingly overpowered and seems to be able to solve any problem without much effort. Well, maybe not exactly without much effort, but certainly it is a half-assed way to solve things. This is when he sees a light at the end of the endless darkness. HOPE! He can maybe become a hero!
The next section I will discuss is characters. Although the cast of character is certainly not huge, being most of them sidekick heroes or unimportant hero students, there are four important characters in this show.
The protagonist, Izuki Midoriya, is a young boy that at the beginning of the show hasn’t entered high school yet. During his whole life he aimed to be a hero, but it seemed as though his Quirk never wanted to appear. Despite that, he continually worked hard to become one through studying alone. He obviously will succeed, as he is the protagonist. That aside, this character seems to evolve slightly, going from a total coward to someone that dares to speak up (a bit). Although he isn’t a total retard, his personality is still the same as most shounen protagonists.
The second main character, Bakugou, is supposed to be Izuki’s childhood friend, which completely baffled me, as this character is constantly bullying the protagonist bcuz eevil is gud and is objectively superior since he has a nice “bang”. It’s also rather annoying that he underwent a sudden character change; all of a sudden he is a “good” guy, and the reason to it is rather stupid.
Another character introduced to us is the emaciated geezer, who is something like a mentor to Midoriya. He is the responsible for making it possible for the protagonist to become a hero and has an interesting story which I won’t tell because spoilers. Nevertheless, I really doubt his choice-making ability, as Midoriya doesn’t seem that special to me.
The only female lead is a girl called Ochako, whom Izuki met in the hero entrance exam and seems to be nice to Izuki, without any reason. She is a dimensionless character who doesn’t really add anything to the show.
Thus concludes the characters section and starts another one; sound and animation.
	As for the sound, the music played throughout the different scenes was satisfying; there was no mismatch between music and type of scene. The used soundtracks were well used and could be considered good. Furthermore, the voice actors played their role well and managed to match the personalities of the characters with their voices. The opening and ending themes were shit as with nearly all shows, and nothing anyone says can change this particular opinion of mine. Overall nothing special in this regard, only what is required to not make it disturbing.
	The animation used in this show was good enough; background was well done (though it had no movement) and the moving parts were drawn well. Battle animations were fluid and special effects also transmitted all the information that was needed easily observe what is happening.
Finally, I’ll discuss enjoyment and make a small summary of the show.
	Surprisingly, this show managed to be enjoyable for me, for about 3 episodes. This is where the whole idea started to become too stereotypical and predictable, making me start to dislike it. As the show progressed, everything became more and more predictable; and thus more boring. All the Deus ex Machina didn’t really help my enjoyment of the show either, contributing to the low score I gave to this section.
	In essence, heroes are gud and villains are bad; small children must go into a hero academia to beat eevil. Even though there are some terrible people amongst these heroes. 
Do I recommend Boku no Hero Academia? No, I don’t think watching this is worth the time for people who actually think about what is happening in an anime while watching, because the amount of plot holes and inconsistencies is too big. For those who prefer to just enjoy a show and not think about it (or those that are new to anime), I do believe that it is worth watching, though.
If you read through all of this, I applaud you. Furthermore I would like to add that feedback is appreciated.",5,Ksuga

                Boku no hero academia or My hero academia was one of the most hyped anime series of spring 2016 and in my opinion it lived up to the hype.
My biggest disappointment was the episode count being only 13 but that was to be expected as Bones rarely does 25 episode anime. However a season 2 has been announced and if they continue to follow the manga season 2 will be even better.
Story: 8/10
The story is not that original but all the characters quirks make the story interesting enough.
Art: 9/10
The art and animation for Boku no hero academia is great for the most is great, there
                  is a few scenes near the end were the animation is not that great but it is very good for the most part. 
Sound: 9//10
I love the soundtrack it fit the series perfectly. The opening is fine  but I thought it would be better, the ending theme is great though.
Character: 9/10
The characters are all unique the only reason it does not get a ten is because their are too many characters and not enough time. The character that were introduced were great.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed Boku no hero academia so much it was my favourite of Spring 2016. Not only was it my favourite of Spring 2016 it is only in my top 5 anime of all time.
Overall: 9/10
Overall Boku no hero academia was great. It was slow paced and needed more episodes but I still enjoyed it. Just after the villains arc ( the one the anime ended on) the manga gets way better so I'm very hyped for season 2. I highly recommend My hero academia so everyone. Evan if you thought season 1 was just okay I think you should watch season 2 when I comes out it will be way better.
Watch it on Funimation or buy the blu rays when the come out. Illegally streaming is killing the anime industry. 
Thanks for reading my review, It was my first one so it might not be that great.",9,Dillon18-07

                For the spring 2016 Anime lineup, Boku no Hero Academia was considered as the main shounen title of the season, and for good reason. It had everything going for it that you’d need in a good shounen and was something that could easily be picked up by anyone at any time. But the real thing to consider here is, even though it managed to stand as a good show to watch overall, was it truly able to Go Beyond (Plus Ultra!!) any of what the genre has set as its standard?
Story:
For the most part, the story doesn’t really have much to talk about. Well, at
                  least not yet. The show, like most others in the shounen genre seems to be of a rather extensive nature and considering the length of Academia, it’s pretty understandable that they could only give us a small part of the story with just 13 episodes, thus leaving us with a plot that does leave behind a few hints of a deeper subject and some greater events to come but unfortunately also leaves the show in a rather incomplete and unsatisfying note. So we’re not really getting any closure until maybe another season.
But let’s talk about the actual contents. First off, while the concept is nothing new and has been done several times before, the show still manages to present it in a very ‘fun’ way. It maintains a very nice atmosphere and is able to carry out events in a manner that is very easy to digest and do not require much thinking to enjoy. While the story doesn’t offer anything all that amazing and is rather linear, it is still enjoyable. One other thing that I particularly liked about the show is that it is very honest with itself. It knows exactly what it is and doesn’t try too hard to be something that it’s not. This way, everything always feels in place and none of the scenarios feel overdone or unfitting.
Sadly, even with all that, the show still did feel as if it was constantly missing something, like it just didn’t have enough. Though I did say that I appreciated the fact that it doesn’t try to be something it’s not, it also doesn’t try to ever improve or explore upon the aspects that do relate to it. It feels confined to a certain space which doesn’t leave much room for diversity, thus lacking anything for the viewer to truly look forward to. Simply put, it’s a very simple show with a simple setup.
Art and Animation:
Academia offers a simple and comic-like style of art. It might not have all that much detail, but it does hold a certain charm to it and is pleasing to look at. The character designs are also done nicely, again not much detail and are kept simple but that’s what allows it to fit with the theme to a good extent. The animation did feel a bit clunky at times but was fairly smooth when it needed to be, such as during the action sequences which were always animated well enough.
Sound:
The soundtrack is one of the better aspects of Academia. I always found the OST to be catchy and it always set the atmosphere for the show really well. Coupled with its style of presentation, it managed to set the mood for certain situations and even got me excited during some of it. The voice acting’s also done well, but still not something I would praise.
The opening sequence was well presented and did prove to be a good way to start the show, but eventually starts to lose its charm after a few episodes. After about 4 to 5 episodes, I found myself skipping through it at the start of each one..
Characters:
While the characters do have some very interesting designs and fun personalities, there’s hardly anything redeemable about any of them. Most characters within the show are very flat, they’re exactly what’s given to you at face value. There’s no depth to them and most of them are very stereotypical. The main character himself follows a very generic underdog personality and development which can pretty much be seen anywhere within the shounen genre. There isn’t anything wrong with sticking to the norm, but to not add your own uniqueness to it kind of is. Because of which, most of the cast just ends up feeling like a copy-paste of other shounen stereotypes. While the characters do have their own quirky personalities and are fun in their own way, they don’t have anything to offer much beyond that, and eventually end up feeling rather plain and forgettable.
Presentation:
This is the aspect which pretty much saves Academia from falling to a bad grade. Despite all the shortcomings, it still manages to be an entertaining show. It just offers a very lively feel and really puts you in the mood. Getting to experience all the different abilities and quirks that the many characters had, proved to be a rather enjoyable experience for me and the way these quirks are used during the battle sequences was also very nice. It gave off a sense of creativity. The way the show carries out its development and how it’s all presented allowed me to enjoy the show for what it offered without paying too much mind to the many problems that it already had. Thus allowing me to even forget about those problems sometimes.
Conclusion and Verdict:
While Academia might not have been able to offer anything above the usual, it still fulfilled its job as a fun shounen. If you’re looking for a nice little show to watch that doesn’t take too much thinking or just want to enjoy something that’s quick while giving out enough enjoyment to make you want to watch more, then Academia could tend to your needs quite well. But for those who’ve already seen enough of the genre and are looking for something new to be had, then your time is better spent elsewhere.",5,Genjutsuhh

                As i see season 2 of this anime is very good ranked i wanted to try it. People say its a original and refresing shounen but they are all wrong.
Story: The world they live in everyone has superpowers, but the mc dont so he is useless. But even tho he is useless the best hero gives him his power for no reason instead of giving it to someone more op. I mean think about it, if you could choose to give superpowers to a useless guy or guy that make explosions what would you choose??
Art: The art is only good with this anime
Sound: Sound is
                  okay
Characters: This is the worst part of all, the characters is so cliche. Its like copy paste from all other shounen. All male characters are boring and cringe. And no good waifus for female characters, just boring.
Enjoyment: I only give this anime a 3 cause of cliches. And it only makes it worse when all might is copy from saitama in one punch man.",3,xSugoizZz
31964,"
                Story 4: My Hero Academia is a story about superheroes learning at an academia. Except it isn't. It starts that way, but it isn't that way. Deku works so hard just to go to a school we don't get to pay attention to. People say it is just a typical shounen, but a typical shounen would have tried to flesh out the school life a little. When you have such a unique school setting for once, you decide to just blow it. It's so stupid. The story is very, very character focused and overly convenient. You go from entrance exams to showing off a really
                  powerful set of villains and how the fledgling heroes act in a crisis almost immediately, right when we were just feeling like it would possibly be a more developed world. 
Art 9: There are a ton of character designs, which is amazing to me. There are some exceptionally cute character designs, which is not something that I have said about any anime before. It also doesn't shy away from mixing big muscle and a slightly more Western style with the typical skinny young anime heroes aesthetic. There is nothing really lacking, but it isn't artistic enough to warrant a 10.
Sound 8: I don't remember much of the sound, but I have a feeling the soundtrack isn't a weak point. I'm not at all a fan of the opening theme, but the ending isn't too bad. Usually I don't factor in openings or endings into the sound department too much though since they aren't made by the team behind the anime usually.
Character 6: Characters SHOULD be higher, but I still feel like the only ones they really care about are the biggest protagonists. Even with trying to give a lot of characters  a little time to develop, it is done in such unnatural form that it doesn't feel nice. The only exception in this arc was Iida, who really got to show what they were like at heart. All Might is annoying character. While it might seem deep to give such a strong character a weakness, it just feels like an excuse for weak writing and a reason to have a slightly unnecessary tutor character like in Naruto or Reborn!. Yes it may have been the start of the story and a central plot point, but it doesn't work well in the long run and All Might basically just proves that the time limit he placed on himself might mean nothing at all, which makes things feel extra fake. Maybe once the injury is explained, we can understand his reasoning because i don't get why it would hinder him so much.
The main character Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is really a solid shounen protagonist since he is truly thoughtful, studious and passionate and gets to where he is at the beginning by pure hard work. But how his power develops is very, very shaky because we don't get to see him train the power directly. His rival is very well presented, has a great character design and you can really feel that he has deeper motivations in everything that will probably develop further even if other developments were dropped.
One character I absolutely hated was that baby. There is no reason why he exists. His personality is bad and quirk is useless so it doesn't make sense that he got into the Academy with the highest standards. Additionally, Sui's reaction to him is terrible.
Enjoyment 3: I was able to watch 26 episodes of Hero Academia, which is more than I can say for basically all of the few anime I get around to trying. But that may have just been because I was curious about the world since I was in an RP discord server and wondering what made the world stand out. Still, I was not excited past the first two episodes. There wasn't too much that caught my attention after they got to the exams and school, except Deku's rivalry and showing off new character skills, which is just too flat for me. There was also the feeling that the plot wasn't properly explored at all by skipping to a major fight so quickly in place of what could have been a very interesting event (learning how to rescue people in natural disasters or something like that).",4,Jhale

                	Seeing the hype of My Hero Academia, I have the general impression that people watch it with the mindset as just another enjoyable fighting shounen with a unique-looking superhero premise. The production values are decent, the atmosphere is fitting for the superhero premise, and the story of a Quirkless individual really gives off that empowerment vibes. However, I like to try to dig beneath the surface. This review is mainly focused on the premise of the show and how it’s possibly flawed upon closer inspection. 
	First, we get a setting where having superpowers is a normality. How come heroism still thrives in this kind of
                  setting? Factors such as the existence of Quirkless people, powers being inferior to others, and the inevitable division between bad and evil are all reasons why. Yet, these reasons could have been used more properly to have a better story in terms of conflict and exploration. The existence of Quirkless people serves as a way for discrimination to thrive into the story, without having any pre-existing remedies to compensate for their absence of Quirks. Inferior powers are also a way for discrimination to be present in the story, but powers could be used in other aspects of life apart from fighting like industry and transportation. The division between bad and good hasn’t been properly explained by the story so far but the impression I get is that it’s biased on one side (Justice always wins). I’m hoping the second season will try to expand on this aspect. 
	Second, the story takes place in an academy for aspiring heroes. Does it really need to be necessary to enroll in an academy to be qualified a hero? Apart from the main cast being kids which means there must be a sort of school, there is no real reason. There is an organization of heroes in general but having an academy that is modelled after an ordinary school with stuff like English class feel pointless. Powers varies by person and you can’t simply measure their capability through a set of tests following a common guideline. Sure, you can polish things like preparedness, mentality, and utilization of powers but they mostly lie on the theoretical side. How will they train their powers if there is no such thing as an academy? Things such as self-training or discipleship work.  Based from what I observed, the main drive for the cast is to have their powers recognized by the crowd and not the noble idea of helping others unconditionally like All Might does. The original meaning of heroism gets twisted. It can make an interesting deconstruction but it doesn’t look that way based on what we are shown thus far.
	The story is fairly average as a shounen title but with the attention-grabbing superhero premise. The main cast are not really that interesting and lack the charm to be an interesting hero. They could use better characterization to look less generic and more character background to reinforce their standing and future development as a character in the story. Overall, it has an interesting premise but it’s not being fully utilized by the story. It has a strong start, but it starts to lose steam as it side-tracks into the less interesting parts of the story. The enjoyment is there, with a couple of frustrations along the way, but it could have used its episodes better. But hey, we still have another season and just maybe it might resolve some of the problems I have in the show. For now, it’s just fine as a mindless yet enjoyable and engaging superhero story but not really as amazing as I expected it to be.",6,BlueKite

                My Hero Academia was easily the most hyped show this season for me, and for good reason. Once I heard that it was going to be produced by Bones, my anticipation went through the roof because of the obligatory Full Metal Alchemist comparisons. What I got was not FMA, nor should it have been. My Hero Academia is an endearing and uplifting tale of a young boy trying to get accepted into an academy full of individuals with superpowers (which he ironically has none of). It's almost like an anime based on Xmen. It ends up suffering a tad from groundhogs day disease and plot
                  conveniences, and the overall premise wasn't exactly what I originally foresaw. However, a great potential and the last three episodes certainly made the series for me, giving me something to look forward to in the newly announced season two.
There's that popular saying in life that everything is good in moderation, and I found that that's one of the areas that Academia struggles.  The first episode was rather enjoyable and I really felt moved and gripped by Midoriya's motivating personality.  The way he admired the other heroes and envied their ability to save those in need struck some heart chords with me that I really can't explain. A lot of shows start off with this underwhelmingly weak protagonist but something about Midoriya seemed more relatable. In a way he kind of reminded me of myself because of his brains over brawn mentality, even if it is was technically forced upon him due to natural selection. Unfortunately, the ""I can do it!"" theme from the first episode repeated a multitude of times afterwards. It almost felt as though I was watching the same episode over and over again with a different background. This was the point in the show when I realized how lofty my expectations may have initially been.
I chuckled at the convenient nature in which Midoriya receives his perk. I guess in his case persistence really does pay off. All Might almost appeared to be swatting away a fly when he was initially dismissive of Midoriya. Convenience aside, I was relieved to see that the power given to him was not magically mastered in a minute. Perseverance and willpower were the keys to making this perk work. Using this new power Midoriya grows tremendously as a character. Through this growth he even inadvertently manages to spark a sense of jealousy in his rival Kacchan's eyes.  toll that the All Might ability had on his body was proof of its potency. The manner in which Midoriya's fellow students revered him after saving Uraraka was a prime example of the naivety of youth. The other adults teaching the classes knew something was up, but his peers change their minds rather quickly when they saw the impact of his perk. I'm just glad an anime writer finally illustrated how gullible kids can be vice making them into a reincarnated Sherlock Holmes in the form of a 14-year-old. I appreciated the sense of realism written into the characters which was shown quite well in the evacuation scene, where mass chaos ensued when the threat of a security breach within the school loomed.
Another aspect of Academia I enjoyed was the comedy. Sometimes anime can entirely derail due to poorly written comedy. Unintentionally deadpan humor that falls on deaf ears can be cringe worthy. There were even shows this season guilty of such atrocities in dialogue. Academia's jokes were well written, subtle and well-placed within its 13 jampacked episodes. I even found myself laughing out loud during a couple of instances. Something about Midoriya's character is so pathetic you can't help but laugh at him from time to time.  At the same token, the story can have very uplifting moments, and the tides can turn quite quickly into serious, cerebral battles. Pacing can be a slight issue due to the development of the characters, environment and plot. With the potential to be a repeating series, at times Academia struggled to keep me focused due to the sheer amount of things it was trying to get done in such a short amount of episodes. Despite this and the aforementioned groundhog effect, Academia kept me entertained and intrigued enough to look forward to its second installment in order to expand the story.  I was also elated to see how the show ended, another aspect that made me look forward to future seasons. The series took a dark turn in the concluding episodes, showing the heroes in a vulnerable state, something not shown in many anime/television shows. You can really feel the panic in Midoriya and his friend's voices, realizing that being a hero isn't all about glory and morality... There can be quite a grim side as well.
Obviously the character development in Academia primarily revolves around our main protagonist Midoriya. I can be slightly empathetic to his childhood as I also got made fun of and ridiculed for my shortcomings when I was younger. I do like the approach the writers gave to Midoriya's backstory, making it seem like a tale of redemption more than a sob story. Although meek and timid l, Midoriya shows promise as a MC from his determination and intellect. Although his goals are lofty, he is still just a boy who is shy and nervous around girls, and gets worked up over relatively trivial matters. His interactions with Kacchan are very believable in the sense that he sees himself at level ground once his perk is obtained. His rival, someone that he's looked up to and envied for his entire life has now been knocked down a peg and has become vulnerable. The Herculean growth he goes through in the series is awe-inspiring. Kacchan doesn't necessarily receive the same amount of growth or character development, but he isn't entirely ignored. His past is slightly explored through character flashbacks and some inner monolguing, but it didn't quite cut the mustard for me. I wanted to know more about what made his mind works the way it did and why he was always so pissed off at Midoriya. I felt like there was a lot more emotion possibly smokescreened beneath it all. 
Besides Kacchan and Midoriya, the only other character worthy of any development was All Might. His facade he showcased in hero form was taking a massive toll on his body.  Passing the torch was inevitable, but he struggled internally with doing so.  I think he may have been my favorite character in the whole series. There was just a brute sense of realism in his actions. I know that this character development problem stems from the fact that the series is only 13 episodes but that doesn't make it not a problem. I know that risk and budgeting issues limit most anime seasons from being longer than about a dozen episodes, but it doesn't give me a real chance to become connected to a cast the size of a show like Academia. I couldn't even remember half of their names when the show is over. I know this isn't a problem directly linked to Academia, but it's frustrating nonetheless. The villain who appeared at the end showed some promise so, I guess I'll have to wait till next season to see his character more developed.
There is no denying that the music and art in Academia are top notch and I would expect nothing less from bones. The opening is one of my favorites this season, with its quick beat and intense animation. I actually found it on a 10 hour loop within a couple days of its premiere on YouTube. There are no miss use of sound effects or bad voice acting. Both Midoriya and All Might's voice actors put on tremendous shows of versatility in their roles. The ED's a cute little childish bow on each episode as if to remind you that you're watching a cartoon, in case you forgot. Nothing really special here. I really like the art style in academia, everything looked fluid and seamless... and its budget was on display here.  Beautiful fight scenes galore, it was certainly visually stimulating. I thought it was interesting how both shows produced by Bones this season (Academia and Bunguo Stray Dogs) each had such vivid and discernible art styles.
My Hero Academia was no FMAB reincarnation, but was easily entertaining in its own right.  Through its use of eye-catching visuals and inspirational story, there is something for everyone in this series.  I am anxiously awaiting the second season to discover what happens to Midoriya and his friends at the Hero Academy.  I guess only time will tell how great of a franchise this becomes, but I would recommend it to anyone.  If you're looking for some quality action and entertainment without too much strain on the intellectual side, this is an anime for you.

                I've come across a few anime of this genre, and I can't rack my brains around how they so consistently amass a large following. Whether the premise is confined to a school; the world; a personal journey; a collective journey; comedy; harem or on a more serious tone. Maybe the recently sensationalised marvel universe has enchanted the masses into submission. 
Boku no Hero Academia seems to touch on a few of the above mentioned bases without the core themes being disjointed on paper. The problem however, is that the ultimate relay is a lukewarm exploration into topics it clearly took a more juvenile approach to
                  and ultimately finds its themes disjointed. Which is why I'd  say this is for the younger audience, as I can't imagine this being taken seriously by an older demographic. 
Boku no Hero Academia is about a world where 80% of the population is born with quirks, or in other words, some 'super power'. One of the problems I had right away is with the properties of these powers - they were mostly just painfully juvenile and often times lacked any practicality in more or less any scenario. This problem is inevitable if you are going to build a premise of a barrage of characters having said powers. This would have been OKAY if not for the fact that EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A HERO. What's worse, more or less, THEY ARE. To enjoy anime is to often times suspend disbelief, but when you are presented with characters that have lame heroes with powers like climbing walls or shooting balls of goo, it is hard to take seriously. More or less, the majority of other characters also have abilities that any pistol would outdo from a militaristic standpoint. This would have been OKAY if the anime was mostly confined to a comedy genre, but it ISN'T - it tries to take a serious tone with melodramatic and black and white depictions of good and evil.
Which brings me to the other problem; characters. Alot of characters, but few backgrounds explored. And the ones explored are as what you'd expect if you notice the rest of the show - childish. The MC is a pansy kiss ass without any resolve beyond the shows projected fight for its black and white justice.He always wanted to be a hero despite not being born with a quirk and now conveniently has one, thus fulfilling his dream. That's the sum of his character.  The blonde haired secondary (forget his name), has probably the worst background to date in anime - he hates the MC despite being friends in the past because the MC asked if he was okay after an accident that had nothing to do with the MC, and now this terrible secondary vows vengeance against him throughout the series. One of the worst narratives I've come across. The rest of the characters are also the lame righteous knights without faults for the most part, and as mentioned, don't have much backgrounds explored, and their overall personalities are just a lot of ''I want to be a hero'', to be well, a hero. No backgrounds beyond that for the most part. 
The villains were as you would also expect, the other polar end of the good and evil spectrum. The main antagonist pushes to upset the balance of peace for the sake of destruction and fame. Full stop. Moving on. The only one villain in the show that has any character is 'Hero Killer Stain', whom has an agreeable philosophy to mine - ''there are too many heroes''. The rest of the antagonists seem to just be an extension to the main antagonist with their viewpoints aligned. No individuality to comment on. This union is structurally symmetrical to the hero's society. Bleh. 
Story :
The story is just a function of the above mentioned character design. Light vs Dark. Good vs Evil. Beyond the plot, the combat is mildly enjoyable if you can move past the question of practicality,as it is actually rather well choreographed. Beyond this, the actual concepts of their abilities were a bit too juvenile for my taste. They tried to incorporate a strategic front to the combat, but it was often times a little too simplistic or unreasonable even within their own framework. The absence of death or gore to boot only made the show lack suspense.  Again, no problem with that, but I find it more for a younger audience. 
The art is one thing I can't criticise at all.
 Ultimately, I did manage to get through the show without too much struggle, but it's more of a show to simply pass the time rather than take something with you. Put it on the bucket list if a fun combat oriented anime is for you, but probably place it on the lower end.",5,deathlytivo

                First thing I  just feel the need to say, everyone who is saying this is like One Punch Man... sorry but THAT IS ABSOLUTE BS. Beyond the fact that they're both series with heroes and superpowers and that the character designs are are a little funky/quirky (haha pun intended), there is NOTHING SIMILAR. That's like saying Death Note and Bleach are similar series since they happen to both focus on shinigami as a supernatural element in a previously seemingly normal world and both MC are high schoolers. Bleh. No. Just no. Just needed to get that off my chest, since I feel like people
                  might watch this with the expectation that it's like One Punch Man, or might not watch it because they think it will be like it. It's not.
Since I'm late to the party in watching this, rather than give yet another description of the plot like all the other reviews before mine, I'm just gonna say it straight:
This show suffers from a SERIOUS pacing issue. Every single episode, from the first to the last, feels like a forth to a half is filler. The story is dragged out beyond being dragged out. It doesn't work because for this first arc of the story, the plot is very simple and predictable and follows a typical shounen genre type plot with magical schools/superpowers we've seen dozens and dozens of times beforehand.
You can literally fast forward through a lot of it, and the characters will be doing the exact same exercise/dialogue topic/training, whatever, as minutes prior. And it's not complicated stuff, there's no amazing fight scenes or complex plot points to warrant such drawn out scenarios. Basically, it actually gets boring.
I'm being repetitive, but it's just truthful, you can't drag out a show with such a simple story line. I feel like what happened in 13 episodes could have happened easily in half the time, and it still might have felt a little dragged out.
I actually ended up reading the manga after, because I really like the whole superpower/magical school genre, (and it's rare to find one without the females being stupidly cliche weak/annoying idiots or overly sexualized characters only being placed for fan service. Kudos to the author for that.) The manga is bounds and leaps better than the anime, and after reading it I can see WHY people rate this show so highly. If you're a fan of the manga, seeing the characters you like come to life, and knowing the cool storyline that unfolds afterwards, is really awesome and exciting. But as an anime on it's own, if you're not already a fan, it's just alright.
The show gives off that same feel that Naruto filler episodes do: the creators are trying to milk it for everything it's worth to make as much money as possible. I don't blame them, since it's a business, but it could've been an amazing show. As it is, it's just sort of good. I wouldn't be disappointed if it's discontinued, but I would still be sort of interested to see if it gets better in the next season, giving how well I like the manga. That sort of feel.
To sum it up,  to just rate this show based on its merits as a stand alone anime, it barely receives a passing grade.",6,morphinup

                *ATTENTION*
Do I have your attention now?...hehe
Boku no Hero Academia is not like your every shounen anime. This (and One punch man) is kind of ""shounen gone american"" version, like the concept of superhero society spreading around which is(and I mean it) certainly not a bad thing. We all watch things for something new but once in a while who doesn't like combos (here bit american-japanese).
Izuku Midoriya is your nerd with hell-lot of bravery who wants to become a hero no matter what. SO it's the story of the journey of this boy from being a zero to some ass-kicking-badass-'all-might'y hero......
The universe of My hero Academica
                  is where everybody(almost) have some kind of power or quirk (in anime's terms), now according to their powers they become either heroes or live normally. Now Izuku (I think u already know) is our powerless but passionate wannabe hero, the emotions, the feelings that he carries are one of the +points and is beautifully portrayed. Every hero story needs a rival either in a form of enemy or friend-now here we have Bakugou who is one arrogant prick but yet overwhelmingly powerful, he my friends makes a great rival who is standing on the brink of the pit of evil held by Izuku from the other end. No matter which universe we go we all stay human, hence it is yet another saga of struggle against the odds. Ofcourse (you know) there is also an evil organisation at work who like any other one believes in extermination of all heroes and bring darkness, so what their plan is..>.>(don't worry not tellin) but they still have a big plan they need to execute...so now our Hero Academica will try and stop them..
So let the game begin... 
Art/Animation-9/10
Animation is not 'WoW' but it is good, somewhat like in every other anime, it's pleasant to watch.
Music/Sound/Voice Actors-9/10
Music is good...OP is ""The Day"" by Porno Graffitti and ED is""HEROES"" by Brian the Sun....Background music in important and fighting scene is badass,cool...Voice actors are good..I personally quite like Urakawa's voice done by Ayane sakane (She's super cute ...(~ ~))
Characters-8/10
Izuku is good earnest hero, Bakugou is your 'almost evil'-hero, Todoroki is your 'all powerful yet in pain' hero and many more interesting ones.I've read it's manga first and I think you can see a character more truthfully in it's original form, so what I can say is that the character don't have that much depth (but anyway when did shounen heroes had any depth...ლ(o◡oლ)﻿﻿) but still they do the task. 
Anyway it's a show with a great potential as Masashi Kishimoto said. I personally think it's a must watch as for seeing the sort-of changing trends in anime industry.

                Boku no overrated is a more accurate title considering that children and adults everywhere gush over this dumpster fire despite it not being any better than Naruto or bleach.
The story is pretty much the story of Naruto. You follow this friendless wimpy little brat that can't fight but wants to become the most powerful fighter in their place of residence. And they don't really make any meaningful jump in power until they meet an overpowered old man (Hokaga = super hero. Toad sage= allmight) But that's where the similarities end. Unlike midoriya, Naruto worked for the shit he got and when he failed he tried
                  again that made him endearing... 
 Midoriya just cried for an episode or two until someone handed him powers.
what I'm  trying to say is midoriya is one of the many things that ruined this anime for me. He's an entitled brat that any sensible person would want to smack in the face immediately after getting to know them.
Another problem with the anime is the quirk system...It's close to the devil fruit abilities  in one piece but it's shit. Every character has a unique ability in Hero Academia but none of them are fixable. While devil fruit had a high level of adaptability quirks do not. The second you know someones power they'll never gonna have any other tricks up their sleeves. Because of this  Most fights are well animated but boring.
The characters are all one dimensional and forgettable. Aside from 1 or 3 of them.
I hated this anime but I can see the appeal of it.

                My Hero Academia is regularly billed as ""The New One Piece"" or ""The New Naruto"". There's certainly some truth to that - even setting aside meta comparisons like its status as Jump's new cash cow, it clearly draws inspiration from both, with its distinctive cartoony character designs and action scenes owing much to One Piece, and its school setting and ensemble cast resembling early Naruto.
But the important thing is what's new.
It'd be easy to dismiss Hero Academia as another soulless clone of its predecessors (and there really are so many), but in some respects HeroAca marks a progression from usual genre conventions. The first and
                  foremost example of this is in the protagonist, Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya.
One of the biggest and most frequent problems with battle shonen protagonists is in the origin of their powers. Goku, Naruto, Ichigo, Yusuke, and many other such protagonists are all born special. The growth of these characters and their abilities ultimately breaks down to unlocking a series of contrived powerups.
Deku, however, is born powerless (which in the setting of HeroAca is quite unique). But as he idolizes heroes - especially All Might, who is considered the world's greatest hero - he devotes his life to the study of heroes' abilities. Perhaps because of this, Deku develops the virtues key to being a great hero, is recognized for this by All Might himself, and is granted powers of his own.
This is one of Hero Academia's strengths - there's an emphasis placed, not just on becoming the strongest hero, but on becoming the *greatest* hero. On what it means to be heroic. HeroAca is a series about character growth, but it's about their growth as people as much as their growth in skill.
The battle system also benefits from this, as their powers (or ""Quirks"" are they are known) are always simply what they are. While Deku's increasing ability is a core part of the plot, the roof on his power level is set from day 1. His progression is only him learning to use it. This keeps the series grounded, ensuring it doesn't devolve into a string of powerups. Better still, every step taken to gain control of his abilities is logical and earned - there's no deus ex machina at work here.
That we're able to empathize with each step of his journey keeps us invested in Deku, which is the core of why this series works. The contrast of virtues also makes for an interesting and colourful supporting cast. each with their own reasons for becoming heroes. This is helped by some exceptionally distinct character designs courtesy of mangaka Horikoshi Kouhei's unique sense of style and aesthetic. There's no mistaking HeroAca for any other anime.
However, while all this applies to Hero Academia as a series, both to the manga and later instalments of the anime, to speak solely of this particular season of the anime, it suffers from being a 13-episode season. Not only is this season absurdly slow-paced compared to the source material (most likely as an attempt to neatly end with a complete story arc), but it ultimately leads to a lack of actual content. As a result, there are alarmingly few hot-blooded beat-the-shit-out-of-each-other fight scenes, considering that these are practically mandatory for this genre.
At the end of the day, My Hero Academia is a prelude for things to come. It's the beginning of a long story. The first act. It's a very solid foundation to build a great series on, but that is all it is - a foundation. HeroAca is definitely a good show and worth watching, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.

                So like, I watched 300 episodes of Naruto, so that makes me some expert on shounen anime. Thing is, this is a good genre, but a lot of titles have too much bullshit. Corny backstories, cheap asspulls, ridiculous powers thinking that bigger=better; there are certainly good shounen, but a lot of them just come off as trying too hard. But Boku no Pico Academia doesn’t step outside of anyone’s comfort zone while it embraces the genre; it’s a love letter to those who grew up thinking superheroes were fucking cool (which they are), and for those who still enjoy a traditional feel-good underdog story, all
                  without stepping outside of its boundaries.
To anyone with a soul, the beginning of Izuku Midoriya’s story is easy to understand. He grows up admiring the number one hero, Saitaaaaa...ll Might, and wants nothing more than to be a badass superhero like him, until he soon learns that he simply lacks the genes to do so. Yet, he continues to follow his dream and tries to become some sort of analyst or something, perhaps being a hero with knowledge. Gotta respect someone with determination like this.
One thing leads to another, and eventually Izuku really does end up with a great power, and starts his journey to become the greatest hero ever. But he doesn’t get this power through a sheer amount of luck or through bloodlines, he actually earns it through hard, daunting work. 
Without a corny, exaggeratedly tragic backstory, or a free super-overpowered ability, we get a typical shounen hero, one that’s very believable and respectable. Izuku Midoriya isn’t really an interesting character, but the basics of him are absolutely perfect.
The one thing that is exaggerated a bit is the rivalry between Izuku and his childhood rival, Gary Oa--oh, sorry. I mean Bakuman, that’s his name. There’s nothing wrong with the rivalry, it’s just a standard “hey this guy’s better than me, I wanna beat him!” versus “HAHAHAHA SCRUB I’M AWESOME GET GOOD SMELL YOU THE FUCK LATER”, but the anime furiously hypes this rivalry up to the point where it’s obvious that the they’re buying time so the episode can fill twenty-four minutes. Like… I get it. Just fucking punch the guy, already. 
Flashbacks, a common shounen trait, are used pretty commonly in general, but they didn’t bother me nearly as much as this one episode did. If anything, they go along with the show’s slow pacing to add some real impact to the show’s big HYPE!!! moments, which are extremely satisfying. This plays into Izuku’s power, which is some sort of super-strength, but using it will essentially crush the body part it’s used from. This means that not only is it severely limited, but using it involves making a clear, conscious decision, leading to each attack being a huge, swift moment with a lot of build-up.
So I guess it’s kind of an orgasm, have fun thinking about that from now on.
But the biggest moments for me were those involving All Might, the #1 hero and almighty (heh) symbol of justice. In a tale all about superheroes and learning how to become one, it’s good to have a character that embodies the role perfectly. He’s the strongest, he’s the nicest, and he doesn’t afraid of anything. His relationship with Izuku is a charming one (no homo tho) and has a struggle of his own, adding to his ideal personality, and his one big fight in the series made for the most exciting scene in all thirteen episodes.
Other superheroes, young and old, play a part in the anime, but not as significantly. For now, most others play as bystanders that observe and take a small part of the action. Everyone’s powers are rather basic and linear: super-strength, gravity, explosives, fire&ice, etc., but they’re made a little more interesting with just a bit of ingenuity. 
Battles are often accompanied by some really exciting music, much of it being orchestral with a few pieces having some electronic layers that mingle well with the instrumentation. Much of the other tracks have a good driving feel, such as the vocal-included rock track known as ‘Hero A’. If you don’t remember what that is, it’s the one that says “MY HERO!!” And uh… other things, I guess. Yeah. The seiyuu are pretty great; Izuku’s annoying whiny voice is made a little better with his emotional range and mature narration, Bakuman’s hateful, raging screams are intense as hell, and All Might has a pretty hilarious and great dichotomy between his booming, powerful voice in his superhero form and the frail, weak tone of his true form.
The OP is a good rock song, and while not as overall powerful as a mighty hero, its beginning is a striking, hype-filled section with a great hook. The visuals matching it are rather basic in direction, but effective enough, as it gives a brief look at the main character and the supporting cast with their powers. It’s good to have an action montage and actually know what the fuck is happening in it. The ED is of similar caliber, but not as dynamic or emotional as the OP. I didn’t care for it much, in comparison.
The art style is decent overall, with some great moments where it counts. Battles feature some great animation and a lot of environmental effects like smoke and fire incorporated perfectly. The characters themselves look pretty interesting, and facial expressions always lined up with the vocal performances, both soft and hard. The villains, appropriately named by the show as Villains (don’t get confused, now), are the most interesting, with the endgame’s baddie having one of the strangest appearances ever, with an edgy-as-fuck voice to match it. In a way I wanna laugh at how ridiculously emo he is, but it’s also so crazy that I can buy into it.
In the end, Hero Academia is pretty average, pretty basic. And I respect that. It doesn’t take risks and attempt something it’s not, but the amount of heart it has prevents it from feeling cheap or stale. If you want just a simple little action shounen, it’s right here. But for anyone who craves a little more, maybe you should stick with Hunter x Hunter.

                A good anime for doing homework or while at work or doing literally anything productive because I don't know how anyone can sit around and watch this while not multitasking. 
You really only need to pay attention to 1/16th of the show to know what's going on. the rest is fluff. 
I guess this is my spoiler line but who on this god forsaken earth hasn't watched  this show by now I'm so sick of seeing it so that's why I even bothered. Usually not the case but everyone says it gets better. does it? does it really? 
no.
Story: Typical. Done before. Pathetic useless
                  kid saves the world. not this season, but it's going to happen it's so predictable. 
Art: I'm okay with the art I guess, I really hate their eyes. I mean I can't draw worth shit so what do I know? But someone popped some cue balls in their eye sockets and drew pupils on them. 
Sound: I'm giving it a high rating because the dub isn't terrible. Re: multitask so my spine doesn't slide out of my body from boredom. Re: I don't speak Japanese. I can't stand most dubs, so props for finding voice actors that aren't 100% unbearable.
Character: dear god. deku is the most annoying piece of garbage. I'm whiny and awful and bully people who don't want to be around me in the name of being disgustingly nice! I hope he dies. IcyHot fills in for 'bad boy v.2' because you need that tortured soul tragic backstory bad boy. Kacchan is really the only worthwhile character and even he is pretty awful. He's mean and isn't trying to be something he isn't. he's 100% his original self. 
Enjoyment: I longed for my dentist's chair. I would rather be getting told how I need to floss more while they make me bleed than watch this anime again. 
Overall: It's childish and unoriginal. I would have loved to see the impact of everyone having these crazy powers, like the world being thrown into chaos even for a little bit? Like that had to happen. The change didn't even happen THAT long ago but everyone accepts it as normal. WHY did everyone even get these powers. I guess if you are a child you might like it. Good for some good background noise while doing finances.",5,AmericaWasntLost

                I went into Boku no Hero Academia with the certainty that I'm gonna like it, and a lot at that, because I believed it resembled one of my favorite shows - Hunter x Hunter. The similarities I expected to see weren't in plot and characters, but in genre and more important, mood. Well, I was right.
The plot of BHA is the typical shounen underdog plot - the protagonist starts out weak and maybe goes through a defeat or two by his arch rival or another strong character, only to grow stronger in the course of the story and defeat them by the end of it.
                  Done poorly, this type of story is predictable and doesn't provoke any emotions in the viewer. Done well, such a story is by no means less predictable, but it becomes strong and emotional as well. It all depends on the execution of the tropes.
Boku no Hero Academia is on the emotional side - it manages to provoke the right emotions at the right moment and THAT's the reason why I compared it to Hunter x Hunter at the beginning - because the latter does the same. The emotions BHA provokes are definite, specific, and what is most important, strong. I've seen many shows that try to force emotions into the viewer, but to no avail. With the time I've come to realize that the reason why this is unsuccessful is the vagueness of the topic in question, the uncertainty and confusion of the scene/plot, so that in the end the viewer doesn't know what kind of emotion they should be feeling. Love? Hatred? Annoyance? Euphoria? Maybe the reason is that these shows try to provoke contradictory emotions at once, so that these emotions cancel one another. Or maybe they just don't dig deep enough into the characters' minds and explore their true feelings. Or they just try to be a bit too subtle about the emotions and spare them. BHA doesn't spare anything in regard to emotions.
Another aspect of the anime I liked was its pacing. BHA is a fast-paced show that doesn't waste episodes to set up the mood - because it can do this in the course of the story instead. 
As for the characters in BHA, they might not be the most original ones in terms of personality, but they are interesting. The best part about the characters is that they are not overpowered and everyone possesses at least one major weakness. I've seen many anime shows with similar plots where everyone but the protagonist is shamelessly overpowered. Not only that, but the protagonists of such shows grow into the same or even stronger overpowered beasts as their enemies in very short a period. Which leads me to the next major asset of the characters in BHA, in this case the protagonist, Izuku - the acquiring of power. Izuku starts as quirkless, much to his dismay, only to later receive the Quirk of his favorite superhero. However, the means through which this happens differ from those in many other shows. Izuku is not gratuitously granted these powers. He has to work out to receive them - he has to deserve them. Not only that, but even after finally receiving them, he still can't make use of them without painful consequences. This places a natural limit to how strong a character can be and creates both plausibility and tension.
The rest of the cast each have their own charm. The best thing about them is that even when each of them represents a certain character archetype, they still have some quality that defines their personality as unique and belonging to only them.
Coming to the art, I found the character designs to be original and unforgettable, which is a plus. I watched the show in 720p, so the quality wasn't very good, but I still liked the animation, especially during the action sequences. Actually, the animation of BHA is one of its main assets. It further adds to the emotional appeal of the show, that is. I like shows with dynamic animation and BHA is one such show.
The sound and music were nice as well. The OP and ED were energetic and in mood with the show and I downloaded them in the end (I just couldn't help it). The overall soundtrack was nice, too. The voice acting was good - I believe the VAs did a great job with each of the characters.
As for my enjoyment, I believe it's needless to say it was high. Shounen series usually have higher enjoyment rates than other types of shows (at least to me), but only the best of them can leave me with a long-term impression. If there was anything I didn't like about Boku no Hero Academia, it was its length - I wished it could go on longer. That's why I liked Hunter x Hunter - because it was good and entertained me for two long weeks, which felt like two days, to be honest. Anyway, I'm happy that a second season has been announced and I'll be looking forward to it. I might even rewatch the first season in 1080p if it's released before the second season.
All in all, Boku no Hero Academia is an excellent shounen series and I recommend it to all shounen fans. Even if you aren't a fan of shounen, you may still find the concept about superpowers interesting.",8,Eincaster

                [Spoilers from episode 1]
I don't find the Boku no Hero series good nor bad, simply mediocre. Mediocre and generic are the most fitting words I can find to describe this show. It's like the author took all the basics of an average shonen manga and put them together hoping it would work, and it seems like it worked. Boku no Hero is one of the most overrated animes out there.
We can begin with the story. I have to say the plot didn't have much potential from the very start. The concept was poor (good heroes fighting bad villains) so you can't expect much of the
                  execution. However, when I found out in ep. 1 that the main protagonist was heavily disadvantaged (being part of the 20% of the population that does not have super-powers) I started increasing my hopes. I though this particular shonen protagonist actually wouldn't follow the clichés and find a way to become even stronger than people with powers without possessing one, some sort of humanism like in Fullmetal Alchemist about humans' true nature, infinite potential, and ability to never cease to hope, but nope: the world's strongest hero hands him down his OP power that he is throughout the plot going to gradually control (another clichè). That ""oh, he risked his own life to save someone he didn't even know so he deserves that power"" seemed to me just a cheap pretest to return to the clichè trail. I still find the story decent but seriously not more than that. Story rating: 4/10.
The animation is great. Studio Bones really did a good job making the animation fluid and impactful in relatable way (that's what you call great choreography). I didn't really like the art style though, but I guess that's just based on my subjective perspective of beautiful art. Rating: 9/10
Now, I didn't really find anything special with the soundtracks, it's simply fine. Fitting, but still mediocre. I tried the original soundtrack album and I genuinely liked a few tracks. The openings and endings are ok. Sound: 6/10
We finally come to characters. I personally find that the characters are the worst part of the series. The only round characters in the whole S1 and S2 are All Might and Todoroki (oh, and that purple -haired guy that control minds). I have serious difficulties in appreciating Deku's character. His ""genericness"" is simply annoying: the naive and bighearted but strong hero that fights against evil and to achieve his dream of becoming the strongest hero. I was so uninterested I didn't even want him to win when he was fighting, and that is, for a main character, not a good thing. The other characters are just as clichè: the big, good, naive nerd, the friendly (naive as well) girl, the cold-blooded badass, the Kakashi-ish fan service character, the impulsive, warm-blooded rude guy that is intrinsically nice and finally the protagonist's mentor, the one Deku desires to become. I have seen every single one of these character types in other animes of movies. The characters could hardly get more uninteresting, poor and unoriginal. Characters: 3/10
As for enjoyment, it was enough good to make me complete S1 and half of S2, but rarely enough good to excite me and actually make me even speculate about what is going to happen next. Enjoyment/entertainment: 4/10.
As sad before, I find Boku no Hero simply average, not fine but not bad. The animation's greatness cannot be denied, but I feel like this manga didn't deserve such a great adaptation (I'm still talking about the animation). I really can't understand how it could get so popular. Overall rating: 5/10.",5,Hikou_Senshi

                I was actually pretty surprised how much I ended up liking this anime. It didn`t look ike it was going to be anything special but this season was great. This season mostly feels like an introduction to the series. It`s only 13 episodes so theres not much and can finish this fairly quickly.
Story: 8
The story in this was actualy unique but strangely familiar. It feels like a Naruto or a DragonBall Z at times. The fights can in this are also amazing.
Art 7 and Sound 7:
Nothing to special with these two, the anime looks pretty good and the animation stays good quality in the fights.
                  The sound was also decent, nothing great but nothing bad.
Character: 9
I actually really liked the characters. There`s a nice balance between the main and supporting characters. Plus some of the villains in this look pretty badass. It`s a nice setup for the series to come.
Overall: 8
Overall this was a surprising joy. I would recommend waiting for the second season to come out though because they kinda leave you hanging towards the end.",8,Velek

                So this is going to be a review of the first season of my hero academia! 
*SPOILERS ALERT*
My hero academia was probably the most hyped up anime of this season and it's understandable why, it's the next big shonen according to alot of people. Now does it live up to it's hype? It certainly did for me!
Story:
Simple, in a future where 80% of the world population have manifested a power like ability referred as a Quirk! These powers can be anything from psychic abilites to fiery explosions. Anyways our protagonist Izuku Midoriya is a boy who want to become a strong hero like his role
                  model, the strongest hero: All might. 
Problem is that he is one of the few minority without a quirk, this leaves him devestated but he still strives to get in to his dream highschool: U.A.
As the anime  progress Midoriya manage to acquire a powerful quirk trough his role model All might. But to use this quirk he must train hard to be a worthy vessel.
The story takes place during Midoriyas first year at highschool. The story itself is very simple and not very complicated. I found the story very exciting an wanting more. The story is simple but brings out the best in it. An intresting story that will keep you hooked. 
Art:
The studio behind Hero Academia is Bones who are known for both the FMA series and Noragami. It aint no madhouse but bones does a really good job and does the manga justice. Beautiful brightful colors and the fight scenes are also animated very well. Especially All might vs Nomu which is considerd by many as the best fight since Saitama vs Boros. 
Overall a fantastic job done by Bones, cudos to them!
Sound: 
The soundtrack is to be honest outstanding. It captures moments like All might vs Nomu soooooo well and it hypes you up! You get super excited at some scenes which is contributed by the great soundtracks. 
Character:
The Characters are very shonen like. There is this cool guy, there is this hotblooded guy, A girl who has a crush on the main character and so on. If you like shonens you will definitely enjoy the characters, if you dont like shonens then you probably wont as much but you might still like them. 
The first season focused alot on Midoriya as a Character and he got a good bit of development. From being a insecure cry baby he actually becomes alot more confident in himself and developes as a person. He's not so nervous around people as he used to be and actually stands up to his bully!
Enjoyment/Overall:
I like shonens but they were starting to get a bit boring to me and predictable but hero academia reignited the fire inside of me. I have not enjoyed a Shonen like this in a long time and it feels great. With beautiful brightful colors and a fantastic soundtrack to go with the action you cant help but smile and fangirl/boy at some points as you get caught up in the moment. Im not being a Fanboy right now as i had kind of low expectations on this series and tough it would turn out to be popular first and then decrease like Fairy tail but after reading the manga to i can say that it will only get better from here on with every arc.
Hero Academia is here to stay and will stay for a long time as it's not going to end anytime soon! Just sit back and enjoy this Masterpiece in the making!",10,FireFistYK

                Boku no Hero Academia Review
Story (8/10) Very Good
More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good 
The Story Arcs that Season 1 of Boku No Hero Academia covers where very good arcs. Setup arcs, exam arcs and a ambush arc basically. They were all very well done and the pacing was very good also. This first couple arcs do indeed focus a lot more on Izuzku, All Might and Bokugou more than any of the other characters so if you were looking for more attention from any other character than isn't those three than you might feel just a tad but unsatisfied. It had very good built up to
                  the end of this very good season. 
Art and Animation (8/10) Very Good
More Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+
Everyone say the names of the animators and the company that would be behind the adaptation of Boku No Hero and where really happy that it was in the hands of Bones because their track record is not bad but very good actually the only thing they are known for that shines in a bad light to some digree is giving us original endings that weren't in the manga. Examples the first FMA and Noragami Season 1. But when it came to Boku No Hero they didn't do that it adapted everything very well from and from an animation standpoint it was very good also it wasn't the best but it's definitely not bad to no degree. The hypest fight we had to look forward to was on episode 12 and although the fight was well animated a drop in art style during that fight scene did that place which didn't happen anywhere else in the entire season but it will most likely get cleaned up in the retail releases but for right now that's the only thing I can truly nitpick at from an animation or art style standpoint.
Sound (9/10) Great 
The sound is probably the best part of this series the Opening and the ending match the series and I didn't skip them once. The BGM and sound effects during the anime was also great also I would call it a masterpiece but it's great nonetheless. Voice acting was on point also (JP VA) I know the dub started and I haven't heard it so I  am only talking about the Japanese voice acting.
Characters (8/10) Very Good
More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good
The characters in Boku No Hero Academia were very good also. Not great because like I said before majority of them weren't really focused on in this season just an introduction of their powers and a bit of screen time here and there but for the characters there were focused on we did get enough to keep us or at least me entertained enough to not have a huge problem with the fact that the others didn't get enough screen time.
Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good
More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good
My Enjoyment for Boku No Hero was very good I was always present the day the episode aired and I enjoyed every single episode fairly. Bones to a very good job bring this series to life.
Overall (8/10) Very Good
More Specifically (8.65/10) Very Good+ 
Boku No Hero Academia anime adaptation I think succeeded as it covered the first 21 chapters of the manga in 12 episodes and announced a Season 2 for next year. Popularity for this series will skyrocket and Bones did it justice.",8,Rikuson1

                Warning possible Spoilers
In less than a year we got two amazing anime's that defined the superhero genre One Punch Man and My Hero Academia, but Hero Academia decides to go a different route that makes it just as good as OPM.
The story is set in a world where 80% of the human population have different superpowers called Quirks, Izuku Midoriya want's to be a hero just like his idol All Might, but he was born without a Quirk until he unexpectedly encounters All Might himself where he discovers a secret that begins his journey of being a Hero.
What I really love about the story is
                  pretty much the whole premise because watching just felt like if Marvel and DC had a baby and this is what we got which is goddamn amazing and it truly shows you what it means to be a hero and seeing Midoriya along with his other superpowered friends learn what it takes to be a hero was definitely an entertaining ride as the situations they encountered when testing out their quirks and even encountering villains would show what they are really capable of.
The biggest part of the story is seeing the mentor/student relationship between Midoriya and All Might as All Might has chosen him to be his successor for his power it showed a very respectable and trustworthy relationship between the two as Midoriya would listen for what is required to make sure his body can withstand the effects of the power while All Might makes sure he doesn't push himself to the point where it'll hurt him further and Midoriya also reminded All Might what it means to be a true hero as his admiration towards him and the people around relit the spark he had lost.
I liked how it also focused on Midoriya's relationships with some of the other hero's who all thought he was useless to begin with, but after seeing some the actions he made their respect for him did grow and his respect for them grew too even to the point where he would sacrifice himself for them, it was also interesting seeing the students learn how to use their quirks properly and how to work as a team which makes the bond between them slowly grow especially when they had to fight villains together which made them look like a very capable bunch even if they had been split into separate groups.
Now there is a huge amount of characters in this show especially when it comes to the student hero's, but not all of them are probably worth mentioning since a few don't say that many lines.
Izuku Midoriya is the male MC and begins without a quirk until All Might gives him his own to him, Midoriya usually screams or whimpers a lot which might annoy people, but it makes sense since he has been surrounded and bullied by quirk users like Bakugo until recently and despite this he is actually a brave person willing to make snap decisions in the case if someone is in danger which has saved a few characters lives to be honest, he is a determined, honest and kind-hearted person as his dream is to be a hero so he can protect everyone which seems like a very good reason to like the guy plus he has studied every superhero's powers meaning in combat he can be very strategic and helpful when fighting enemies even when he can't use his quite often.   
All Might is the No.1 hero and is known as the symbol of Peace along being Midoriya's mentor, he has two forms to him his hero form and his true form as he sustained an injury that has been making him use his powers less and less which is why he has been looking for a replacement, at first he seems like a cool guy who would never be afraid of a fight, but really he is always afraid and has lost sight if what it means to be a hero until Midoriya shows him that meaning again which is why he chose Midoriya, he can be a very over the top guy though he is very protective and takes matters very seriously if the situation might end up with people getting hurt.
Katsuki Bakugo is Midoriya's rival in some case and has the quirk explosion, I honestly do not like him to some extent because he starts out as an overconfident, selfish and very egotistical idiot and he is always angry no matter what, he always makes everyone seem below him especially Midoriya because he has no quirk yet he still wants to be a hero which really annoys him, but his character does get slightly better by the end since he encounters other people who have powers better than his and the fight he has with Midoriya starts to make him open his eyes more, but he still remains an angry jerk.
Ochako Uraraka is a female student at the academy and her quirk is zero gravity, she becomes Midoriya's friend very quickly since he saved her life during the entrance exam, she is a very kind and sweet person since she was willing to give Midoriya some of her points after he saved her life, she is often making sure her friends are ok as long she isn't suffering herself since using her powers often does make her sick.
Tenya Iida is a male student who is part of a respectable superhero family and his quirk is engine, at first he looks scary, but he is a very honest and strict person since he takes being a hero very seriously and he did underestimate Midoriya until he sacrificed himself to save Uraraka during the entrance exam which then made him respect Midoriya more and became a good friend of his, he eventually becomes the class president because Midoriya believe's he is a good leader.
Tsuyu Asui is another female student who has the quirk frog which is literally frog powers, her personality may look plain, but she is actually a protective, sharp and intelligent person since she was the first who noticed how similar Midoriya's and All Might's quirks were.
Shouta Aizawa is another teacher at the academy whose quirk is Erasure, he is a very cold and apathetic teacher and even said that whoever came last during practise would be expelled and he didn't see the potential in Midoriya until he showed Aizawa that he could control his powers in some way,but he does care about his students and even risked his life to protect them when the villains attacked them.
Minoru Mineta is the smallest student at the academy and his quirk is pop off, he is shown to be a pretty perverted and joker like, but he doesn't do well during battles as he went into a crying fit when the villains attacked until Midoriya gave him the courage to fight back.
Momo Yaoyorozu is another female student at the academy whose quirk is creation, she has incredible analytic skills as she deduced why Midoriya and Uraraka didn't do a good job against Bakugo and Tenya in their training battle making her a very intelligent and calm member of the team and despite appearing blunt she just wants to make sure her friends become great heroes.
Shouto Todoroki is a male student who was recommended for the  academy since his quirk has the power to control both cold and hot temperatures, he isn't shown much as he mainly keeps to himself, but he is very deductive often trying to figure out things that seem mysterious like when the villains attacked the students and he froze some to find answers.
I know there are other characters who made some kind of impression, but the others that I haven't mentioned there isn't much to talk about them even though some like Mina, Eijirou, Fumikage and Tooru seem like very interesting characters, but with the amount of characters in this show that make up one class it would be difficult to give any of them screentime especially when Tooru is completely invisible which be difficult to make her a well known character since you always keep forgetting her, but the students in this class all seem like interesting characters that have something waiting for us to see.
Of course there is the villain too who is Tomura he is pretty much a psychopath who is bent on killing All Might, but even though he doesn't look prepared for a fight he shouldn't be messed with since he is very tactical and intelligent often evading a lot of attacks against him and his quirk allows him to make people slowly disintegrate making him a dangerous foe to get near, I thought he was pretty intimidating for a weak looking guy.
The artstyle looked really good and fitted the way the show was, I really liked the design's of the characters as they all seemed different which is always a good thing to me and it was even better how some of them didn't even look human which showed how extensive quirk powers could be, the costumes that the students wore were really good too which put some of Marvel and DC's superhero costumes in their place.
I also have to say that the soundtrack along with the op and ed was great, it was epic and always came in at the right time it made the show feel even more like a proper superhero show.
I liked the variety of superpowers in this show and instead of being called superpowers they were given a name that was more befitting with how they come to be, the amount of different powers was also intriguing since each one seemed very cool despite looking like they are just a variation we have seen from Marvel and DC superheroes.
The action is this show was very exciting and were planned out very well because we don't see heroes and villains going at it with fists and furry we actually get to see some strategy and teamwork too as it was really interesting seeing the characters trying to evaluate a situation and seeing how effective their power would be against the enemy and whether they should attack them or avoid them as they don't know the enemies strengths too, but we also get to see the students fight each other which helped them show how well their powers would do in an actual battle and also brought some conflict about with certain characters too.
There was also a decent amount of comedy though not as much as I remembered don't get me wrong the jokes were funny, but this show was more serious than funny because there was a lot of moments between Midoriya and All Might that were pretty inspirational and somewhat sentimental too.
Overall this is a brilliant superhero anime and I can't wait for the second season to finish so i can binge on it and hopefully be completely amazed by it because this is definitely a show I wouldn't mind running for a good while since there are so many opportunities here.",9,Tyrannicswine117

                My hero academia is very overrated and generic. 
I got into anime from One Punch Man. I binge-watched it and i really enjoyed it. When I asked my friend to reccomend me more stuff like OPM he told me to watch MHA. I watched 3 episodes from it and I unfriended him.
STORY: 2
If you made a program that generates shounen anime and left everything on default settings, you'd get MHA's plot.
ART: 9
Art is easily the best thing about the show. The animation is great and smooth. Sadly, because of the dull battles, the animation doesn't live up to it's potential.SOUND: 6
The opening is cool, i guess. The OST isn't half-bad either.
CHARACTERS: 1
I despise the characters in the show. I can count the only enjoyable characters on my fingers; They are: All-Might, Class Rep, Pervert, Teacher, Principal and Grandma. 
Deku is a crying cunt. His main trait is being very emotional and sensitive, because of his (kinda hyperbolic) backstory. And that is alright, but please, Deku cries in every fucking battle he is in. It gets really annoying very quickly and I hate him.
Uraraka is 15 stop jacking off to her, you sickos.
All-Might is the best main character in the show. Hands down.
The villian(hand guy) is just there beacuse the show needs an antagonistic force(the villians call themselves the League of Villians, cringe).
ENJOYMENT: 4
The battles are unnecesserily long and boring. The part where Deku punches the big robot is cool. The animation there is great. 
The part where Deku rushes in to save Bakugo is also nice, but he cries again.
OVERALL: 5
Overrated crap with nice art and like 4 good charactes.",5,bojoenderg

                Hey, frickin villains tryna turn the city topsy turvy, wussies never acted this tough when the world were just filled with robbers and cops- Ey! ey that's mah groceries! Yo get back here! You better be scared cuz mah quirk is a gun! Yeah that's right fool, back off.
You might be thinking: ""Hey its gotta be one of those generic shonen again, I ain't got time fo that."" You might be just too far off right there. Boku no hero academia is quite unique, for the first season I guess, it doesn't really follow the overused cliché that is being seen in every shonen, the
                  formula would always be the main protagonist starts off weak, and then just becomes the most overpowered thing ever, that's not the case here though. From the start to the end of the first season, the show was able to maintain the concentration of the cast within the show and it doesn't just cut them off one by one too. The 'Power' of the main protagonist is also maintained throughout the show, *SPOILERS* even in the end, he was not shown off as the most piece of unkillable trash like most shonen always falls into, making Boku no hero Academia a slightly different shonen in terms of formula.
The plot is linear just like all the shonen you've seen, that's right it's the, ""I wanna become the very best!"" cliché, but that's ok, because everyone wants to be the best too, kind of overused but relatable, especially if you're in a world where superpowers can be obtained that easily. The Artstyle is nice, it has that superhero comic visual going on which is very fitting, and the animations were done very well, it looks very smooth. The music I must say, such beautiful opening, a fresh change of pace of melody within the anime industry, probably one of the anime openings that I never skipped. 
Finally the characters, now this is where most shonen have failed, a few succeed to not neglect this category, and one of them is Boku no hero academia, imagine you write like 10-20 bunch of characters, and all of them have different personalities, different ambitions, different minds, and now add different superpowers into the mix, with conditions, executions and flashy animations, that might hurt your head a bit, especially if you're doing a whole series focusing on every one of them.
There are a few flaws I found in this anime, one of it is the overdramatic protagonist, like seriously, if you give him a waterproof sack, he's gonna be fillin it up in an hour or so just by his obnoxious crying. Secondly, I do not like how the pacing feel throughout the entire season, I guarantee you there are fillers in there, like *SPOILERS* near the end, it was so frustrating how sometimes an episode gives you barely nothing new than what was presented in the previous one, Whenever I was about to get into an episode, and then the ending starts rolling in, I'm like, ""No, no no, that can't be it! What happens next!?"" Either that, or i'm just too enjoying it, and it never felt enough.
I must say, Boku no hero academia might just be the dark horse of the Shonen genre of the season, and I will look forward to finishing the second season, and even judging it from a stagnant perspective, I for sure knew it would get a season 2 because of how short the first season felt like. 
And dahell was with All might's moves? Frickin cringey American punches, I mean seriously? Detroit Smash?? Oh wait, that's really funny and ironic actually.... P.S: Invisigirl best waifu!",8,LoneKnightKipa

                So, I just finished the final episode minutes before sitting down to write this. Was this my favorite show of the season? Yes. I’d say it’s tied up between this and “Re:Zero.” Hero Academia gets some special points though because it really fired me up in a way that I used to get fired up for shonen anime back in the day. 
Hero Academia really makes me think of something like a particularly good Naruto arc with all the filler cut out.
So what made this show so great? I think it’s probably for the same reasons One Punch Man was such a wild success, people
                  like a good hero. Dark, gritty, real, none of those are words you would use to describe either of our heroes in Hero Academia or One Punch Man. In both of these anime the hero is someone who genuinely wants to help people. (Sure, I guess you could argue that Saitama is a self proclaimed hero for fun, but at the end of the day he’s not the type to walk passed a mugging just because he didn’t really feel like being a hero that day, and I think the fact that in his heart he’s truly self sacrificing for the greater good is shown throughout the series.)
The trend recently is to make things real. Heroes might not all be so good, sometimes good people do bad things for the right reasons, sometimes seemingly good people ultimately have a very dark ulterior motive, all that jazz. It’s everywhere in movies, games, anime, you name it. Goody two shoes have taken a very hard fall out of being fashionable. But I think people actually like a genuine hero more than they like a “real” hero because the “real” heroes don’t give us anything to believe in. I thought “Man of Steel” was a cool movie, but it didn’t make me want to be Superman. The really corny, always doing the best thing for everyone Superman? That guy actually makes me want to be a super hero. And I think My Hero Academia tapped into that same vein. It made me want to be a hero like All Might, and in doing so it made me really relate to Midoriya’s aspirations. 
Watching Midoriya fight against the odds to fulfill his dream made me want to fight for my dreams too, the same way superman swooping in to save a cat from a tree or jumping in front of a kryptonite fueled train inspires me to be heroic too.",8,Spooty

                My Hero Academia was an anime that missed it's chance to be a good anime.
It's not like I really wanted to hate it. From the hype it was getting I expected something that would be enjoyable to watch, but unfortunately, it ended up being anything but that which was a huge disappointment. What initially drew me to the show was the superhero theme that the show was suppose to be going for which would've been all well and good had it not been for the characters, the way the plot played out, and most disappointingly the fact that this anime focused way too much on
                  Deku and All Might.
I'm not saying that having them as the main focus is a bad thing, but in the 13 episodes the anime had the other characters basically irrelevant to the point where the only thing that we learn about them are one or two personality trits and what their super power is. This brings up another issue I had with this anime and that is the way the characters were presented.
In all honestly, I found basically every character to be one dimensional cliches of your typical anime characters. Deku was a wimp that wanted to be strong, Bakugo was a jerk with an inferiority complex, and All Might was a Dues Ex Machina hero with super strength. Their traits were so stereotypical that I was able to predict what each of them planned to do in the episodes they were in which made my viewing experience less enjoyable.
Even the so called plot was nothing more than reasons to make Deku looked like a competent hero when really he was just a typical protagonist that wouldn't think before he acted which almost got him killed on multiple occasions. Even in instances where there were less risky solutions he chose the options that no only put his own life in danger, but also left him with more damage than he should've taken because he could'nt control his power which would'nt have even been the case if he actually attempted to trained with his power to avoid all of the unnecessary damage he took which he obviously didn't. 
I will say that one thing this anime got correctly was that it wasn't trying to be more that what it should've been. All this anime was suppose to be was a shounen underdog anime which is definitely is, though I will say that in terms of execution it falls short on so many levels. I wished this anime took the time to showcase the other characters because they appeared to be more interesting than the ones we actually got to see in action. All I can really is that Academia is failed potential and with season 2 already confirmed I hope it will be better and actually give a reason to enjoy it.

                Boku no Hero Academia is one of the worst shows Marvel has ever produced. When I found out that Jon Favreau had given the rights to this series to a Japanese studio, I was surprised but not necessarily worried. I figured that Marvel wouldn’t bestow the responsibility to uphold the very esteemed MCU to just anyone. I guess I was wrong to trust the anime industry to produce anything without the highest saturation of tropes possible. Boku no Hero Academia has reaffirmed my disdain for generic shounens. It basically jumps through every hoop required for your typical “ordinary kid inherits amazing power and tries to
                  fit in with the rest of the Avengers and saves the day” show. I felt like I was watching the conglomeration of everything I hate about anime for the teenage demographic. It was written so safe and close to the chest that there’s no way it wouldn’t be a success. I wish I was the executive who is getting paid for this commercially huge series so that I could continue to make cynical and colorful garbage which everyone would eat up like a god damn McDonald’s taro pie. The only reason I finished this whole first season instead of stopping halfway is because I wanted to see if I was being too judgmental. Maybe it got crazy near the end and it would be ultimately worth it. I’ve been proven wrong before, so I might as well be optimistic about one of the most popular anime ever. But I was fully disappointed this time, and the only thing I got out of watching it was this review. Thanks for nothing, Stan Lee.

A Superhero Shounen anime with a predictable and not so original story, still manages to live up to your expectations! Playing a true underdog story, you follow Midoria (a quirk less wannabe hero) who has no real power but dreams of becoming the greatest hero like his idol All Might. Midoria stands out due to his undeniable drive of ‘Never give up, Never Surrender’ attitude to protect and save people despite lacking powers. The struggle of Midoria for wanting to be a superhero and to only realize he has no powers is nicely displayed, fully grasping his motives of
                  desperation and crushed dreams. You wholly sympathize with Midoria, who’s a superhero nerd with a real superhero spirit, so you are just as emotionally invested and satisfied when his fate changes. All Might shares the same principles, coming across as an anime Superman though with some limitations! He has this bad habit of saving people at the cost of his health, constantly sacrificing himself by doing superhero actions. We know he has limited time so there’s this constant air of concern whenever he’s in action. The other characters are not well developed with the stand out being Midoria’s explosive powered rival, Bakugou who plays more than just a typical male Tsundere. His future is unknown as the show hints him as a potential villain but he goes through his own character development. Coming to UA has his pride completely crushed at the hands of defeat from Midoria and the realization that he’s not the best in his class, power nor intelligent wise. Since its only 13 episodes, too many characters get little screen time and their powers are only exhibited in the last 3 episodes. The same goes for the villains as well, barely introduced yet pertaining to an evil plan of a bigger magnitude.
Even though the art style is a tad bit childish, the character designs are very colourful, giving off the superhero vibe appropriately. The entire anime seems like it leapt out of the manga. Still the animation is weakly in some areas, either some character design would lose focus or the background will look incomplete. The facial expressions play in with the comedic light nature of the show while also delivering blood pumping, nonstop action when needed to. You won’t find any dull action scenes as all of them will bring you to the edge of your seat regardless of knowing the end! 
The Dub is wonderfully realized with great voice acting for Midoria and All Might. Lara Woodhull perfectly delivers the out of the box personality while Christopher Sabat totally commands All Might with his booming voice. The OP/ED are enjoyable to listen to especially the well-timed use of that one track whenever something epic is going to happen! 
Overall you will either love ‘My Hero Academia’ or you will find it a waste of time. It’s unique style of art and great OST is mixed within a clichéd superhero story that manages to stand out despite its flaws! From showcasing the price to pay for being a superhero to the bond between All Might and Deku, the drama between Deku and Bakugou and the last 3 episodes epic Shounen action and comradery among the students sets Season 1 as an amazing and entertaining set up for the next Season! Totally recommend it and a perfect 10 for me due to its re-watchable factor!",10,PakiUSA

                Ah, Boku no Hero. Probably the shonen of the season. Aclaimed by many, is it that good? Let's see.
Story: 6
A normal kid with no powers wants to be a hero. This would be appalling and unoriginal as hell if everyone else have any powers too, but this is not the case. Everyone but him have a different kind of superpower, what allows the anime to emphatize the MC's fears and insecurities. The story flows smoothly since the first chapter
Art & Sound: 7
The animation has that Gainax-ish vibe, making it enyoyable, but we don't have a lot of action here to truly shine this animation. Opening
                  theme and animation are good enough, being so catchy, and the soundtrack, well...has its moments, but follows nicely the way in the epic moments this series has.
Character: 7
The MC is that archetype of character. Yes, i mean the untalented young boy who want to be the very best (in this case to be a hero and help others), doing his best effort to achieve it. However, while he's an archetype, he's a pretty good character and well developed. You feel his progress during the show. No stupid power-ups (hi Ichigo), just a boy making progress slowly, and that's kinda rare in a shonen.
Boku no Hero has many secondary characters: All Might, the best hero, is another archetype. Again, in this case this is not bad: All Might's mission is to inspire, to be the reference. And he does hella good.
Deku's classmates are well characterized but not developed at all just because the anime is incomplete, but you have an idea of their dreams and personalities with just a couple of arcs. Especial mention to Bakugo, Deku's childhood rival, always invaded by anger, that can by exhausting to see. But he's more than it seems, showing moments of wit and cold blood.
Enjoyment: 8
I enjoyed a lot this series, despite being short or a shonen. Well, i watched 9 episodes in a row, nothing more to say.
Overall: 7
This is a good anime. Average story, while a bit original, good narrative, but the main problem is that is currently incomplete. Let's see if the second season fulfill the good expectations created in this one.
""Do you recommend this anime?"" Yes. especially if you are a shonen fan.
If you liked Boku no Hero Academia, take a look to:
- Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, pure epicness with nice characters, story and narrative.
- Hunter x Hunter, probably, among One Piece, one of the best shounen series out there.",7,davidgvidal
31964,"
                TL;DR at the bottom in the form of Pros/Cons.
*Contains some miniscule spoilers, none of which particularly affect the viewing experience*
Boku no Hero Academia is the anime that took the Summer 2016 season by storm. With a rather popular source (a manga with the same name, published on the infamous 'Shounen Jump') and high production values, coupled with the fact that it was produced by Bones, BnHA was bound to be good - and it did not disappoint.
There have been many points that BnHA has been criticized for, the most common of them being that it lacks originality. Certainly, the story has a 'been there, done
                  that' feeling, since it features a bullied underdog protagonist in a world which looks suspiciously like something straight out of One Punch Man. What most people fail to notice is that under that clichéd exterior, it is so much more. BnHA is an anime that takes all things shounen, polishes it up and presents it with a twist of American comics thrown in. It manages to portray a vast array of emotions in a rather short one-cour time-frame.
Story (8/10):
The story of BnHA seems fairly typical to begin with. The first 2-3 episodes maintain a relatively slow pace, which makes some viewers turn up their noses at the series. Yet, these initial episodes are absolutely necessary to set up the world, introduce the most important characters and to explain Deku's past. After these episodes, the pace picks up considerably as it moves to the UA entrance arc. From then on, it's a roller-coaster ride of action and emotions (Or basically, all things shounen).
Note that the entire first season of BnHA is simply an introduction to the series and there is a ton of amazing content left to adapt. The best thing is that the anime adaptation is extremely faithful to its source.
Art (9/10):
Just goes to show what studios can do with a decent budget. The animation of BnHA, though not eye-candy like One Punch Man, is still very fluid and detailed.
Sound (9/10):
The OP and ED were both quite good, though the ED was quite a lot better. The soundtracks were right for each situation and nothing really felt overly jarring. In effect, it was fairly well done.
Characters (10/10):
This is the one section where BnHA has gone above and beyond its competition. BnHA features a vast array of characters, each of whom has been given ample screen time. I cannot explain all of them (because I think there's some sort of word limit), so I'll be sticking to just three.
-Midoriya Izuku (Deku): The protagonist of BnHA. He starts out as a weak teenager who is often bullied by his classmates, primarily by Bakugou Katsuki (Kacchan). Since he lacks a quirk, his peers consider him inferior, but his enthusiasm to become a hero just adds fuel to the fire. Deku's life changes (vastly for the better) when he meets his idol, the #1 hero, All Might. BnHA mainly focuses on Deku's journey to becoming a Hero, mostly on his time in High school.
Deku is a fairly well built character - an underdog from the start, hence not being in the least bit overconfident; courageous while knowing his limits; thinks his way through and possesses the drive to do his best. Though occasionally jittery and nervous, he is a likable character on the whole.
-Bakugou Katsuki (Kacchan): Kacchan is Deku's childhood friend/enemy, who always makes it a point to look down on him. He was determined to be a genius right from when he was a child and the manifestation of a powerful quirk just added to his self-important nature. Kacchan considers himself above everyone else, which is partially true, since he is usually by far the best of his peers. His irritation with Deku started when Deku claimed that he also wanted to be a Hero, a role that Kacchan looked up to. Over the course of BnHA, Kacchan grows the become one of Deku's greatest rivals.
Kacchan initially seems like a block of dumb muscle, but is revealed to have quite a lot of aptitude for coming up with strategies as well. His actions and behavior often hinge on his self-confidence and pride.
-All Might: Everyone's idol, The Symbol of Peace, All Might is the world's #1 Hero. Deku has worshiped him from a very young age and is overwhelmed when they meet... but Deku soon realizes that there is more than what meets the eye when it comes to the Greatest Hero. All Might is the character who acts as catalyst and a gateway for Deku's journey to become the greatest. He plays the mentor for Deku in many ways, while being quite badass in general.
Enjoyment (9/10):
All said and done, it is undeniable that BnHA is a very enjoyable show. As someone who is a huge fan of the original manga, this adaptation felt almost panel-perfect. The last 3 episodes in particular, were exceptionally well done.
Overall (9/10):
Boku no Hero Academia, as stated before, is a very shounen anime. Many of the events and sequences in this anime can be predicted by those who have some understanding of how shounen anime work. Yet, this series excels in its execution to such an extent that most other flaws can be overlooked. BnHA is an excellent anime to watch in any situation, while being a very good starter anime as well (due to the Western Comic influences). Overall, it is a series that I would recommend to almost anyone.
TL;DR? Here's a quick summary.
Pros:
-Great production values
-Shounen done right
-Large cast of unique characters
-Even pacing
Cons:
-Slow start (3-4 eps)
-May seem clichéd to those who have watched too much shounen",9,DarthBob

                I enjoyed fighting/shonen shows, so you would know I enjoyed this show a lot. If you were to compare it, One Punch Man would have the closest setting to it, but this show would be psychologically more in depth. If you start comparing them, then you might underrate this show a lot. Now, that said, this is what I had to say about the show.
Story (9/10)
This show, unlike most Shonen Jump shows, do a shorter episode length instead of ""Do it until the latest chapter"" style from older formats (The Big Three Shonen Jump shows being prime example), or the 25 episodes for more recent
                  format (say, Shokugeki no Soma or Haikyuu). Because of that, the pacing would be quite slow, as they are covering only two arcs of the manga, but rest assured, they make every episode worth watching. There was no filler episodes, everything is from the manga, and they were good. Talking about a powerless person in a superpower society setting? It's not like it has not been done before, the hero actually have to work for his power, and even after that still needs to master it, are quite...generic, but hey, it's a good formula and get you hyped up whenever we comes to the fight scene.
Art (8/10)
The artwork is good, but I almost thought they had to allocate the budget wisely, because there were times I thought things can be better looking, but hey, I'm comparing it with One Punch Man which does even better job at art. Also, because it uses a lot of American comic style when it comes to All Might, you might find the artwork shifts from time to time a lot.
Sound (9/10)
I love the OP and EP, which is rare, considering they usually make one hype song and one not. But they did two fast soundtrack, and I kinda like it. Also, the battle scene BGM is quite hype.
Character (7/10)
Now, despite having 2 arcs over 13 episodes, the background characters still require more screentime. Don't get me wrong, many have quite unique Quirks/abilities/superpowers. But aside from the few around the main characters, the whole class are not really memorable. And they are in like half of the season. And because the characters would not get their arcs until the second, third, maybe even fourth seasons (and even then more characters get introduced), just don't get too attached to the girl in the background until like the third season maybe.
Enjoyment (10/10)
I enjoyed this show a lot, part of it because of how much tweaking they had to do to make the supposed 13 episodes. I know the story can be finished in less than 13, but the fact that I feel no filler was made (only added scene) makes me enjoy it a lot more. Also it does do some funny scene which made the whole series even better (Yeah, I always fall for the 'shonen fighting plus do some funny stuff to make things better' trap),
Overall (8/10)
This is a show I thought you can enjoy even if you don't like a lot of superheroes shows. The story may be generic, but it does not depict superheroes as the winner most of the time, which is something I thought makes it quite interesting. However, because it has to set up a lot of things for the future, it may be good if you pushed it aside until the next season is near (which there is).",8,luckyu19

                I absolutely HATED the story because it is the most cliche series up to date.
The whole ""I want to be a superhero""  plot has never really done it for me.
Though ""Cliches"" only exist because certain plot elements have been done so many times before,
but this ISN'T A RACE ON WHO DOES IT FIRST/EARLIER, it's about WHO DID IT BETTER and
Boku no Hero Academia by far delivered immensely.
Story 7/10
The story revolves around Midoryia, whom of which has no powers in a world where
super natural powers have been given to practically everyone. Midoryia despite not 
having any powers still wants to become a hero and tries
                  to pursue it.
This series made me feel/cheer for a character(Midoryia) 
quicker than any series in my entire lifetime of anime and manga, it literally
only took 2 episodes.
THE CHOSEN ONE!
In anime/manga, it takes time for you to care about the characters.
For example, Luffy from One Piece, Naruto(9 tails), Edward from FMAB, Gintoki, Yato from Noragami,
Okabe from Steins;Gate, Lelouch from Code Geass, list goes on and on...
practically every single series takes you 10 episodes and or 20 chapters or longer for you 
to care about the main characters. If any of the main characters die right near the beginning
you'd probably shrug your shoulders and not give a shit, because quite frankly
they ALL have that ""CHOSEN ONE"" trait. 
They're all good and or a natural at something
born with some special skill or some hidden power or some destiny to fulfill or some
trait that gets them a harem or some girl/guy suddenly protecting/taking a liking to them asap or they are born hot and good looking.
It takes time for you to take a liking to these characters, to develop with them and start cheering for them because most likely
they're better off than you are.
As said earlier, Boku no Hero Academia made me cheer and feel for the main character straight off the bat very quick, which I will get into.
Characters 8/10:
Midoryia is not born with nothing. He isn't physically attractive, he doesn't have any powers, absolutely nothing.
I take that back.... he has BELOW nothing. He has a negative value of .. infinity.
His body is pretty weak and fragile, his self confidence is tinier than an ant, the list goes on.
Not only is he below nothing but he's shoved to the ground.
His doctor tells him to just give up his dream, he constantly gets laughed at by society, pushed around, beaten up.
I take it back, he isn't shoved into the ground... he's shoved into the Earths crust.
No support from anyone, he smiles and sucks up the pain when getting laughed/beaten by society, doesn't fight back and cries, continues forward, and its sooo utterly painful to watch.
Like... come the fuck on, GIVE HIM.... JUST 1 TINY CHOSEN ONE ASPECT LISTED ABOVE FOR FRICKEN SAKE.
One remarkable plot point that this character has is that anything and everything he will do and recieve in the future will and if not be 10000% EARNED.
Out of all the series I've watched so far, none of them start from below 0.
Midoriya has to work very very hard just to even touch 0 in this world. He earns everything he will get. Even more touching is that he'd probably go Saitama(One Punch Man) and be an unofficial hero if he loses his mind. This show sends the message that if you aren't the chosen one, take it and make it so you are.
Aside from Midoriya, rest of the characters are pretty cliched, not really much to say, hardly focused on them yet.
Also noted, there are HUGE battle flaws in every character which personally grounds the series to more realism
+1
Art & Sound 10/10
I give all series this score, as long as animation is consistent, and music matches the mood, I don't really care.
These categories are way too subjective, hence I don't really bother.
That noted, the music in this series BLOWS ME OUT OF THE WATER. Highly impactful emotional pieces.
Enjoyment 10/10
Seeing Midoriya go from -1000 to 0 and then hopefully proceeding higher in the future is what made everything enjoyable.
The sound track matched so many scenes well, this series delivered a punch straight in the gut.
Overall 10/10
""Cliche"" to some, but when you look at it more distantly, it blows your mind. Maybe it could be because it's so relatable.
If you're born with a silver spoon, you might not feel what this series is conveying. 
As said earlier, this isn't a race on who makes it first, but who makes it better and  by far this series blew me away.
The reasons why I'm giving this a straight 10/10 is because it made me care about a character in the matter of 2 episodes than any other series does in 100s",10,peanutbutters

                *Spoilers ahead *
This show seemed to get quite a lot of hype and attention on the internet and anime forums, so i though - ""Why not check it out?"". And so i did. And oh boy, was i disappointed. Now as with every show, i go in with reasonable low expectations, hoping to be pleasantly surprised later. In this case i sure wasn't.
First, and most important problem - complete lack of originality. Most people gain super powers at some point (boy, have never seen this one!). The protagonist isn't only in the minority who don't have powers, but is also physically weak (underdog? yep, for
                  the millionth time). School setting? DOUBLE FUCKING CHECK (honestly at this point you'd think the Japanese have no other meaningful events in their life except school?). Need more? Ok, how about a sudden plot device to give him some kind of op power? You got it! But he can't control his power and needs to train? You bet! 
Now, as bad as this is, all of those wouldn't be enough to bring down a show if it was still any kind of good. But its not nearly the end of the problem! First of all - the progression is awful (something that is seen in the shounen genre quite often, especially those that have a lot of characters due to attention division). Second of all - most of this season was spent on introduction dialogues and common stuff, so obviously it will be quite a boring watch, with the only exception probably being the past couple of episodes, and in a show with a measly 12 episodes (at least this season)..? Yeah, no good. The art and sound are decent, but the story is extremely mediocre (and again, completely unoriginal - underdog trains to become the strongest, random group of villains attack here and there for no reason other than being bad (at least give them a financial intensive from time to time or something? jeez!)), and most the characters are flat and boring. Add in the lack of action and flashiness and you get a very unimpressive combo.
Final verdict - would probably not suggest this title to anyone except kids, big shounen fans and people new to the medium.",5,mkzxwing

                A mildly entertaining watch, but nothing more than that. Boku no Hero Academia is a type of series that isn’t anything beyond just one more fighting anime and one that follows common aspects of the genre as if they were rules. There is an ambitious protagonist with a dream, his mentor and a strange world where people have peculiar abilities/powers. Even though more series fit that description, what makes them different is what they add to the formula and not how well they follow it. In Boku no Hero Academia, there are few of those extra features and the one different aspect it has -
                  the setting - is made unimportant as the series progresses. 
In the world of Boku no Hero Academia, 80% of all people have some special kind of ability. It became so common, in fact, that the 20% remaining are now the unusual ones and unfortunately the protagonist is among them. What sets this setting apart from others is how the protagonist has no prospect of growth. The power he wants to become a hero (like so many people in this world now are) is not something he can train on his own to obtain. He was simply not born with it, and there is, at first, nothing he can do about it. This aspect alone goes against most of the shounen of the same kind: while the message is usually that one only needs to work hard to achieve their goals, the frustration of someone with an innate difference is not so common of a theme. In a strange way everything seems to be a big deceit when the protagonist acquires a special power anyway, meaning that what was apparently established in the first episodes is not what the anime meant to explore at all. In the end it seems that the show reinforces the idea that the only way to success is to be like everyone else.
For the time being, though, the protagonist finda a way to achieve his dream. Because he has a starting point -- a power -- he can go to the same school the hero he admires went to. Since the protagonist obtained his power a short while before the entrance exams and taking into account the training he had before them, it all seemed to be leading to this point. Getting into this “academy” comes off as a necessity for the story to introduce shounen conventions and not for the growth of the protagonist. Even though the academy is an important point in the story (it is in the title itself, after all), the way the protagonist gets there shows that the will of the story shapes the will of the characters and not the other way around. 
However, if we leave the characters to the side for now, this part of the series is not all that bad. If you like battle shounens, then you will (probably) like the battle shounen aspects of Boku no Hero Academia. There is the typical test characters need to pass and the training they have to go through after they pass that test. The test is interesting because it is the first time we get to see how the protagonist uses his power and likewise the training shows how the protagonist will handle its use once he comprehends its limitations. The fights that follow are often creative when it comes to the protagonist’s tactics, although all the other characters seem to only rely on the strength of their powers to win. The fights are one of the things the Boku no Hero Academia did well and they are what accounts for most of the anime’s enjoyment factor. The downside to them is that because of characters that only follow stereotypes or strange relationships between those characters (for example, the protagonist admiring a guy that ceaselessly bullies him) the fights are much less intense because there is no real, personal conflicts when they do happen. When characterization and setting fail, everything is left to the action and the story. 
The problem with the story is when it is rendered meaningless, not only because of bad characterization, but mainly because the show demonstrates inconsistencies from the very beginning, as was the case with the story’s setting. Although this is only one side of the anime, inconsistencies negatively affect any show. If the viewer cannot count on the anime to be well-structured, there is no room to analyze anything beyond maybe an action sequence looking nice. It is not clear what Boku no Hero Academia is trying to do and any guess is futile since the dots that should be connected keep moving around. The outcome of any situation becomes irrelevant and the enjoyment is left to the most superficial parts of the show to carry, such as action sequences. But in the end, if  you like this type of show and are simply looking for enjoyment, not minding if it does not go too much beyond that, then Boku no Hero Academia is a good one to watch.",4,Vousz

                I dont understand how yall can enjoy this show when all the main character does is cry, its a huge cringe fest it literally hurts me to watch through each and every episode. WHY does this need to be cringe and filled with awkward ass moments. Then they have this gravity girl quirk person that pops up and adds even more cringe. (Spoiler ig?) The main character has a quirk aka ability and when he flicks his fingers he breaks them because hes weak as all hell. He will NOT stop crying afterwards and its a pain to hear a young child screaming and moaning
                  because he broke his god damn fingers lol. If you dont mind a cringe fest the fighting is at least alright. Would i recommend this? Definitely not.",1,Forlornness

                Another superhero anime? Why do they have so many of these coming out now? I thought One Punch Man was satisfying enough; somewhat unbeatable so why do they even bother with this genre anymore?
Oh boy, was I wrong.
This anime was in the top spot for a while now, three episodes were already out and I had not watched a single one. The anime fandom was raving for more episodes and spreading the word of how good it was. My mind was so fixated over the beautiful animation portrayed by One Punch Man that I refused to believe My Hero Academy was anywhere near as good;
                  I told myself it was a waste of my time and to study for my exams.
No, the frustration of not procrastinating right was unbearable. I grabbed my laptop and made it 10 minutes into the first episode before I closed the screen and told myself ""what garbage"", there's no absolute plot. Ah, I want to take my words back. Every anime has its pros and cons, comparing this anime to others does not do it justice.
Seeing the world from a young person's eyes, their dream and aspirations; it reminds us of what we strive for as well. Though shown differently, you can sympathise with the main character, teaching us a valuable lesson that if you work hard for something that you want, one day through luck and dedication your reward will be worth it.
A seed requires patience and love to grow; all that time waited for the fruit to ripen suddenly seems worth the effort. We are like this as well, give it a little time.",8,Pearlonthesea

                 For all the reviews I am going to do,I am gonna keep them short and straight to  the point. I know I don't like when a review just rambles on about nothingness or a minor part of the whole anime. 
  So here for ""Boku No Hero Academia"" Produced by Bone Studios, known for Fulmetal Alchemist Brotherhood mostly, is a gorgeous, fun, uplifting, and inspiring anime. Many would say the story is generic. It is about a small weak main character who magically starts to be on the upcoming by some miracle event as the episodes goo on. Now, don't get me
                  wrong I did say generic, but generic isn't always bad!! I absolutely love this style of anime. In fact, this is to me the most inspiring kinds of stories. I mean who doesn't love this stuff!?!  
The story to me is easily a ten. With the amazing idea of ""quirks"" and super powers really taking a stronghold for this anime. What made this story kind of unique was that the main goal of students was not to just go out and fight crime, but to get accepted into the best super hero school. Super hero school ? Some might say that is a bit corny, I actually agreed with that when it was first mentioned. But as later in the season shows, the tests these students go through are really intriguing. It shows the depth of the characters, the drive, their ambition, their heart, and their will to fight evil. It wasn't just some reading or writing, it was full on mental and physical anguish these student characters went through once in the school and during the tryout. Now yes there are some plot holes in the story (which I'm not going to spoil as you can see i haven't said specific characters). However, I know for a fact these will be filled up as the next season comes out and peaks my interest all over again.  
Art: Not to much to talk about. To me just normal 2015-2016 anime art. Which obviously is gorgeous, but nothing unique or extraordinary. I did love the colors in some scenes. During certain scenes the art played an UNREAL role is setting the mood. Really making the viewer feel what they were supposed to feel. 
Sound: Soundtrack was SOOOO IMPORTANT. I mean the anime is all about superheros right??? This anime had to have a good soundtrack or something would of been missing for the viewer right away. The music was so preicise with the scene it was mind blowing. I would think of music in my head as the scene was going on and then BAM! The music was playing perfectly with the scene. The sounds were great too. Well matched with the movements of the fights, explosions, punches, kicks, breathing, everything. ANNNND THE VOICES. I watched both the dub and sub. Now let me just say wow the dub was excellent. Every character had a beautifully matched voice. Congrats to all the voice actors. 
PS:  It was a combined superhero/anime music. I dont know how to put it. WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF IM SORRY ITS HARD. 
Character: 10 easily. No doubt about it. Here I am gonna go into some detail but no spoiler I promise. 
Izuku Midoriya: The main character in this anime. He is a very emotional young fellow who seems to really make you feel his emotions with every word and action he says or does. The viewer really does nothing but support him throughout the whole anime. Wishing the best for him and hoping he achieves everything he wants to. Extremely like-able and incredibly genuine. What a great character. YOU JUST WANT TO JUMP OUT YOUR SEAT AND ROOT FOR HIM THE WHOLE ANIME.
All Might:  I mean wow. He is a very love able character as well. Even makes you laugh a bunch throughout the series. I would say that if it wasn't for him cracking jokes, having a great personality, and genuinely caring for the people who fights for, he would seem extremely cocky and unlike able. But all those traits make you hop on the All Might train whenever he is kicking ass. He compliments Izuku well, showing how rare and uncommon Izuku's traits are. Making him the true main character we all love thanks to All Might.
Katsuki Bakugou: I really do not know how to put him into words. He is an arrogant, self centered, egotistical, spoiled, jerk, over the top, and cocky character. But....but.... somehow, you still like him....because of how cool he and his quirk is. He is such a good fighter, his quirk is honestly awesome, and he just knows how to use his body in fights so well. I really don't like any bullies in anime. In fact, I usually hate their guts. However (sigh) I still like Katsuki. The vibes he gives off when he fights just makes your jaw drop. He is so damn powerful and you just want to see him show his true potential and win every time he fights. His anger is off the charts. Katsuki explodes at any slight comment and its quite hilarious. One of my favorite scenes derives from him being so angry.  Hopefully his personality changes DRAMATICALLY in the next season. YEA RIGHT. (There are tons of characters so I did the top 3). 
Enjoyment: I'm keeping this short. I mean I put a 10 for a reason right? I enjoyed this anime so much. At the end of the last episode I went outside and ran 10 miles since I was so motivated. I love inspiring anime and this was nothing but pure enjoyment since the first ten seconds of the first episode. 
Overall: 9. This anime is phenomenal but no masterpiece. Masterpieces are rare and this one was very close to it. Can't wait for the next season.
Thanks for reading. I will be doing a lot more on a lot of different anime's. Not just popular ones! Thanks :)

                 About 2 days after April 3rd, I saw a title that held a high rank in the popular section of the anime site I use. The animations for this title, was different than what I typically see. Despite some skeptical first thoughts, I clicked the title and began to watch the first episode. I am so thankful that I did so. 
Boku no Hero Academia is an amazing story. The Quirkless boy, Izuku Midoriya, tries to defy societies restriction. Izuku is an ambitious dreamer, but every since he was young society said his dreams to become a Professional Hero were without base and unrealistic.
                  Though they're opinions are justified, Izuku just couldn't give up on his dreams. He storms after his dreams, and eventually meets All Might. Here, Boku no Hero academia peels away from the clichés. Battle after battle, physical or psychological, Izuku fights through them. That's what I really loved about Boku no hero academia, even though he faced many obstacles in getting admitted into U.A high school, the battles don't end there. He needs to continue to work hard and show that he is worthy of being in a top school. That's where the real fight begins in chasing his dreams to become a top hero. “I have to work a lot harder than other people!” Izuku is aware of where he stands; he’s at the bottom and barely making it through the hero training. Instead of being discouraged, he decided to work harder! Every struggle Izuku fights through, his tears of hard work, his face of disappointment, all of these moments, I as the watcher feel it as though I am right by his side. And every time Izuku succeeds with the amazing OST playing in the back, I want to go fight my own battles (figuratively). After every Sunday of watching the newly released episode, I felt really pumped to work my hardest for the coming week. I wanted to run even harder, I love Boku no Hero Academia because it inspires me to work harder toward my very ambitious dreams and goals. As Izuku surges forward, I realized that truly, success will shine through with enough hard work. 
The music in Boku no Hero Academia is magnificent. The OST is able to capture the mood perfectly and made me feel like yelling ""Ganbatte!"" I love the ending song because it sums up the hard work expressed in Boku no Hero Academia into a rhythmic beat. Listening to the song makes me feel that I want to “go beyond!” The opening took sometime to grow on me but it, too, is upbeat and I think that it expresses the tone in Boku no Hero Academia nicely. 
I have to say that I love Kaachan, All Might, Aizawa, and Izuku but I wish they spent more time on other characters. They do introduce all of Izuku's classmates but half of them I can't even remember their names, let alone their quirks. Some of them I forgot about their existence until the final episodes. They make all the classmates quite intriguing so it was a bit disappointing that they didn't invest as much time in the characters as I had hoped. I understand that it is a class of about 20 students, however there were few characters that naturally got more screen time (especially in the final arc) like Todoroki, Kirishima (I think was the guy's name), and Yaoyorozu (I just had to search her up to find out her name). These characters deserved more time than they were given but perhaps they are given that time in the original manga series. 
Overall, I loved Boku no Hero Academia because it is funny and weird but it definitely ignited a flame in me that makes me want to work even harder in almost everything that I do! Boku no Hero Academia teaches the resolve of making your dreams come true requires that you keep the flame of hope alive, then work hard to run after your dreams because that's how dreams come true; through the essence of hard work.",9,TheRisingH3R0

                I was just randomly scrolling through MAL and I came across a 8.20 something score for My Hero Academia. I soon as I saw it I needed to instantly right a proper review for this trash series. My Hero Academia is one of the most boring sleep-inducing, corny anime I have ever seen. Brings nothing new or unique in any way. Its as if the author said hmm I wonder what cliche shounen series I should make. Oh, yea I know lemme make the setting of my story have superpowers called quirks ""cause that's totally not a cliche name"". Next ill adds just a bunch
                  of mindless fighting and a school cause hey why not.
Story(-10) The story is set with everyone being born with quirks ill just refer to them as superpowers because just how stupid that sounds. Being a superhero is a career in this world. Our main character was born without any superpowers, but still wants to be a hero, he wants to try with determination, never giving up and things will come my way. Then you think hmm cool perhaps this would be like a batman thing were batman has zero powers and is a cool hero that fights villains without any powers but does that happen NOOOO. The author is so lazy to make to the story he just gives him powers. The series just loses the coolest thing about it. As soon as I saw this I knew what kinda show we were dealing with, just ur average shounen trash that we have seen 1 million times. Then he just goes to school like in every other shounen gotta have the school. Its a very predictable poorly written trash that everyone likes to hype up.
Characters(-50) The characters are awful the main character looks like the biggest loser I have ever seen. He's just ur average whiny, crying, scared of his own shadow kind of a character. zero character development or depth. 
Final thoughts: Character designs are one of the worst I have ever seen, its as if the illustrator gave a pen to a four-year-old and said draw me an anime.  The story and the characters gave me brain cancer. The fights arent good. This proves that anime is just falling more and more these days and how appalling most are. BUT people always hype up garbage and say well if this guy is hyping it up I should too. This anime is only for casual anime fans that have no idea what a good anime is.",2,Fierrza

                I have a decent impression with the series when I see the images because the design are really good the animations is really good is bones is a teen shonen  simple premise What can be wrong?
Starting overview :
ART&SOUND :
As I said the production  is good ONLY GOOD
STORY&CHARACTERS
The premise is simple  like a most shonen a city with superpowers is all , but the story want to make this simple premise more deep with moral speeches and don't work also  
the EASY SIMPLE BASIC PREMISE and the story add some little thing then the EASY SIMPLE BASIC PREMISE  DON'T MAKE SENSE
                  . A kid want  be a hero  but he don't  have powers  so, he needs to effort to make big things this is a conflict that even kids cartoons show take. BUT IS A  WAY TO MAKE  A POWER UP AND HAVE POWERS   so what is really the message know....... 
the protagonist is the same as most shonens (stupid) they have moral speeches begin annoying after the first speech  also is a rival  is a jerk & bad  that's really all.... the rival all person in the show said that he is cool but why? because jerk = badass i guess? is only there for  make the protagonist good 
there is other characters but a  really only to make a joke and don't do relevant 
CONCLUSION - 4/10
BAD
Characters are annoying and irrelevant the story is stupid and  is MORAL FAG",4,DOWA

                (If you're looking for a heartwarming story about a young boy trying to  defy all odds and become a hero, along with a bit of comedy, cute moments, and friendship...then this is for you!)
● Story: The story is good.The story isn't anything special, but the way it plays out is different from your usual 'becoming a hero' story. I like it; it's rather nice.
● Art:  The art is good. The art style is a bit weird. It's interesting to look at, yet it can become weird-looking at times. So, if you don't like different art styles like this then you might not like
                  sitting through this.
● Sound: The sound is very good. The voice acting is clear and dynamic. The soundtrack could use more, because I swear they played the same two/three sounds over and over.
● Character: The characters were great. The characters were very interesting, but many didn't get a lot of development like other animes like Assassination Classroom did with their characters.
● Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime until the last episode. I was filled with joy by the ending on episode 13. I hope the second season comes soon!

                The Details: My Hero Academia (Boku no Hero Academia) is an action/shonen anime based on a manga by Kohei Horikoshi. The anime ran for 13 episodes during the Spring 2016 season. 
(Contains mild spoilers)
The Story: In a world where most of the population has superpowers (called Quirks), Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya has always dreamed of becoming a great hero. There's just one problem: he doesn't have any powers of his own. But after a chance meeting with All Might, the greatest hero in the world, he might just get the strength he needs to overcome the odds and become the hero he's always wanted to be.
                  
The Good Stuff: 
-Okay, you'll pretty much know exactly where this story is going if you've ever watched a shonen series or a superhero movie. Despite that, it's still really well executed. You can have an amazing premise and not do anything worthwhile with it (*cough*SAO*cough*), or you can have a played-out, somewhat cliched premise that you work with and get something that, if not all that original, is still really good, and My Hero Academia 
does a great job at this. 
-I really like most of the characters. Izuku is a bit of a crybaby, but he keeps pressing on despite the fact that nearly everyone expects him to fail at first, and he actually shows some decent tactics and strategy when it comes to the fights he gets into. All Might is awesome, and his relationship with Izuku is rather touching and has some very sweet moments, especially at the beginning of the series. Iida and Uraraka are also very easy to like (and in Iida's case, hilarious). My favorite side character is probably Tsuyu, who I really want to see more of, thanks to her unique power and laid back personality. 
-The opening theme is catchy and fun. 
-The art is colorful and nice to look at, and I liked the unique character designs. 
-The final fight scene at the end with the villains was awesome. Parts of it reminded me of One Punch Man. 
The Bad Stuff: 
-Bakugou. I really didn't like him. He seems to be set up as a rival to Izuku, but since Izuku isn't all that powerful yet, he usually just comes across as a bully. He's made slightly more bearable by the fact that some of the other characters do make fun of his less desirable character traits, and he does get a couple of cool moments in the last few episodes, but that doesn't change the fact that he was pretty insufferable for most of it.
-There's a lot of buildup and not much payoff. Especially glaring are a couple of episodes in the middle of the series where not much important happens (episode 5 was probably the worst one in this regard). Granted, the last few episodes were really cool, but I did spend a fair amount of the series wondering when the plot was going to take off. 
-The soundtrack was kind of forgettable, as was the ending theme. 
-The villains that came in at the end were a little flat. Can't fault this too much, as they are being set up for bigger and likely badder things, but aside from their cool powers, they were kind of generic. 
-The ending left a lot hanging. 
Final Verdict:
""Fun"" is probably the best way to describe My Hero Academia. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking to be found here, but it has some cool fight scenes, some likable characters, and a pretty neat world.",7,TheTalkingTree

                My Hero Academia is the latest in terms of ultra-popular shonen, ranking #25 in MAL's most watched at the time of writing this review. With a variety of friends who have watched the series or read the manga plus the fact that unlike some other shonen it is of actually reasonably watchable length. And so I picked it up recently.
The plot of My Hero Academia is pretty simple and straightforward, with main character Midoriya (or as some others refer to him as a nickname, Deku) being a person without superpowers (""Quirkless"", with powers being known as Quirks) in a world full of them. Nonetheless he
                  aspires to be a superhero and idolizes the top hero of the world, the all american All Might (seriously, his attacks are named after random states/cities in America, and it is hilariously great)! Midoriya is about to give up hopes on the possibility when a chance encounter with All Might leads to a series of events that leads to All Might deciding to pass on his Quirk to Midoriya as his successor, for his is a nearly unique quirk that can be passed on to others...and All Might's time as a hero is nearing its end.
All in all, the setup ends up rather standard, but the standout character of All Might helps push it along: All Might's pondering on how a career he built so much is coming to an end, passing it off to someone who he finds worthy for their morals over their power and struggling with how he has such a large instinct to help people when he no longer can as easily do and his thoughts on having an icon of justice are pretty much all the most interesting parts of the first season. Both of his designs are quite good, although I am surprisingly partial to his normal form, with his All Might costume and design looking like it jumped right out of an American comic book which also helps really establish the tone.
Midoriya getting into the hero academy of the title leads to a host of side and semi-main characters with their own wacky powers and so on, although the first season primarily focuses on setting up for later seasons by introducing its quirky cast and what will obviously be recurring villains: About 3 of them are semi-mains who get focus as Midoriya's friend group, while the rest are relegated to more one note side characters for the moment. Some of them are really obviously going to be important in the future, Todoroki being the most obvious, while some are clearly just gag characters, like Yuuga or the awfil Mineta. In general, I would say a weakness of these characters is that the introduction of so many makes them quite one note at the start, even for the more prominent Ochako and Iida.
Bakugo, Midoriya's...""friend"" from childhood and school who also got into the academy is the rival character of this show and a character I am iffy on. Quite frankly with how Bakugo interacts with Midoriya I have no idea how we are supposed to buy into the idea Bakugo and Midoriya are actually friends, with Bakugo telling Midoriya to kill himself, repeatedly threatening to kill him and blowing up his stuff. Yeah, sure, they were friends as kids, they repeatedly flash back to Midoriya and Bakugo at four years old with Midoriya getting messed up by him. And he still was friends with him for over a decade? Nobody's parents intervened or anything? It isn't like Bakugo is subtle. Yes, Midoriya does at times talk about Bakugo's flaws but those are for the most part glossed over. I simply can't buy into the idea of them as friends and the rivalry stemming from it seems odd. Bakugo is also pretty one note in the first season with the vast majority of his scenes either being ""superiority complex"" or ""explosions"".
I am also going to take a moment of my time to say that Mineta, one of the minor heroes, is a truly terrible character in his limited screentime and should be kicked to the curb posthaste. He has two roles in this series: To be the one who makes pervy ""jokes"" + pervs on the girls and to be an overly loud, whiny ""hero"" who panics and is useless. These two traits combine to make a character who does nothing of value except unfunny jokes that often hurt the scenes he is in: His ""cowardly"" characterization in parts of the end of the season with Midoriya and Tsuyu stood out to me especially for hurting the atmosphere of the scene and lowering their quality notably. He also looks more like a child and his superhero outfit has what I would best describe as a diaper look to the pants, so you can tell this is just a parade of awfulness. Replacing Mineta's unfunny comedy antics in the finale's parts with an actual character to give us insight into them would have been a significantly better use of time than this waste of a character.
The plot is fine for what it is, since most of it is setup and we do get some good All Might stuff. While the pace is solid, I feel it would have been perhaps better served paring down the cast a little and giving a touch more focus to the ones they did have. The appearance of the villains in this season are kind of out of nowhere, but it works well enough and sets them up for the future seasons (can I just make a minor complain it annoyed me that the one team predominantly headed up by the women students was the only one that didn't definitively beat their villains?).
One thing I have to talk about and it does make the pace feel off is that this show has waaaaaaaaaaaaay too many flashbacks. The Midoriya/Bakugo fight in particular has a multitude of flashbacks that beat the same point in, sometimes being flashbacks to the same thing earlieri nt he episode (I assume to bring to speed people who didn't see it due to tuning in mid-episode/after commercials?), that really end up taking you out of the scene and feeling rather jarring. Cutting down on these flashbacks and using them better, for example giving more to Ochako and Iida instead of all the Midoriya flashbacks, would improve the plot.
Graphically, the show looks quite good: The characters are extremely expressive, All Might's unique shading really helps give pop to his character and make him look like a larger than life hero, the use of a lot of powers is well animated, I'm no expert in this kind of thing but I thought it overall looked pretty good. Sometimes though the faces really went too far, which either made them unpleasant or difficult to take seriously or otherwise kind of warped...I'm not sure how to put it, but sometimes it was too dramatic, other times it just looked funny. The VAing and sound is mostly solid: I may be the only person on the planet who doesn't especially care for MHA Season 1 or 2' OPs, but the background music is good but not something that jumped out to me. The voice acting is a bigger point in its favor, like Tsuyu, All Might and Bakugo's. Mineta's VAing was so good at playing the character's annoying traits to their appropriate annoyance that it only makes it easier to hate him.
My Hero Academia is not a shonen you watch because it is especially innovative, but it IS rather fun with enough to it to keep it from feeling vapid. Reviewing only the first season is awkward, and it is best to know going into this show that the first season is mostly there as a big introductory fest with the exception of All Might. I would generally recommend it to people who are predisposed to this kind of show given the strong visuals, enjoyment of fights and unique designs and the fact it has high potential to build on what it has made in the first season...but I also wouldn't say it super impressed me or that it is a show I would be especially trying to get people who aren't especially into this genre to watch for its quality. The primary thing it has is being enjoyable: The show is rarely dull and thus keeps the viewer invested.",6,FrozenRoy

                ~Multilingual review, English & Español~
The thing I hate the most about anime is when the writers think you're an idiot and they explain everything to you (even though most of the times they are pretty obvious things), feeling the need to make a flashback to things that happened THREE MINUTES EARLIER.
If you make these kinds of things eight times per episode, mix it with one-dimensional and archetypical characters, overused themes, pedophile fanservice (for Christ sake Ochaco Uraraka is fifteen years old, couldn't you restrain your urges of making her heroine-suit so tight???). Every episode is a different tournament, the plot is just dreadful, the villains
                  are....well, lets just say that the villains don't have really strong motivations behind their acts, and even with that, the series insist in making it an absolute Good and Evil thing, it's just the same kindergarten Manichaeism we have seen a thousand times before, booooooooooooring. If you blend all these things, you will obtain Boku No Hero, a major bluff that makes me wonder why people hold it in such high regard.
Now let's talk about Bakugo. Wtf. It's the most annoying character of them all (and this show is full of lame, silly and annoying characters making lame, silly and annoying ""comedy""). I believe the teachers had a meeting to decide if Bakugo should be accepted into the Academy and it went like this: ""are we really going to train a boy which is clearly unstable and short-tempered, full of hate and showing a lot of the traits of potential villains? OF COURSE WE ARE, AND WE ARE GOING TO GIVE HIM TWO GRENADES TO COVER HIS ARMS THAT CAN EXPLODE AND DESTROY BUILDINGS, HELL YES"". Not even a doubt? A psychological test to determine if he is fit to become a hero? Without a psychological treatment to understand and fix his anger issues and his inferiority complex disguised as superiority complex? Because all, ALL he says is AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH DEKUUUUUUUUU IM STRONGEEEEEEEEER DIEEEEEEEEEE. I don't know, but there's plenty red lines there.
And yes, the other characters are really lame, annoying and not funny. As an example I'm thinking about that grape-head kid, an annoying perv that makes you wish you've had never ever watched any episode of this show.
La cosa que mas odio del anime es cuando se cree que eres tonto y te tiene que explicar absolutamente todo, haciendo flashbacks a cosas que han ocurrido tres minutos antes.
Si haces esto ocho veces por capítulo, lo juntas con personajes unidimensionales y arquetípicos, temas manidos, fanservice pedófilo (Ochaco Uraraka tiene 15 años, a que vienen ese traje de heroína tan apretado???) , que cada capítulo sea un torneo, argumento xd, villanos con motivaciones ridículas y maniqueísmo de preescolar (has robado una cartera?? claramente eres la encarnación del Mal Absoluto), te queda Boku No Hero, una serie muy mediocre que hace que me pregunte por qué la gente la tiene en tan alta estima.
Ahora hablemos de Bakugo. Wtf. Es el personaje más molesto de todos (y este espectáculo está lleno de personajes estúpidos y molestos que hacen una ""comedia"" cutre, tonta y molesta). Creo que, para decidir si Bakugo era aceptado en la Academia, los profesores tuvieron una reunión y dijeron algo así: ""¿Realmente vamos a entrenar a un niño que es claramente inestable e irascible, lleno de odio y que muestra muchos de los rasgos de un villano potencial? POR SUPUESTO QUE SÍ, Y LE VAMOS A DAR DOS GRANADAS COMO BRAZOS QUE PUEDEN EXPLOTAR Y DESTRUIR EDIFICIOS, CLARO QUE SÍ"". ¿Ni siquiera dudaron? ¿Le hicieron una prueba psicológica para determinar si es apto para convertirse en héroe? ¿No creen que va a necesitar un tratamiento psicológico para entender y arreglar sus problemas de ira y complejo de inferioridad camuflado como complejo de superioridad? Porque todo lo que dice es AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH DEKUUUUUUUUUU SOY MUCHO MÁS FUERTE QUE TUUUUUUU MUEREEEEEEE.
Y sí, los otros personajes son realmente patéticos, molestos y no graciosos. Como ejemplo, estoy pensando en ese niño cabeza de uva, un pervertido que te hace desear no haber visto nunca ningún episodio de este producto.",3,rotlaust

                ""Heroes aren't born, they're made...""
This quote captures the very essence of this anime. Now I have seen a lot of superhero animations, but this one is one of a kind, for it does not just show off the superpowers of the hero, it inspires us than anyone can be one if you have the heart for it.
The way the plot of this anime is presented is so perfect that you don't see any flaws. No one's OP, everyone has a weakness. Even the powerful Allmight has a weakness. But that doesn't stop him from being the symbol of peace. From this, we can understand why
                  the MC, Midoriya, admires him so much. Being able to keep on fighting even if all odds are against you is something we can be proud of. That is the very message of this anime, one which Midoriya learned as he makes himself a hero.
The expressions portrayed by the characters are those we can definitely feel. Perhaps it is because we have all been in that same situation: being pushed down, being told that you can't be what you want to be. But it is through this ordeal that we must stand up and prove them wrong. Even if we weren't born with the talent, we just have to strive to make ourselves be better versions of ourselves in order for us to reach our dreams.
The art and sound further expressed the mood and atmosphere of each scene. By combining these elements do we feel the emotions displayed on screen. Truly, it is a beautiful anime with a beautiful message.
I recommend this to everyone, especially those who have fallen in the dark shades of reality. It's never too late to stand up, never too late to reach your dreams. This is YOUR hero academia.",9,Vaenny

                Synopsis: 
A new phenomenon has appeared among mankind. 80 percent of the population possess superpowers known as “Quirks”, and this gave birth to the rise of heroes and villains. Being a hero has always been high school student Midoriya Izuku’s dream, and All Might, the greatest hero of all, is his all-time inspiration. Unfortunately, Midoriya learns that he possesses no Quirks and is fated never to become a hero at all. One day, he gets rescued by none other than All Might himself after being attacked by a villain. Little did he know that on that fateful day, he learned All Might’s deepest secret, one
                  that would change his life forever and what it means to follow All Might’s footsteps.
Pros: 
I. The characters are earnest, down to earth, and lovable.
A. Midoriya 
Midoriya is one character who shows what being a hero really means. Born without any Quirks, he gets a opportunity of a lifetime. With hardwork and dedication he his able to achieve his childhood dream of becoming a recognized hero, like his idol All Might. Literally brought me to tears watching him grow as a character. He deserves respect.
B. Bakago  
Bakago is not a one dimensional rival. The relationship between Midoriya and him is explored; from childhood to the present.
II. Nobody is overpowered 
When I say nobody I mean nobody, not even the super beast All Might.
III. Emotion
The reason why the characters are likable is because their personalities are explained, which makes them feel genuine.
Cons:
I. Cast size/Screen time
Character development is the anime's greatest strength but just for a few a them. Not everyone is fully developed, even important characters like the main villain. Simply put there too many characters and just too little episodes. 
II. Weird pacing
The first half is kind of slow being all about Midoriya training and trying to become a hero. While the second half is high paced action, fighting real villains. Would have been better if it was maybe 26 episodes but it did officially get a 2nd season in 2017 which I am hype to see.
III. Cliche-ish
The story is the basic herose versus villians.",8,Akilleez

Boku no Hero Academia is a Shonen anime adaptation of the Manga holding the same name. It takes place in a sort of X-Men like universe where humans are developing various powers except a lot of the powers are a little more silly than most Marvel mutants (looking at you tape elbow man) and in Boku no Hero something like 95% of the population has powers so it's kind of the opposite ratio to X-Men.
Boku no Hero is a unique Shonen anime in that it
                  adheres to almost every generic trope that Shonen media has to offer, but the way its characters are established as well as the setting being a kind of western comic book-esque 
universe fits the feel perfectly and serves to benefit the story rather than play itself out and feel boring. 
(Disclaimer; If you are an avid consumer of the genre than maybe you didn't feel this way.)
All that talk about adherence to tropes aside the main character Deku feels unique in that we are shown his struggle to better himself. He doesn't just GET to be amazing, but is instead forced to give it his all in an attempt just to compete with the rest of his peers. He does so in an extremely realistic way with an actual depicted rigorous change of diet,exercise, and lifestyle that inspired me to live healthier and shows that results require dedication.
The other characters in the show are enjoyable with the typical love interest proving actually useful and just genuinely a delight of a character rather than a hollow shell. We get a good look into the mind of Bakugo our heroes rival and get an idea of what makes him tick. The supporting cast are for the most part all interesting and breed a lot of curiosity on what their powers are about and who they are as characters. Overall I was left wanting more of the world and the characters in it and when a show does that it's got you hooked for the long haul.  
The visuals in this show were amazing and I imagine it had an astronomically high budget, but even so it deserves mention that I can't recall seeing any CG. For an anime studio to not revert to cutting corners with CG especially with scene's involving lots of buildings and giant robots is fairly unheard of these days and will merit special recognition from me.
Boku no Hero Academia has established itself as the perfect example of a Shonen story done well. It is as of now my prime example for its genre and will stand above its peers as long as it doesn't start to betray itself as the series goes on like many long running Shonen shows are prone to do.
I came across Boku no Hero Academia post the hype of it's season as I was living under a rock at the time of it's airing so I feel my review is particularly unclouded by the hype it generated or the hate of said hype.",9,Moomochi

                I can't believe it but I actually enjoyed something with super heroes(Ok,I liked One Punch Man too...)I was tired of the same recipe those shows had and am glad that this anime is progressive without some Bam! I can do everything,just leave it to me!
Story(7/10)
All things considered,the story is average at this point because it's mostly an introduction to the real core of the plot.In a world full of people with ''Quriks'' and of heroes and villains,Izuku dreams to become someone like All Might,the symbol of peace.The problem is,he doesn't have any powers,just his intel on the heroes.One day when he tries to save his
                  childhood ''friend'' Katsuki(who always made fun of Izuku's powerlessness) he meets All Might.The hero thought too that Izuku didn't have any chance at his dream but after seeing his courage he atmits to it being possible.And so All Might reveals his real form and power and transfers to Izuku his power and hope.From there on it's pretty much training and the arrival of some uninvited guests and some cool fights.
Art(9/10)
I'm not so picky about things like animation and sound but I gotta say the characters' design looked quite unusual.The fight scenes looked pleasing along with all of the colorfulness.
Sound(8/10)
The opening and ending,while not being usually of my taste were surprisingly catchy and I found myself humming the songs several times.None of my favorite voice actors were in this but I liked the principal's voice,it sounded like Russia(Hetalia).
Character(8/10)
I liked most of the characters,they had all kinds of unique abilities.Izuku and All Might are the ones who I liked it most  because of their will to do everything in their power to assure the safety of their dear ones and the courage they show in the most dire times.I have to say that I disliked Kacchan because of his lack of care and egocentric tendencies.Yes,I get that he grew up thinking his Quirk was the best but he has to realise the world doesn't revolve around him.I just hope doesn't go to the dark side like Sasuke.
Enjoyment(8/10)
Shocking to me,I enjoyed this quite a lot except the fact that it all ended too quickly without getting to know all its Quirks.

It's good,yes,I would recommend it to anyone who likes super heroes and shounen anime",8,SixZeroSeven

                Boku no Hero Academia, a series I often poke fun of due to it sounding like Boku No Pico. Yes, how original....
Finally, after getting a ton of recommendation from my friends, I now then embark on the story of which is Boku no Hero Academia. Straight off the bat, I was super skeptical before going into this series, because from the look of it it seems as if this was just a plain shounen type kind of show and the only reason people adore it so much is due to the cute characters or funny scenes the show has to offer. And after watching this,
                  my predictions were right, the characters are somewhat cute and childish but I was more interested in the whole story. To start, I love how the show just throws the viewer into the world with short and understandable explanation of the world. It was a great start because it would definitely be a bore to go through how the world happen to be it. However, an issue quickly arose with the character Bakugou, from the first scene of him I was just instantly disappointed. Yes the show want present him as the rival to our main dude but the way the present his doings and all is absolutely horrible. This issue of characters can be seen throughout the show and is something the show really fails at. Majority of the characters are shallow and just mediocre, plus our main character is annoyingly emotional. Like seriously, does his eye duct have an issue of holding tears. I know the show explained how badly he was treated by society due to not having powers but I honestly find it terrible, like the show keeps trying to make it emotional and I feel this effected my whole experience. I hate hate hate it so much how hard the show tries to be emotional, pisses me off. This is something One Punch Man does right, balancing all the types of mood together. Another thing I absolutely hate was the villains, plain, boring and unoriginal. They remind me of the Micheal Jackson song 'Bad', 'I'm bad, I'm bad you know it'. While I accept and understands the villains intention the way the presented them is so poorly done. Like they talk bad, do bad, and overall just be bad for all the matters. There is no depth to them for me a viewer to like them or find them interesting, they are so two dimensional. I really am a sucker for a good villain but what Boku no Hero Academia showed was disappointing, plus the plot armor for the heroes are way too strong. It's like I do not even need to expect what is going to happen cause I already know the heroes will win. Honestly, the show wasn't that bad except for the part mentioned, it is a simple and plain story and if the studio executed it right I feel that this can be more enjoyable than it is now. Lastly and most importantly of all, the show lacks realism and what I mean by that is that there is not sense of reality in a world that is somewhat realistic. I hope you get where I am coming from cause this is a big issue, the whole show itself seems too scripted and fake. The characters act unrealistically in real life and thus it make them shallow to me. All I can hope for is the next few seasons to be better.
-SCORES-
Character- 6/10: All seem very fake and unrealistic, all except Mr Shouta Aizawa, that dude has that dead-life that is somewhat relatable. Villains suck which plays a super big Oof in the show all together.
Art- 8/10: I can definitely see the studio try to shorten the amount of screen time in each episode, examples of this is the being re-cap and all the reuse scenes of a flashback. But honestly, they can do as they please cause the fight scenes are swell and well. At least Bones knows where to put their priorities.
Writing- 5/10: Super straight forward and plain, not a lot of interest points to grab onto but I'm hopeful that it will get better in the next few seasons.
Sound- 7/10: Other than all the annoying emotional music, I say the OST is fine and fits the theme of the show.
Overall, I say there is potential. Definitely not as good as what my friends say but there is potential for this show to be great. This is just a personal wish but I hope there will be a third party that will enter between the good and the bad guys, I swear if that happens this would make the series way more interesting.

                Overall, the show's plot is very plain and boring. Although there was action, the characters didn't really have any personality and it was very predictable. Things that happened later on in the series were expected by most of the fans due to the nature of the writing.
The art was colorful and popped, however, the character designs were a bit plain. I did think that the art was cute though.
Music and sound-wise, I was pretty pleased. Aside from some annoying voices of the characters, the cast and soundtrack were actually really good. The opening and ending were both fitting for the type of show.
It is exactly
                  what you should expect for a vanilla shounen series if you are into that type of show. I didn't mind the show, but there are much better series that I've watched in the genre.",5,cosmiczxdia

                My Hero Academia.
Synopsis: My first thought of the anime was that the story was about a kid who appeared weaker than his peers. I have seen anime in where the weak character remains a weak character, and so I had assumed the worst that this anime would remain unappealing. I really thought, ""oh man, this kid is taking all of this garbage and not fighting about it. I'm not so sure about this anime.""
To add onto that, the jokes initially seemed overdone and horrific. I mean, for what reason would I laugh at a kid getting beaten down or insulted. That's complete garbage, but the
                  anime made light of it. What the anime didn't tell me was that this show has potential. What the anime didn't tell me at the time was that the weak can become the strong. That those who strive to be the best and learn from their mistakes can deal some serious justice in this world. It is not always about who starts off great, but who can adapt, and who can become someone that others look up to.
If you are following me in the previous two paragraphs, you will likely understand that there is a reason to enjoy this anime. There is a reason to enjoy the pursuit to become the best.
__________
Now this is all optimistic thinking. Surely everyone is glad and happy to see a superhero deal out some serious damage to baddies, but what about the folks that aren't super. This anime plays into that effect. This kid who was tormented. This kid that was insulted and shown almost no love was the same kid that did his homework. This same kid realized that to be the best, one had to study the best and that's what he did. In situations in-where he would normally lose, he relied upon his knowledge that he wrote down in books everyday about the heroes that he admired. What would they do? He did it. How would they handle the situation? He handled it.
Even if he felt afraid, he went for it.
___________
Why this anime may receive negative feedback. Certain characters have omega super powers. Please keep in mind that those powers have self-sacrifice involved and are not unlimited. 
The main character plays the nice guy who wants to save everyone. The main character refuses to show bias towards anyone else, thus making him very likable. Is it fault in the anime to deter the number one character from making emotional mistakes?
___________
If watching a motivating ""boys becomes hero"" anime tickles your fancy, here is why you should watch it.
Plot: 7/10 There is no real purpose for the plot, except it be a 'slice of life' plot line. Yes, sinister scenarios occur and turmoil supersedes the daily lives of heroes, but it's hard to figure out a well defined goal here.
Personas: 7/10 The main character is more or less explained about and in summary has a 'nice guy' type of personality. There are numerous other characters in this anime, some with more airtime than others, but the timeline gives the viewer ample time to really foreshadow any of the other heroes. I will note that most characters have distinct personalities.
Graphics: 9/10 Modern style art and graphics. Really well done. Goes the extra mile to demonstrate high frame scenes.
Soundtrack: 9/10 Incredibly motivating at times. Well placed within the scenes.
Voice Actors: 9/10 The Japanese actors had the typical tough guy voices on the strong characters and the lighter voices in smaller characters. Potentially stereotypical, but no complaints here. Much emotion.
Overall: 8/10
Recommended: Well worth it. Season 2 is coming out.",8,mrbeckham09

                So this was the first anime I ever watched like a year ago and I legitimately thought it was the best thing ever, and now I look back on that and cringe so hard. It's not as bad as the antis make it out to be, and not as amazing as the die-hard fans make it seem, it's just so...vanilla. After watching, like, three other anime, I quickly realized that the show wasn't the masterpiece that I initially believed it to be.
Pros:
-World-building is solid
-Soundtrack and OST's are good
-Many of the characters are actually pretty good (not all of them!)
-AMAZING for beginners
-Art is good
Cons:
-Super vanilla
-Cliche and
                  annoying MC
-Some plot holes/details that don't add up or make sense
-Pacing is kind of inconsistent
That's pretty much it. The show is just...meh. It's not flaming garbage, and it's not a masterpiece. In general, it's a fun, generally light-hearted that is good for younger fans/new weebs. It's just nothing special.",5,stormy-days
31964,"
                   Let's start with the world-building. Most of the world's population has received quirks, since the story is a set in a world similar to our own, how the hell hasn't society completely collapsed???? I know this is fiction but if you're going to make everything in the real world and the MHA world the same except with superheroes, you gotta be somewhat realistic on how society functions when 80% of the world now has superpowers. 
   Now let's get to One for All. The thing with Deku's power is that it feels too convenient. Of course Deku gets the super
                  ultra amazing special ability that no one else has when he just so happens to really want to be a superhero. I know some people wanted Deku to fight villains without any powers which would be cool since it would be more meaningful to the story, but wouldn't work due to the power scaling of the show. I think it would have been nicer if Deku received a normal power that maybe wasn't super powerful, not some super secret awesome ability like no other power. It would honestly fit better with the themes and would cure the show from ""super special main character"" syndrome. Honestly, Deku having a normal power would make the show seem more inspiring and less of a power fantasy.
(Also whats with everyone acting like All Might's powers are a big secret, it obviously has something to do with enhanced human ability, he has super strength or something lmao)
   The characters are bad. They're all stale one note pieces of cardboard. Deku is your classic shounen protagonist with the the classic goal of ""I wanna be the best [insert] ever"", at least he's hot-headed. The show acts like Deku is an amazing selfless brave hero when he does the bare minimum. All Might spends ages trying to find a successor for ""one for all"" and the person he finally finds and who he believes is worthy is some kid with a death wish and no powers who tried to save someone from a villain. The standards are really high on this one. Bakugo is the original childhood friend turned bully. Uraraka is the female protagonist only existing for the purposes of a romantic subplot. All Might is dying superman, Everyone else doesn't matter. Maybe the show will figure out what to do with the characters later on. 
   The show doesn't know how to handle a lot of characters. Sure you can have a lot of characters without making every single one of them deep and meaningful, Hunter x Hunter did that. But the difference between hunter x hunter and MHA is that the show puts focus away from the main characters in order the let the abundance of side character to shine. MHA wants to put focus on the main 4 constantly (Deku, Bakugo, Uraraka, All Might) while also wanting a load of side characters. MHA needs to learn how to balance.
*Spoilers ahead*
   Every episode is just class 1A dilly dallying consisting of test, Deku's monologues and Bakugo drama. All of this leads up to the final fight.  Oh what a mess this was. Because this is a shounen, of course it leads to a final big fight. Due to the show not knowing what it's doing, without any build up it just places a fight out of nowhere at the end of the season because shounen. A couple of villains break in to UA because of course they do and go to a training dome thing because that's where the main characters are. There's a lot of convenient situations that just happen so it would be easier for the mangaka to write. The villains are trash, their motivations are surface level, they are non threatening, shown by being defeated easily by a couple of teenagers in training. 
   What I will praise the show for is it's unique and amazing character designs and the fun art style. The animation isn't inventive but it's classic good shounen animation, nothing wrong with that.

                the amount of praise this amine gets is astronomical from fandom pages to countless cosplays to the cancerous fandom... oh my god the fandom...... now before I get into anything else I'm gonna start off by saying that my dislike for the majority of the fandom or my dislike for this anime doesn't really have to do with why I am writing this; I am solely writing this as I would just like to state how overrated this mediocre ( extremely average) anime really is. 
The problem that sticks out the most for me is how much this anime sucks Deku's little whiney ass. He's
                  the typical cliche wimp who gets picked on and is an outcast at the start of the story then becomes GOD; nothing special- I would ignore this factor more if they didn't make his personality so dislikable. Look I get even though he may be a wimp he was hard-driven and never gave up to have those powers but goddamn man not everyone in life is gonna get 'powers' so get over it. Also since the story sucks his ass soooo much he seems to be the only character with character development; none of the other characters get as much as he does. 
I only got up to episode 13?? but this is all i can say for how far i got .. it wasn't the worstttt but i don't get why such an average anime gets so much praise for nothing; even if it wasn't popular, my opinion would still remain the same.",5,sockonthisd

                Boku No Hero Academia
Where to even start…
Well I’d like to debut by saying that this review will be covering both seasons of the show. Although it has been confirmed that the series is to continue for yet another instalment, I seriously doubt it’ll change much of what will be said within this opinion piece. In a nutshell: Boku No Hero Academia just doesn’t cut it, for me at least, and I would like to explain my reasoning, so here goes: The reason why this series falls short is because it’s a shounen.
 -*Wait Vishi! Is that the only reason why you don’t like the show?!?*-
Ok,
                  ok…let me rephrase that…It’s a shounen eh!?!?
-*FacePalm*-
I say this because the shounen genre, in general, has this tendency to create an ever-expanding world setting that, in all honesty, requires a god-awful amount of time to anchor itself into place. Hero Academia, falls right into that molding but, regrettably lacks the time to flourish into something marvelous. Quite frankly, I don’t believe this show will garner the support needed to elongate its existence within the realm of anime. Put differently, I’m betting this show’ll sink after S3: and this will effectively prevent it from gaining momentum in its story telling.
Furthermore, the content being shown throughout is underwhelming, worsening its “raison d’être” and adding to my initial presentiments. Exceptions can be made, however, for the show’s first few episodes. More exactly, I’m talking (err typing) here about episodes one through four: they’re amazing! Basically, I fell in love with the start, grew tired of the rest. From the beginning, the series exposes us to an MC, hereby named Young Midoriya, who has this unrivaled admiration for all heroes: yup! The show’s about a boy living in a society that has professionalized the hero trade. Citizens, those whom have been chosen, are granted, from birth or during infancy, super-natural powers or “Quirks”; and most eventually find interest in using those abilities for heroic deeds by educating themselves into becoming “certified heroes”. Our MC is one such hopeful except, he lacks any sort of Quirk.
From this premise alone, we get to appreciate the unsurmountable challenges that Young Midoriya has had to face. It’s David versus 50 goliaths’ as our protagonist fights with two opposing forces within his very own being: The realist in him constantly urges the boy to give up on these foolish dreams of becoming a hero, while the dreamer inside simply can’t settle for anything else. This conflicting nature is addictive! I saw myself in him, I could relate: So, I was pulled in! Above all heroes he so vehemently fawned over, young Midoriya was most enamored with All Might: The number one hero in the world! So, although constantly reminded by what he lacked, our wannabe hero found solace in everything His idol embodied: serving as a symbol he could rally behind. At this point I’m just crying, because I saw this boy’s drive to become a better person, and lauded his eagerness to find his own definition of “what being a hero” truly meant.
Sounds good, right? Well it ends there. Seriously everything else is all just a big blur. Though I don’t have it in me to demean the continuance of the show post-Episode 4. I also don’t have anything to say about it that might encourage someone to start on this, if not for the beginning. The humor is monotonous. The atmosphere is always so quirky. Most villains (the antagonists if you will) are lame, both in character and quirk (although the last episode introduced some nice additions to the “bad guy(s)” category; alas they remain a mystery as the show didn't bother fleshing them out). The plot made us question so much, as curiosity requires, but does very little in answering anything as it progresses. I don’t know, I started losing faith mid-way through. The most annoying thing was when I started realizing that the MC was getting upstaged by a supporting character: Todoroki I’m looking at you honey - if you’re gonna try and steal little Mido’s shine you can just leave and make your own anime series. What a prick that guy. Okay… Take a breather Vishi, inhale and ex…hell maybe I did have it in me to demean Boku No. I’m sorry. Had to let it out.
Lastly, I didn’t appreciate how Hero Academia tried emulating Naruto’s chunin exam, and Dragon Ball’s martial arts tourney. The appropriation of ideas from other series is fine, but this was sloppy: the outcome being totally different from what those series tried depicting in their respective arcs, you got the feeling that the writers were trying to be clever with it, but failed miserably. I highlighted two examples, but sloppiness is a recurring theme here, taking away from my enjoyment of the overall work that is Boku No Hero Academia.",5,-Vishi-

                This show is good but nothing really stands out to me.  If I had to describe it I guess I would say it feels a lot like one punch man except the main character isn't an all powerful emotionless badass.  The story is okay and can provide some entertainment but there's nothing really great about it.  First few episodes were pretty effective in explaining the kind of world the characters live in as well as what the main character's dreams and obstacles are.  Midoriya Izuku, or Deku as he's called, wants to become a hero even though he was born with
                  no powers, or Quirk. In an amazing stroke of luck he meets his idol All Might, who is the greatest hero of all time.  All Might eventually decides to mentor Deku and gives him his very own Quirk.  This allows Deku to enroll in the greatest hero school of all time.  After he's allowed to attend the school of his dreams, the story kind of slows down.  I don't feel like anything is really at stake or anyone is going to die.  Even when we're specifically told that something terrible is going to happen I don't feel any real threat.  I wasn't even worried when the class had to take on a swarm of villains because I knew All Might and the rest of the heroes would show up to save the day.  By the end of the season I wasn't really interested in what new adventures the characters would eventually go through because I felt like everything would just turn out ok.  
Speaking of characters, most of them aren't even really that important or memorable. Midoriya, All Might, and Bakugo are pretty much the only ones who are given any sort of back story, personality, and goal.  Midoriya is a shy and weak boy with a good heart.  All Might is a great hero whose time is running short.  Bakugo is Deku's rival/bully/childhood friend who was constantly being praised about how great he was but hates Deku because he feels like Deku doesn't believe in what a god he is.  I'm really not sure if they want us to pity Bakugo or just straight out hate him because there are times where he is shown to be a complete asshole maniac who even tried to kill Deku at one point, and times where they show him to just be this misunderstood kid who still has a lot to learn and won't quit until everyone acknowledges him.  Everyone else, besides a couple of people, are pretty bland and forgettable.  It basically feels like the show wants us to identify most of the characters by their powers instead of who they are.  Hell, I still don't know the names of the majority of the class I just classify them by their abilities.
The art style is good and the animation can do some pretty impressive things during fight scenes which is always entertaining to see.
I like the music for the most part.  Opening theme is good and the closing sounds great.  Perhaps the one bit of music I'm not very fond of is All Might's theme whenever he shows up because it sounds way to cheerful.
I may have named a lot of flaws but I definitely am interested in seeing where this show goes next season.  The quirks are interesting and the story does hint that some serious shit is in the works.  The first season may not have gripped me into the story as much as it should have but I can't really blame it since it was only 13 episodes.  Given a little time and effort I do think the next season can be something great.",7,Firebolt13

There are not that many things wrong with this series. But there are simply things that cannot be overlooked.
I am actually amazed at how much of a bunch of fucking hypocrites anime fans are. This story has nothing original. We complain about Naruto and friends being cancer because ""they are not original"", yet the same people praise this anime as a masterpiece. Good job anime community. You did it again.
I cannot believe this anime is ranked #190. I can see at least why Re:Zero is ranked #64 but this, this does not deserve any kind of recognition. It's so FUCKING
                  GENERIC. 
I really like the characters designs and the art overall. All characters look different and you can tell a lot of effort went into designing them. The animation isn't bad, nothing outstanding.
I don't know why the world is so similar to ours when more than 80% of the population of Earth have super powers. Almost nothing has changed! 
Something that bothered me is how this show treats discrimination. It is revealed later in the series that if you are not born with super powers, you can acquire them. This isn't a good message for children. They contradict themselves multiple times. So like, if you are born without powers you can only acquire them? Not through hard work? Great. In Naruto they also make this mistake, but in Shippuden.
Overall this anime couldn't be more generic. It is enjoyable, but it does not deserve any of the hype. 1 dimensional characters. Unlikeable brats (Not that I have a problem with unlikeable characters, I do like the well written ones) and many plot holes. 
The only good thing about this series is All might.

                One of the more recent and popular Shounen JUMP titles, My Hero Academia comes to life in its well-deserved anime adaptation.
As said within the show itself, the story feels like something out of a comic book. While that's true, that mainly pertains to the very beginning, or in this case the first few episodes. Though, I can't say it's similar to other stories, because the show has a unique twist with how superpowers, or ""Quirks"" as they're called, work and put into practice. I should point out that the anime doesn't cover a whole lot from the original manga. Even if a second season has
                  been confirmed, I will admit how this season played out felt like there should have been more, like it could have had a second cour to it.
In this universe, 80% of the world's population have these different abilities. No doubt, we're going to see some ""quirky"" characters (I had to...) somewhere along the way. From the elite heroes to the students in training, we get an abundance of fantastic individuals that give the series its charm.
This season, I've seen wonderful cases of clean and consistent animation. My Hero Academia is no exception. Done by the ever popular studio Bones, they truly give the characters color and show great detail in the action sequences. It's almost as if it were an actual comic book come to life.
I began reading the manga not long before the anime's premiere, and eventually caught up by the last few episodes. Despite what I said about how much was adapted, I still feel that it was well done. It makes me look forward to the next season, which I wasn't expecting to be announced so soon. If you've got what it takes to be a hero, then check out My Hero Academia!",8,AllenHavens92

                I first ran into this anime from a YouTube video by jackontc, whom I knew from his One Punch Man theme recreation. The video was a recreation of You Say Run from the BnHA soundtrack, and I just had to find out what kind of anime would have such kick ass music in it. At the time, it was #1 for hottest new anime on KissAnime so I decided to go ahead and join the bandwagon...
This is a typical Shonen anime showcasing a plot device that a majority of anime fans should be very familiar with: the underdog story. Because of this, many people have
                  dropped or disliked this anime, and I don't blame them because it's good reasoning. Boku no Hero has its flaws, but it still deserves  justice. I really enjoyed watching it, and for many key reasons.
One, the plot is unoriginal, but it's NOT uninteresting. Countering its plot device, the developers did a great job on resisting the intent on making the storyline drag. I can easily compare this to Naruto Shippuden, which is what I basically describe as ""watered-down"" anime, or an anime that tries very hard to be good, but its execution is poor. Boku no Hero Academia fits into this category, but the execution is the complete opposite. This anime is exciting and a boatload of fun, which can easily outweigh unoriginality. I felt like I was being taken back to the good days of childhood anime like Dragonball Z or Pokemon, where the anime didn't necessarily have to have good plot devices to be fun to watch. This is different from other anime you may watch. This is completely straightforward in every aspect and doesn't drag.
Two, the action sequences are hype as hell. Long story short, All Might vs. Nomu = best anime fight of 2016. I'm a huge sucker for action sequences that are wonderfully animated and give viewers the ""epic"" feeling of a fight. All Might vs Nomu was a perfect example of that, and makes a powerful impact on my psyche. All of the other action sequences do the same, but just not as heavily as the final battle. Each action scene was is dazzling and highly entertaining to watch and pretty much just defies so many other Shonen anime that poorly attempt to give the audiences high-quality action.
Three, the music. This was the whole reason I started watching the anime in the first place, and it plays an insanely heavy role in the anime itself. Whenever ""You Say Run"" played in the anime, I turned my volume to the maximum. It's an absolutely fantastic song and brings the feeling of sheer power to every action scene. This motivated me to Pre-Order the soundtrack on CDJapan and I'm heavily satisfied with the music. There's a few generic and casual songs on it, but a healthy amount of epic and inspirational pieces that I should rank to give you an idea on the stuff you want to listen to.
1: You Say Run
2: 君はヒーローになれる (You Can Be a Hero)
3: 脅威との攻防 (Offense and Defense of the Threat)
4: Plus Ultra
5: ヴィランの侵攻 (Villain Invasion)
6: Hero A
7: 暴走する悪意 (Uncontrollably Evil)
8: jackontc's recreation of You Say Run
It's not a perfect anime, but it's damn fun to watch. If you feel like you're running low on good anime to watch this year, give this a chance. Boku no Hero Academia has so much potential, even enough potential to become a masterpiece, and I honestly hope for that to happen. If it doesn't, though, I still won't be disappointed because this anime is already impressive on its own. 
Worth watching? Hell yes. Go watch it.",8,Mcgillacuddy

                My calculation: 5.75 
(Overall rating computation doesn't include Enjoyment. It's an entirely personal metric that should not cloud ones judgment over any media.)
I marathoned this series right after finishing One Punch Man and... finally concluded that I still prefer Tiger and Bunny over the two mentioned.
Visuals were okay. Characters were stereotypes. I'm upset with Deku's impulsiveness albeit it was also the reason why Allmight took an interest on him. Still, there's a big difference between being a hero and being foolhardy -- being a hero does require one to forgo his own safety for the sake of other people, but doing that without as much
                  as a well-thought-out plan is just plain stupid and reckless.
This is Hero Academia, though, meaning you will not find heroics here but rather students training to be a hero. Yup, this is a shonen anime that has a school setting. Later parts would have these kids prove their mettle as they stand their ground against a threat. Then again, there's no heroism involve in here. It's just them fighting for their own survival.
All in all, it is a typical shonen with some character development supposedly but that premise got betrayed early on as the main character didn't remain ""quirkless,"" a world of supers and non-supers that didn't get explored well, and a roster of powers that range from cool to meh.
Did the first season made me thirst for more? A bit? Actually it was Stain (in season 2) that got me interested again with the series and... too bad he was just in for such a short time and my interest finally waned.",5,rzantua

                Well I decided to write a review for this one because it actually exceeded my expectations which is hard especially since I went in being very skeptical of the all to typical shounen. I even put it off till episode seven came out because of my skepticism.
Story-7
As everyone knows shounens are usually never to original in fact most follow a similar formula. However Boku no Hero Academia reminded me that its not a complex story that gives shounen its appeal but the feelings it inspires in you. Like some of you, I grew up with DragonballZ and Naruto, both of which arent master pieces but
                  the reason I loved them growing up and cherish them now is they motivated me, gave me feelings of aspiration and courage. Not trying to be sentimental but as you watch Hero Academia youll be reminded of the feelings you had the first time Goku turned into a supersayin, when Naruto defeats Pain, Ichigo faces off with Byakuya to save Rukia and so on. The story is very simple, with very simple explanations. Its set in a world were super powers are common place and heroes are a recognized occupation. Our protagonist is the familiar timid and humble character who longs to become one of those heroes yet has no power. The show is about his path to reaching his goal. And thats it no hidden messages, no cool metaphors or symbolism just a story about heroes and the making of them. Now dont get me wrong, personally my favorite genres include seinen and my all time favorite anime is the original Ghost in the Shell but like I said this is just a great example of light hearted fun with inspiring characters. 
Art-7
The art in Boku no Hero Academia isnt incredible but it isnt bad either. Like its story its simple and does the job perfectly. The fight scenes are done well enough and the colors are bright, flashy and over-the-top when it needs it to be. 
Sound/Music-10
This is were I believe the anime excels the most. Its a great example of what music can do for a show. It fits perfectly with the hero theme and those uplifting moments. Its no exaggeration when I say that half of what made the show great was the music. Best accompanying anime music that season in my opinion. The OP and ED where OK but the music during the show was much more impressive. Voice actors did a great job (japanese anyway), especially All-Mights. 
Characters-9
The characters in Boku no Hero Academia are kinda cut and pace from other series but somehow it does well with what its given and your able to still laugh along those same familiar moments, feel sad, motivated, excited etc despite seeing these same performances done by other characters before. In fact even though your aware of this from the beginning you may forget about it as the show progresses.
Enjoyment-10
Like Ive mentioned before the show does a really great job making you feel inspired and thats what a shounen is for. Its for ""boys"" (and girls) growing up who need that motivation to do their best in whatever they do. Even though I am in college now when I watched it, it gave me the same feelings I would have have if I were 14 and watching. 
Overall-9
Dont overlook it, I know its rare to find a shounen that can stand out among its many, many predecessors but Hero Academia is one of those and if you have ever enjoyed some of the classic shows that aired on Toonami when you were a kid then you may just enjoy this.",9,KR5-S14Kouki

                INTRODUCTION
Yes I am doing a MHA season 1 review in 2019/2020. The reason for this is that i want to just vent everything out i have in my head about MHA onto a website and know that i am free from the endless thought processes for MHA. So season 1, this establishes the main character in the anime and also as seen in most shounen anime it also establishes the main characters rival. the main character has a very cliche or generic goal to be the greatest hero and the rest of the show is as basic as that that characters end goal aim is.
THE
                  MAIN CHARACTER
The reality is that there is nothing wrong with have a generic/cliche plot such as ""i want to be the greatest"", the problem comes when nothing new is added onto that to make it seem different to what most people have already seen and 
that's where my biggest problem comes in for MHA is that it introduces nothing new. lets look at the main character first, he wants to be the best which is fine but outside of him being a little clumsy in battle he doesn't have any personality flaws, he has nothing for the audience to relate to as a character that is not perfect. The start of the anime showed Deku being an outcast because he didn't have a quirk so you'd think that going into a high school environment for him would be slightly socially challenging, nope! he immediately enters UA communicating and chatting with everyone and everyone pretty much is his friend straight off the rip. The problem is the realism of that people don't just go straight into a new school environment and start communicating effectively straight away unless they know the people already. So all the scenes they showed of Deku being bullied in school by Bakugo and how he was laughed at for not having a quirk gets thrown out the window. we then move into the other problem with Deku, started off with no quirk but then was given the most OP quirk in the entire show because of how gutsy he was and how much he reminded all might of what a true hero is. That's all well and good but why didn't the writers play with the fact that he has no powers, i mean seriously a person who could be really good at martial arts or swordsmanship would dominate this world, where there are  powers such as cement man, the guy who can decay things, the guy who can speak to animals, Froppy (i couldn't be arsed to google the names of these characters). Are u telling me a martial artist or even someone who is effective at free running wouldn't be effective in this world where some powers are just stupid. so what I'm saying is that they could of at least tried to play with that narrative. They did limit it for Deku by making it so that he cant control his powers yet but even then hes still in the top 2 strongest in the class. Overall for Deku i just think hes poorly written and as a character doesn't bring anything new to the table and i think the writers missed an opportunity. MOVING ON!!!
BAKUGO THE TERRIBLE
Bakugo in this anime is supposed to be the Deku's rival like Sasuke, Vegeta, Kuwabara, Killua and many others so its fair to say its a common thing in shounen which again is not a problem... Unless the new rival doesn't bring anything new to the table. I hate Bakugo with a passion and there is one main reason for this, in the entire first season he doesn't show a different side to himself and due to that all i see him as is an angry boy who hates on Deku because he got powers. Dont get me wrong i understand Bakugo's anger do i agree with his anger no but i do understand it. Lets look at other rivals in other shounen as an example, Vegeta is always looking to beat Goku in everything and for the most part feels like hes constantly behind him (does that remind you of anyone), however Vegeta constantly shows us a different side to his character for example, he marries Bulma and he cares for her even if he doesn't show it. Sasuke constantly looks down on Naruto apart from when he feels like Naruto is stronger than him but u still get to see a different side of his character when he jumped in front of those needles to save an incapacitated Naruto at the time. There are many other examples that i cant be arsed to mention for a rival showing the audience a different side to him. what i would of liked to see from Bakugo is a softer side even if i just saw it once in the entire first season, because 
then i wouldn't be thinking ""this dude is just always angry"". Bakugo wouldn't even have to show a softer side he could just show he cares when it comes to his training, for every training scene hes in he is fixated on Deku and not focused on doing well in the training. I just see Bakugo as a ball of hatred and not just towards Deku hes responds angry to everyone because he constantly feels like hes being undermined. Overall i just think hes poorly written for a main character rival... MOVING ON!!!!
THE PLOTS
I'm not going to get into detail about every single training thing that the class does because thats really long and not necessary for what I'm about to talk about. for the most part the other characters in the anime aren't bad and do a 
good enough job as support characters. I thought the training moments were done well for the most part although i do think they lacked some strategy. for the most part the training is a bit boring apart from the animation but it does what it needs to which is setup what the characters quirks are and what there limitations are for the quirks. The main plot is that the league of villains stole all might's teaching schedule and plan to attack All Might. the biggest problem i have with this arc is the fact that before all might arrived the villains weren't really doing anything to any of the students or the teachers. The teachers and students were doing just fine now that's a problem. Eraser head took out what seemed to be 50+ villains by himself but yet he said hes not that good at fighting large numbers of people by himself because that's his limitation. the other thing is that this is supposed to be the audiences first look at what the world of villains is like and what the real world is like, in reality the students are supposed to be totally outclassed by experience and feel totally overwhelmed and under-prepared but they don't. they fight the villains with not much problem now I'm not saying they could of beaten Nomu but the other villains they were dealing with just fine. The problem with that is the growth separation between the villains and the students, again as i said before the villains are supposed to be stronger mentally and more experianced than the students so if the audience sees that the students are being overpowered then us as the audience can realise that they need to do a lot of growing before they become pro heroes. Instead they do just fine and so you're immediately left feeling as if they are already prepared for the real world and that there's no growth for them to have. the Nomu and all might fight was OK, it just came down to all might punching him a bunch of times with no real strategy. It looked cool though as the animation was really good. Overall the story in the first season is a little bit boring and underwhelming but it doesn't do anything 
really badly. lastly this is the same thing i brought up before with Deku, if you have a really simple story or character the anime has to bring something new to the table. For this segment ill leave you with a question... was anything 
new brought to the table for the plots that you haven't seen in other anime?
THE WORLD
In the world of MHA you constantly hear the term ""number one hero"" thrown about but i felt like throughout the first season this was not really explained. Is All Might the number one hero because of his strength, popularity or is it 
because of the amount of work he does around the community. That is never really explained and so i personally never felt apart of the world because it wasn't explained enough, its just a subtle thing but its something i feel that requires an answer either through showing it or telling it for example, in Naruto you are told about the neighbouring villages and the ranks a ninja has. Even though it was told in Naruto at that moment and not shown its things like that that make you feel apart of the world. around 80% of people in this world are born with quirks/powers that do shit... again this is the other question i asked i pondered while watching this about Deku, Bakugo and the story, is this world bringing anything new to the table. the reality is that we've seen people have super powers before so in terms of world building what else does MHA have to offer and the answer is nothing. It has villains in this world that cause havoc for the citizens and heroes to fight them off, it has children who want to be those heroes and some even aspire to be ""number one"", some quirks are more effective in certain situations. That is all the world has to offer and nothing about it is new and even when you dig deeper and look at each student who wants to be a hero and you look at each villain its still remains to do nothing new. and lets be honest the world of MHA is basic, there's nothing complex about it. The world of MHA has a basic world with cliche characters, typical plots and typical goals but yet in every way it still doesn't bring anything new. So for that reason i cant give MY HERO ACADEMIA ANYTHING HIGHER THAN A 5/10!!!",5,TheKamo94

                Boku No Hero Academia Season 1: It's a season 1
The premise of My Hero Academia is really good as it takes on a pseudo-racial premise based around the show's idea of Quirks, and runs with it, using the main character to convey a very shonen theme of ""If you work hard enough and you show that you have the FIGHTING SPIRIT to be a hero, then sky's the limit, and you can be the best hero out there.""  Characters are likable, if not one-dimensional (excluding our main character), the soundtrack is standardly good, and the animation fluid with an art style that is distinctively
                  western, reminiscent of the Marvel and DC western comics.  
The only problem with this season 1 is that it's so short, and it kinda sorta feels like we got nowhere, unlike other season 1s (Kuroko no Basket comes to mind) where the season alone gives you a sense of how big the show's world is as well as a somewhat conclusive ending that will keep you satisfied until a season 2 comes out.  This show as a season 1 didn't do that for me, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm still excited to see what the rest of the show has to offer.  This is a series that is very much worth following! ^_^

                Super heroes sure have taken hold of the public interest over the last decade. Not super powers, those have been a staple of media for most of recorded history. Super heroes, the idea that one would purposefully use a supernatural trait for the betterment of others rather than personal conflicts and gain, have risen in prominence. As such, Boku no Hero Academia has had the good fortune of being a super hero anime during the genres hayday, and received wild praise and enjoyment all over the world.
The technical aspects of BHA certainly capitalize on traditional superhero themes. The soundtrack contains many over the top or
                  inspirational songs to accompany action scenes, and never stands out to any great degree for dramatic effect. The music and sound serve their purpose, notable only for setting the tone for a larger than life story.
Animation also takes a few pointers from other cartoon-styled super hero works. While the series is certainly done in modern anime style, the movements of the characters take pointers from franchises like One Punch Man and some American productions. Non-action movements involve many cuts and panning or zooming with the shot angle. There is also the use of animation that is fluid but undefined, with arms and legs flailing or not making contact with the surface around them. It's a style that accompanied the genre well, making it feel like a super hero production rather than an anime with super powers.
Focus for characters went for wide rather than deep with only 13 episodes for the first season. The main casts consists of about thirty characters, and while each one is given a personality and defining trait or two, few are delved into deeply. The main character, his mentor, and two or three of his classmates are the only ones to receive more attention, but what is shown has promise.
Each character has goals and struggles, and none are completely invincible, so their respective weaknesses lend depth and methods to explore the motives of the cast, as well as the reasons for their personalities. Some stick a little unbelievably to certain character traits, even when faced with reason to change, but each one fills a clear role and does so well. Overall, the first season does a good job setting up a basis to interact with the whole cast, but has to focus time on engaging with the main story and main character, leaving side characters for later seasons.
The plot of BNA delivers an excellent coming of age story that diverges nicely from many cliches and frustrations of other similar works. The ""hero"" is neither handed great strength nor overcomes all the odds despite an obvious weakness, but rather succeeds through training, effort, and growing into being strong. The cast has moments of both triumph and defeat, strength and weakness, hope and fear, but none are certain or persistent indefintiely. 
Since success wasn't guaranteed, moments of tension actually carried weight, rather having a lingering feeling that all would work out in favor of the protagonist. Sure there was a fair degree of ""and they/he arrived in the nick of time"" but all of the meantime was filled with action that made the future uncertain and powers that fought one another remained within their set parameters.
The biggest praise for the BNA storyline comes in how consistent the powers of the characters remain through the whole run time. There are no sudden power ups, new abilities pulled from no where, or power of friendship. Instead, powers are clearly defined and limited.
While some characters are seemingly more inherently powerful than others, greater importance is placed on how well one uses power rather than simple overwhelming force. A fun part of the series is seeing different powers interact or how seemingly niche powers can save the day.
Boku no Hero Academia is certainly worth a look for many different reasons. The hero's story is a nice change from ones of sudden power increases or planning so precise it borders on impossible, or both if you're Shiba Tatsuya. The main cast sets a nice stage for coming installments and has a certain charm in being both capable, yet often challenged. The overall setting is also a fresh face in the medium of anime that, while similar to things like the Index franchise, certainly has put in the effort and time to make a clear setting and world for itself apart from other possible influences.",8,Calcature

                While some might disagree with me, I feel this is one of those anime that isn't for everyone. If you don't like shounen, you probably won't like this. If you prefer stories that are more cynical and down to earth, you probably won't like this. If you're not a fan of old fashioned superhero stories, you probably won't like this.
Both the shounen genre and the superhero genre have done a lot of growing in the past few years. Similar to more recent magical girl shows, these genres have been trying to break out of their previous molds. The stories and characters are becoming more grounded.
                  More time is taken to explain how and why certain things happen. The characters are put through harsher situations to make the tension more realistic. In short, gritty and dark has been a trend as of late.
Boku no Hero Academia is nothing like that. For the most part, it's lighthearted. The line between good and evil is drawn very clearly. There are certainly stakes, but even when things are at their toughest, you can count on everyone making it out alive and mostly unscathed.
The plot is pretty basic. One day, people started being born with ""quirks,"" the term for superpowers in this anime. There's no real reason given for it, it just happened. Following that, villains started appearing around the world, and professional heroes rose up to fight against them.
Our main character, Izuku, was born without any sort of quirk, which has become rare in this world. Despite that, he still dreams of becoming a great hero and being able to save others like his idol, All Might. Through a series of coincidences, he ends up meeting All Might, and he manages to leave an impression on him that leads him to decide to take Izuku on as a pupil.
And that's about as far as I think I can go without spoiling anything, though it's really easy to figure out where the plot is going from there if you know anything about your shounen or superhero tropes.
The reason I'm still giving this series such a high score is a matter of how well it does all these traditional ideas. This is a very basic superhero story, but the fact of the matter is, superheroes haven't actually gotten that much exposure in anime. Not as much as in the West, at least. There are some superhero anime, but most shounen focus on something more connected to a type of mystical lore.
Naruto is about ninjas. Dragonball has aliens and powerful attacks fueled by qui. Bleach is about soul reapers. Soul Eater is about the same thing, but looks at it from a different angle. Bnha is about an academy for training superheroes, plain and simple.
This simplicity allows the writers to get away with certain things that other shounen can't. I've never seen a shounen that was this popular that only had 13 episodes for its first season. Bnha cuts a lot of the fat, because they assume you'll just accept that this is a world with superheroes and that schools for training superheroes just are a thing now. They assume you won't question how a lot of the quirks work or why they appeared in the first place.
If you're not a person who can handle that, then this isn't for you. This is a show made for people who are looking for this kind of thing and just want to have fun with it. Is it deep? No. Is it thought provoking? No. Is it any sort of masterpiece? No, but it's a heck of a lot of fun for those who like these tropes and want to see them at their best. If you just want to see cool people do cool things while screaming about friendship and justice and the like, you can't do much better than this. It's nothing that will leave your mind blown the way some smarter anime will, but it'll leave you with a good feeling. If you're having a rough day and you're not up for something deep or dark, I say pull up a chair and enjoy. Bnha might be just what you need.",9,Greenwaves31

                my hero is a lame ass anime in fact what I should say is that my hero fans are terrible. In season 4 the fans complained about the sky the fucking sky being animated truly pathetic,  they love making gay ships to straight characters however if the awful fandom doesn't effect you then you will love the show.
the show is ram packed with action around every corner and the heroic adventure of deku 
the characters feel very bland they feel like they have no emotion compared to the other characters. deku , bakago and all might to seem like the only character who was
                  made like they have emotion and for the other its not in the sense of the voice actor not putting his/her/their heart and sole it to the job its just the characters being boring

I know that many have already talked about the good and bad points of this anime, however, I want to tell you what's my opinion about it and the amount of mistakes that this anime did in this particular seasson. So, it's time to have fun with the ideas that this show presented to us:
1. Introduction: ""This is the history of how I convert into the strongest hero"". Since the introduction, the show have already killed the tension becuase from now on we know that the protagonist, in one way or another, will not be killed and/or will be revived like
                  in other fighting shonen. Was that introduction really neccesary? Mystery.
2. Deku's flashback: Why in the flashback the writer only show the bad things that happened to Deku? No fucking idea. This is basically, victimization. Deku didn't face his problems and just tried to forget about it. I know this doesn't justify the harassment he received, however, was it difficult to ask, at least, someone for help? I do not know. Additionally, if he wanted to be a hero, isn't supposed that he should have some type of training? What he did in all this time in order to achieve his goal? Mystery. The worst part is that, with the advance of the episodes, we discovered that this flashback didn't have any relevance to the plot. So the show could have easily skipped this flashback and focus in the main story if you ask me.
3. All Might giving the powers: He recognized Deku as a potential superhero for trying to help someone without having any special ability. In this point, the story sounded interesting. It's the underdog premise that, with a proper execution, have given great results like the case of Ashita no Joe, however, later, All Might decided to give Deku his powers negating a great message that the anime could have given to us. What was the purpose of try to make Deku look like an underdog if he gonna receive special powers anyway? I don't know. In addition, All Might have recently met him, he didn't know anything about him and, however, he gave him powers, there are no other people with similar 'good heart' in the world of the series? What makes Deku really special then? This is a big plot convenience if you ask me.
4. Training: Why Deku only trained for 10 months in order to control his powers? Mystery. Other characters have trained for years in order to control their powers and this little kid achieve it in months. This a fucking nonsense is you ask me. To make things worse, later, we will see a lot of covenient abilities that Deku gonna show, like the case that I'm gonna mention in the next point. Also, wouldn't it have been better to apply for the UA entrance exam 1 year later? I don't know.
5. UA entrance exam: It is a great coincidence that Uraraka has been trapped in the rubble so that Deku can show his powers for the first time. It wouldn't have easier that she used her levitation abilities to escape from it? No fucking idea. Deku was injured after this scene and, later, we discovered that he have regenerative abilities. Wouldn't it have been better to show how he recovers in a more organic way by making him learn from his mistakes? I do not know. If the introduction was already killed most of the tension, this part made things even worse.
6. Bakugou: Is there an humanly possible form to explain his irrational hate against Deku? Mystery. Is like a forced way to make a rival for Deku. How is it possible that the teachers find Bakugou's behavior with Deku normal? I don't know. Even in real life, teachers don't go to that level of irresponsibility and recklessness if you ask me.
7. The plan against All Might: How it's possible that the villains didn't know, anticipatedly, the abilities of the students? Mystery. Also, how they pretended to catch All Might sending only 1 Nomu? It wouldn't have been better send more in order to have more chances to succeed? I don't know. This part was extremely convenient in order to maintain all the characters of the main cast.
The good aspects are the soundtrack and the animation that are cool. I'm gonna give points for that. 
This first season, in conclusion, is the future sight of the mess up that the show will be from now on. The underdog premise was really wasted and could have been the best way to make the anime if you ask me.",3,RomanceEnjoyer48

I'm not just an anime fan, I also love superheroes. The Capes, the Colorful (and sometimes not so colorful) costumes, the sometimes nonsensical even when they're trying to be serious plotlines, the dumb no kill rules, I love it all. And as a DC fan who was massively disappointed by Batman V Superman all I can say is that this series helped get the taste of that failure out of my mouth. Let's dive into the story before this becomes a Batman V Superman rant.
Story: Welcome to a world where 80% of the population have special abilities called quirks. These can be
                  anything from fire manipulation to being able to grow as large as a building. But not everyone wants to use their powers for good. So what do you do? You make Superhero-ing (I know that's not a word) a legitimate business. Enter Midoriya, a quirkless kid who wants to become a hero in order to follow in the footsteps of his idol All Might. All Might is the greatest hero ever and is a self appointed ""Symbol of Peace"". However Midoriya's dreams get shot down at every turn, his classmates laugh at him and even his mother doesn't really give him any encouragement. That is until one day Midoriya runs into All Might. Even All Might tells Midoriya to give up on being a hero at first, until he witnesses Midoriya running head first into a battle showcasing that he has a heart of a hero. All Might then decides to train Midoriya so he can get accepted into the most prestigious Hero school.
Joining Midoriya on his quest to become the greatest hero ever are: 
All Might: The symbol of peace is a great guy. He's basically Superman, even his theme sounds suspiciously similar to the Donner Superman theme. He's a great guy who's always smiling to inspire hope in others, even when he himself is in a terrible situation.
Ochaco Uraraka: A nice girl and one of Midoriya's class mates, she has the ability to make things float.
Tenya lida: Another one of Midoriya's classmates, he's all about rules and such. He's the flash, he can run fast.
Katsuki Bakugo: This guy's an asshole. He was Midoriya's friend (Sort of...he was still an asshole when he was a kid) in the past but their friendship slowly deteriorated as time went on. Now Bakugo just bullies Midioriya for fun. He has the ability to form explosions in his palms.
The Animation is fantastic...not much more to say. It's Bones, it'd be weird if I said anything else.
The soundtrack is also fantastic. The three standouts being ""The Day"" by Porno Graffiti (Don't laugh!), ""You say run"", and ""Hero A"". 
The show isn't the most original but it does a fine job with what it has, though I will admit that the first three episodes are slow. After that though the show is a ride on the hype train all the way through, especially the last three episodes. The characters (outside of Midoriya and All Might) aren't the most fleshed out by this point either but you have to remember that we're going straight Shonen up in this bitch, so we still have like 100 more episodes to flesh these guys out.
Overall it's a great series that doesn't exactly do anything new but makes what it has work.",8,fatboyftw

                Boku No Hero Academia is a very charming and lovable story about a boy, who dreams of being a superhero, despite being born without powers becoming the next symbol of peace. Its a charming hilarious story with attachable characters.
Story: The story takes place in a school and we follow the students as they face different dilemmas in their world or just fun shenanigans at school. However, I feel the story arcs move quickly from one thing to the next. I wish it took more time and care to really flesh out what was happening at times more.
Art: The animation is probably where this show falls
                  short of. There isn't much art direction and its nearly always just daytime bright colours. Some frames look ugly and rushed. Honestly, it feels more like coloured in manga pages rather than its own stand-alone piece of art. Though with the episode count likely being over 100 in the end, comparing to other shows such as Hunter x Hunter and Haikyuu, it shows you are able to be consistent with the artwork and still have a large episode count.
Characters: The students are where you will get the most enjoyment out of this show. Watching them interact and grow as individuals and grow relationships with each other is where most of the enjoyment comes from. However, at times, some side characters feel a little one dimensional and a little forgettable, with only being in the show for comedic purposes, such as Mineta. The characters also fall short with the villains. I wish the villains would be more fleshed out with their ideologies and reasons for their beliefs. It feels rushed at times and I wish they took more care of them.
Enjoyment: This show is really enjoyable. Its lots of fun and exciting to see the students grow and develop as people and as heroes. However, some of the other aspects such as inconsistent story, poor art and unfleshed out characters sometimes take away from that.
Although this show is enjoyable, I will be dropping it for the manga, as I feel the anime doesn't add much, other than the story being animated.",5,Moyosore

                I quickly dropped it, i first gave it 3/10 bit i realized that wasn't fair. 
the main characters just sucks, characterd in general are low iq sheeps without any real goals. The villains in the show are just monsters with less intelligance than dogs. 
The story isn't interesting at all either. The loser teenager got selected by allmight for no good reason, he was rewarded for acting like an idiot saving a guy that bullied him earlier, obviously he should have died but ofc he was saved by plotarmor. 
The fights and animations where ok but it was impossible to get involved in any way.
                  
It was a total waste of time watching it.",2,adolf512

                ""There's a hero in all of us""
I don't watch a lot of shounen shows because I just don't like them in general but My Hero Academia is quite different from other shounen shows out there and it's one of the main reasons why I enjoyed the series so much.
[Story]: (8/10)
My Hero Academia wasn't my most hyped anime because I thought it was going to be a typical shounen anime that we already have seen..*Ahem* The big 3 and countless more shounens out there. *ahem* but this series really surprised me. My friends who knows me knows that I'm the kind of person who likes to
                  cheer for the underdogs because cheering for people who are very talented and can beat opponents easily is very boring. There's just this different kind of excitement that you get when cheering for the underdogs and that's what I got from watching My Hero Academia. 
The plot of the series is basically about a young guy named Izuki Midoriya. 80% of humanity has this power called ""quirk"". In other words, abilities and superpowers. Midoriya is one of the 20% who doesn't have a quirk but he still dreams to become a hero and never gives up. One day, he met his idol, All Might (the greatest superhero in the world). All Might saw something interesting about Midoriya. He knew he has the potential to become a hero so he passed down his ability to Midoriya and decides to train him. Midoriya then decides to join U.A, the most prestigious school in the city, and he learns what it truly means to become a hero. 
Izuku's determination.....His drive to become a hero is what got me cheering for Midoriya. In the earlier part of the series, we see Midoriya doing everything he can to try and become a hero despite the fact that it's impossible to become one unless he has a quirk. I don't know about you guys but I got this strange feeling, like someone's gripping my heart whenever I see Midoriya backed into the corner. It's just very painful to see someone fail even though they worked so hard to try and achieve their goal. Yes, I admit, there were tears in my eyes and I cried a little bit because I felt for him. No surprise; he managed to overcome his own weakness, with the help of All Might, and this is what led him to become a hero.
I don't think there's anything more to talk about the show in terms of story because it is still a pretty typical shounen story. A villian whose plan is to do villainous things disrupts the people's way of life and the good guys comes and saves the day. 
What sets this series apart from other shounen shows out though is the fact that Midoriya is not an overpowered MC. He inherited a powerful quirk from All Might but we see him, throughout the series, still struggling to use his currently obtained quirk. He isn't some one man army that can easily defeat a villian by going super saiyan mode. Speaking of one man army, that term doesn't even exist in this series. I was actually surprised to see all of them devising a plan and working together. This series encourages teamwork.. When was the last time you've seen that in a shounen series?
I honestly wish My Hero Academia could have been a 2-cour series because based on the pacing of this season, it felt like a whole giant setup to what was about to happen in the next season. I mean, I'm not complaining or anything. In fact, I'm glad the pacing was slow because they took all the time they need to focus not only on Midoriya's character but also the other main and side characters. Although, I'm glad that the 2nd Season was confirmed right after the show ended and now....The Waiting Game begins!
______________________________________________________________
[Art/Animation]: (9/10)
I've been reading Marvel comics for as long as I can remember and when I first saw the show's art-style, it honestly felt like I was watching a Marvel comic being animated. It didn't even feel like I was watching an anime at first. I just love MHA's unique artstyle. I do have a bit of complaint when it comes to the animation. Mainly, the fighting scenes. Half of the time, the fighting scenes are very unappealing to watch because it's inconsistent as hell. For example, 15 seconds of somewhat smooth fighting scene then it switches to an ""animated slide show (with those white moving lines on the sides)"" effect. I just didn't like it. The character designs are also pretty good but with few female characters being subjected to fanservice. There's not a lot though so thank God for that.  
______________________________________________________________
[Sound]: (10/10)
No brainer, My Hero Academia easily won the best Soundtrack of Spring 2016. The battle OST's are so goddamn good and the insert songs....My god, the insert songs is what made the action scenes so worth watching. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)
The OP theme song is ""The Day"" by Porno Graffiti. The name of the band is Porno Graffiti hmm?? Yea..I'm not even going to make a joke about that name because I don't have the energy as of the time I'm writing this. Anyways, the song is ok. Nothing too special and I'll doubt I'll remember it in the future. The ED theme song is ""HEROES"" by Brian the Sun. Haha, that moment when the ED theme song is a whole lot better than the OP theme song. I love the singer's voice, the buildup before the chorus and the chorus itself. 
______________________________________________________________
[Characters]: (9/10)
We don't really get a lot of characters like Midoriya. Maybe, we do but not as a protagonist so this series was kind of a breath of fresh air in terms of a protagonist being powerless. Izuku Midoriya is one of the few main characters that got the most screentime and character development so I'm only going to focus on him and not so much on the side characters. The side characters were pretty entertaining though but I don't want to get into that right now. 
I didn't see Izuku Midoriya as some cliched shounen-type protagonist who can defeat any enemies he wants and if he can't defeat said enemies, it will later turn out that he has some hidden special power that he never knew had. I just saw Midoriya as some regular powerless kid who has a dream/goal but he couldn't achieve it at first due to his circumstances. Of course, he gets a quirk later on in the series but like I said earlier in the review, he doesn't turn into an overpowered ""one man-army"" character. The series emphasizes teamwork and that's one of the few aspects that I love about this series. This becomes pretty notable at the final arc of this season when the students are forcibly separated into small groups and are forced to work together to defeat the villains. How were they separated? If I answer that question then I'm going to cross the spoiler zone so I won't answer the question.  
The character development for Midoriya was amazing. As you watch the series, you'll notice the changes in Midoriya's character as he tries to become a hero but first, he has to go through certain obstacles to achieve his dream. One of the key factors to his character development is Bakugou and All Might. 
At first, All Might is like how everyone see's him. He's a symbol of peace and his a perfect hero. While the former may be true, the latter is what will surprise the viewers. He may seem perfect but every time he gets out there and do his usual hero stuff, I can't help but feel nervous for him and this is actually the first time I feel nervous for a character who's very powerful but has a weakness that's obviously holding him back. 
I'm surprised that all of My Hero Academia's supporting characters are very entertaining to watch. Even though they're not as fleshed out as the main characters, each one of them has a unique personality and it didn't feel like they were just there just to fill up the tables in Midoriya's class. Each one of them is likable and we get to know them when the show decides to give them a slight introduction of their character and their quirk. It's really interesting how the show wants you to see the supporting characters as part of the team and someone you should care for rather than throwing them in the trashcan and not giving them a slightest bit of screentime just because they're a ""supporting character"". For example, Tsuyu is a supporting character and she's really beginning to be my best girl of the series due to how they portrayed her in the final arc. For now though, Uraraka is still my best girl of the series. 
______________________________________________________________
[Enjoyment]: (9/10)
Like I said earlier in my review, MHA wasn't my most hyped series because it's a shounen series and I got tired of that genre long time ago. MHA was something different and it's a shounen series that I really enjoyed so much. I might get back to watching shounen again 
______________________________________________________________
[VERDICT]
My Hero Academia is a shounen series but it sets itself apart from other shounen shows out there. Instead of your usual overpowered MC defeating villians, this is more of an exciting and emotional series that focuses on the MC's character growth on his path to become a hero. If you're a fan of the shounen genre and you want something new then MHA is definitely recommended. If you're not a fan of the genre then you might still want to check out MHA because it is a different take on the usual shounen shows that we get these days. 
[OVERALL]: (9/10)
Pros:
+Different take on an overdone shounen genre
+Focuses more on Midoriya's character growth rather than him being an Overpowered MC. 
+Unique art-style
+Intense OST and insert songs
+Great cast of characters
Cons:
-Action scenes sometimes felt like an ""animated slide show""",9,jc9622

                If you haven’t heard of Boku no Hero Academia already, either you live under a rock or everyone else lives on a different planet. It’s hard not to hear fans of the manga hyping up this series before it even started. And even before release, it was considered to be the next big thing for the western population. Now whether or not the anime succeeding in doing so is up to you. There was a lot of things in Boku no Hero Academia’s favor. It’s based off of a high-selling Shounen Jump manga, it had studio Bones working on the adaptation, and the manga is
                  considered to be one of the best battle shounen manga out there. In short, there were little chances of mess ups. And luckily, Bones didn’t mess up at all.
~{Story}~
Okay, I’m not going to tell you that Boku no Hero Academia has a creative and inventive premise, because it doesn’t at all. Actually, this is the most cliché a battle shounen anime could ever be. The setting takes place in an alternate world where people manifest supernatural powers know as quirks. Only 20% of the population ends up without a quirk. Our protagonist, Midoriya Izuku, falls in that 20%. Midoriya, a superhero fanboy, who always wants to be a hero is the one without the chance of being one. One day after certain situations happened, the greatest superhero gave him the opportunity to manifest his quirk and become a hero. The whole series revolves around Midoriya and his journey in a superhero high school. Sounds original? Of course not! But where Boku no Hero Academia shines isn’t in its premise, but rather its execution. It’s hard to describe what it is that makes this series enjoyable to watch. The characters are just so well done, despite its tropes, and they’re easily relatable. The series goes through some really interesting situations the revolves around its characters. And the series ends on a high note due to an action-based arc. The only problem is that the series doesn’t cover much, therefore it doesn’t get the opportunity to showcase its biggest talent – when the series tackles darker themes. But there’s always a second season!
Story: 7/10
~{Presentation}~
Despite its cliché premise, what makes Boku no Hero Academia so good is its execution. The series is filled with heart. It only takes two episodes to show that the series has an emotional touch to it. And the series manages to tackle some pretty important themes, such as bullying, what media portrays, and what decides the good and evil. Boku no Hero Academia is an excellent underdog story. But the series isn’t just about Midoriya, but it’s also about his friends, his rivals, his mentors, and his opponents. Boku no Hero Academia is a story about everyone, and how everyone makes one, which is a nice contrast to Midoriya’s quirk “One for All”. The series is primarily arc based, and this format works well for this series, and every other shounen anime. The biggest problem with Boku no Hero Academia is its pacing. It’s quite slow for a shounen anime with a 13-episode first season. In its 13 episodes, the series only manages to adapt a little over 20 chapters. So the average pacing is less than two chapter per episode. It may be a slow adaptation, but it’s a loyal one too. Nothing from the manga is skipped, and the tiny, anime-original moments are top notch (for example, a fight was extended to be twice as long in the second last episode). True dedication was put into this series.
Presentation: 8/10
~{Character}~
The best thing about Boku no Hero Academia is it characters – they’re marvelous. What seemed like clichés on paper, turned out to be three-dimensional in reality. Every character is special in every way, no matter how minor they are. As you can see from the key visuals that the cast in Boku no Hero Academia is humongous. Our protagonist, Midoriya Izuku, is one of the best shounen protagonist you’ll ever see. Yes, he may be too much of a geeky fanboy at times. Yes, he might be a crybaby at times. Yes, he doesn’t deserve his powers. Yes, he’s not flashy like every other shounen main character. But what makes him so good is that he’s filled with heart. Nicknamed as Deku, Midoriya’s Deku means to never give up (according to him), and that suits him. Even after having no hope, he still never gave up. And his reward came to him. And he’s not the only star of the show. His mentor, All Might, is a fascinating character. What seems like perfection in front of the world, turns out to be imperfect in reality. All Might’s a great representation of what eyes can deceive. His imperfectness is what makes him human, and what makes him a good character too. Bakugou Katsuki, who started off as the cliché bully for Midoriya, ended up being, well, still the same. But Bakugou never feels irritating, despite his attitude. He’s both badass and (unintentionally) funny enough to be a great character. Next we have Midoriya’s love interest, Uraraka Ochako, who ends up being a loveable character despite her cliché characteristics. And she’s really funny too. And then we have Iida Tenya, who gives you more Genos vibes than anything (and what a coincidence that his seiyuu is the same as Genos’s). And he too is really likeable and understandable. We do meet the antagonists of this series, but not much has been done to develop them, though that’ll be saved for the later seasons.
Character: 8/10
~{Art}~, 
As you can see from the key visuals, Boku no Hero Academia has quite a unique, yet pretty, art style. Colors are more deeper and outlines are more thicker, and all of this looks great. Considering the fact that it’s Bones behind this anime, it’s not a faraway guess if you predict that the series will have good art. Thr backgrounds look amazing and it’s really pretty to look at. The art style is much more cartoonish compared to most anime, yet the series manages to look prettier. And the amount of detailing given to architectures and backgrounds are amazing. The art style resembles an American cartoon or comic, which matches its whole superhero concept. And the character designs are also fantastic. The characters look younger than other anime characters of the same age, because Boku no Hero Academia takes a more realistic approach in character proportion. And some of the superhero costume designs are absolutely phenomenal. Just look at Bakugou and Iida’s costume – they look incredible. 
Art: 9/10
~{Animation}~
Bones not only delivers in the art aspect of Boku no Hero Academia, but also the animation aspect too. For most of the series, the animation quality is consistent and fluid and there’s never any noticeable hiccup. The character animations are fluid, the background animations are lively and the lighting animations look great too. There are moments in the series where the animation quality takes a sudden jump. These moments are absolutely beautiful to watch and can challenge One Punch Man quality (and that says a lot). The two most beautifully animated moments from Spring 2016 comes from Boku no Hero Academia (a small-scale fight in episode 7 and a large-scale fight in episode 12). The fight in episode 12 in particular was amazing. The cinematography, the fluidity, all felt amazing. Rarely do I ever watch a fight 10 times back-to-back.
Animation: 8.5/10
~{Voice Acting}~
The voice acting in Boku no Hero Academia is also very good, with some very good standout voices. Yamashita Daiki does a very good job as Midoriya. He does the zealous part and the emotionally moved part of him amazingly, while at the same time he manages to do the strategic and calm part of his character too. Miyake Kenta does a perfect job as All Might, as he captures his strength and weakness perfectly. It’s surprising how he was able to make one voice match both All Might personas. Okamoto Nobuhiko is probably the best choice for Bakugou. He does his aggressive and egotistical character with ease. There’s absolutely no complaints about his casting. Ishikawa Kaito coincidently got to play as another character that follows the rules and is righteous. He does Iida excellently. Sakura Ayane does an okay job as Uraraka. It doesn’t stand out as much as the other seiyuu work in this series, but it works. And Kaji Yuki is surprisingly a good fit for Todoroki. I expect great things from him in the next season. And the rest of the supporting seiyuu do a good job too. Boku no Hero Academia already has a dub going on, so you can check that out too if you want. From the couple episodes I’ve heard from the English dub, it’s pretty average, nothing too special. Some miscasting is present though.
Voice Acting: 7.5/10
~{Music}~
There’s only one word that can describe the music in Boku no Hero Academia: godly. Considering the fact that we have Haikyuu’s music composer, one can expect some good music in the series. There’s just so many memorable background music from this series. The rap music that is played throughout some moments in the series, such as Midoriya’s training montage, is absolutely addicting and cool to listen too. It really gets you pumped up. The main background theme used (the one used in the previews) is also really good too. But my personal favorite background music has to be the theme for the villains. When they appear, and when that track starts, you know sh*t’s about to hit the fan really hard. The OP and ED in the series is extremely good too. The OP, “The Day”, is absolutely fantastic and enthralling. The music is great and the vocals are exciting. The verse before the chorus always gets me, and the chorus exists to hype up the upcoming episode. The ED, “HEROES”, is a very good song that has both good music and vocals that complement each other. And it adds to the emotional aspect of Boku no Hero Academia.
Music: 9/10
~{Enjoyment}~
If it wasn’t obvious by now, yes, I loved Boku no Hero Academia a lot. Maybe I like it more than I should, may you like it less then you are, but Boku no Hero Academia is something fresh in the shounen genre, despite not looking like so in the initial looks. The series is filled with heart and emotional impact and the serie manages to tackle some really important themes. And the characters are so enjoyable. Not a single one of them end up being underdeveloped. And the art and animations are fantastic. Though I would have enjoyed this series a little more if the pacing was a lot faster, since it’s quite slow in comparison to its fast-paced manga. But other than that, this is one hell of a ride. 
Enjoyment: 8/10
Boku no Hero Academia is an absolute must watch for those who are fans of the genre. If you like superhero or battle shounen anime and you haven’t tried out this anime yet, you’re wasting your time. And for those who aren’t fans of the genres, you should still try it out. It’s not the most original anime out there, but the execution makes up for it. It’s got a great cast of characters and the main plot and world building is great. And Bones delivers with their amazing art and animation. Add in some kickass background music and some solid voice acting, you’ve got yourself a solid anime. It takes time for it to get to the good part, and this season didn’t even adapt the best parts of the manga yet, but still this series manages to exceed expectations and be better than almost all the anime from this season. Boku no Hero Academia is an anime that lives up to its expectations and can prove to be a big franchise in the future.
+ Proves that solid execution can make a generic script into a unique one
+ Fantastic characters, which each of them being special in their own way
+ Fantastic action sequences, boasted by great art and animations
+ Great underdog story with a spectacular final arc, which warms up the second season 
+ Outstanding background music complements the content
- Pacing can be too slow at times

                	If I were to explain what makes this show great to someone who's never seen anime, I think I would use the following analogy: Think of the simple task of cooking an egg; something that anyone can do. You would have the same expectation for the egg every time. But, if you bring in a buffoon to cook it, he’ll screw it up. Yet, if you bring a professional to cook it, they’ll take every step and do it in such a way as to maximize the quality of the same very simple dish. That is what Boku no Hero is. A very simple dish
                  that is cooked in such a satisfying way. Nothing new, just the same old taste by someone who knows how to cook.
	The first three episodes follow the development of our main protagonist from some guy who has no superpowers and is a total wimp to someone who learns to grow and give it his all and at least tries to be more confident. You know, the story is nothing great. Pretty simple. A guy is weak and stands out in a bad way compared to everyone else and he gains great power through his passion and grows as a person. But, my god, the execution, and writing just carry’s this meh story into a Woaah story. Midoriya, the main protagonist, has this obsession with wanting to be a hero, and when he is denied that, he shatters into a million pieces. In this world, getting a special personalized power means a lot to people; these powers called quirks. Something you can empathizing with as mortifying to Midoriya. Yet, he doesn’t give up even though the world has told him it's basically impossible. In fact, he doubles down. He keeps these notebooks where he extensively and obsessively logs the quirks that he witnesses that others have. All this to try his absolute hardest to bridge the seemingly unbridgeable gap with knowledge. And this contrast between his diligence and passion with his cowardice and lacking ability serves to create an interesting character with flaws that I want to root for. 
	A character introduced earlier on was All Might. He is the all-American, from the ground up, pure physical strength, trademark superman of the world: the symbol of all that is good. Midoriya in this passionate way holds him up like a deity and a role model like how back in the day I would deify Goku from Dragon Ball and the pharaoh from yu-gi-oh as these badasses that I wanted to be. It’s really great, he’s even holding the action figure and has this pure look of childish joy on his face. This truly sells to me the amount of admiration Midoriya has for All-Might. This makes the meeting that Midoriya has with All Might even more interesting. When Midoriya meets All-Might for the first time, he’s in the middle of saving the day like he always does. Midoriya expectedly follows his role-model obsessively because he wants to meet him. Long story short, they end up on top of a secluded building and one of the most unexpected things happens. All-Might loses his super buff, superhuman form and turns into this dinky, skinny, suspicious looking character. The expression that Midoriya has on his face perfectly sums up the situation and mirrors the look on the audiences faces, “Huh?”. It turns out that All-Might is a flawed human being that isn’t the best at dealing with people and doesn’t have perfect judgement of reasoning skills. I think this is perfect. It points out an underlying theme in the show that is constantly explored in depth: there are no true saints no matter how brightly they shine. Even all might, the strongest superhero in the world with unparalleled fame and high status as the symbol of peace is still at the end of the day this deeply flawed man underneath, and no amount of muscle and suits can cover that up. In a world full of superheroes and supervillains, there flaws, and raw human emotion lend them a sense of legitimacy. Midoriya asks All-Might if even though he doesn’t have a quirk if he could become a hero and All-Might flat out tells him no, that he needs to be realistic and realize that the world can’t work that way. A pretty painful thing to hear, but Midoriya still hasn’t given on up the inside. He may be on the verge of giving up consciously, but not subconsciously. We come to find a little bit later than the Baddie that All-Might was chasing escaped and is wreaking havoc. Unfortunately, All-Might can’t help because he’s all out of power. So, in an unlikely turn of events, Midoriya ends up at that place too. He sees the exact same situation as all might does, as well as all the other heroes around him, yet he does something that none of them do, he just blindly jumps in and rushes at the baddie who’s holding someone hostage and tries to save the guy, even if he is so powerless. This in turn inspires All-Might, who has realized why he’s a hero, to gather what little strength he has left and save the day. Not only is this scene great in that Midoriya, this quirkless guy, inspires his role-model, All-Might the superman of the world, it is also great in that Midoriya embodies what it means to be a true hero. There are hero schools, hero organizations, and regulations on heroes that were laid down by the government: an elaborate system for being a hero. Yet, all this is superfluous. Getting caught up in all of it misses the point of being a hero. You shouldn’t have to always watch your every step, follow the protocol to a tee, and do what your told. You’re a hero! And there is one thing a hero does, save the day no matter what. This may be idealistic, but it’s also an ideal which makes you smile and feel that rush of excitement and warmth. Midoriya just jumps in because there is someone who needs his help and he needs to save them, the hallmark of what a hero is. He reignited that same feeling in All-Might and showed him where his roots lie. Sure, its illogical that Midoriya jumped in so foolishly, but that misses the point entirely. This is a scene that shows two types of heroes, the classic whole-hearted hero and the modern, regulated one, before posing the question: what makes a true hero?
	Midoriya inspiring All-Might leads to him feeling that he has found someone worthy of inheriting his quirk (A unique quirk that is inherited through generations and has to do with legacy power). All-Might offers his quirk to Midoriya and Midoriya just breaks down in tears because after so long, after feeling that he’d never realize it, his dream had come true. All that pain and sorrow from people telling him he couldn’t, being bullied for not having a quirk and having to slog through the swamp of despair and move forward with trying to be a hero. It all comes to a head and comes bursting forth from Midoriya. The weight has been lifted off his back. He begins his training under All-Might in order to inherit the quirk and we are treated to this satisfying montage of Midoriya, cleaning the beach that is basically a dump. He trains by carrying all of these heavy objects across the beach in certain ways to train his muscles as well as eating a heavy diet and getting enough rest. Still, Midoriya diligence shines through and he goes overboard with it. At the end of his training, which lasted about a year, we see him standing on a collected pile of trash, ripped, clenching his fists with his head pointed toward the sky, screaming a victory cry at the top of his lungs. It’s only been three episodes, but seeing him at the end of this long journey of finally becoming able to fulfill his dream transfers all that emotion from Midoriya to the audience. 
	The reason I went into such extensive detail about the first three episodes is that I believe they serve as both a solid foundation for the show and give a feeling for both the potential and place where the show is heading. A mini-arc that I absolutely adore and beautifully sets up the show by pulling me in deep. Something that characterized the first three episodes along with the entire series is character. All the cast like Midoriya and All-Might, are simple characters with simple motivations. Yet, by design, the more exposure you have to them, the more endearing they become. You learn about their strengths and weaknesses. You see them in the moment, and not just in the past. Every second tells you a little something new about their growth or who they are. That’s just a little piece of what some great writing can do. Take Bakugo. Doesn’t start out very nice. In fact, he’s the biggest asshole in the world by the mere fact that he is the biggest, most avid bully towards Midoriya and constantly hammers home how much more inferior he is just to boost his own ego. But then he is humiliated and has to be saved by Midoriya. We learn that being praised so much and everyone following him and saying how great he was got to his head to the point where he could only see Midoriya as a quirkless freak. He wholeheartedly believes he is superior because of the people around him and that starts to wear down when he is saved by that same quirkless freak. It finally cracks when he is bested by Midoriya, a humiliation which gets to the core of his being and makes us see him as more than just an aggressive asshole; he really values his pride and wants to make sure he lives up to giftedness others saw in him for himself. The characters may be simple, but these little moments and nuggets of information just add on and give these characters life. Not to mention design. Bakugo has these sharp features and spiky hair to emphasized how sharp-edged he is.  The hero costumes are great. They have this extra level of detail put into them to make the world more vivid, like how Bakugo’s forearm sleeves look like grenades.
	Another thing I want to point out is the character dynamics between Midoriya and the cast. When Midoriya deeply engages with another character in the cast, like Bakugo or All-Might, he instills at least a little of that classic hero passion into them. In turn, he learns about those around him and how people have their own problems even as superheroes. These pieces of information allow him to grow. But this only works because Midoriya is who he is: a passionate, diligent man who constantly is working to learn from his mistakes and be a better person. When he comes with his idealistic hero philosophy and has to confront other people’s philosophies, others who might be more cynical or unmoving, it shows the flaws in himself and how he thinks. Yet, every encounter allows him to build on his understanding of being a hero and the world around him. With this, Midoriya can release that true and tried raw emotion of his, to get his point across to those around him.
	A lot of this show is predicated on discovering what it means to be a hero. They take villains who are not mere caricatures, but hold their own ideals, and juxtaposes it against the heroes. Not just villains against heroes, but heroes pitted against each other too. What does it mean to be a hero? What should a hero do and not do? Are their limits to what a hero should be? Is it passion or power that drives a hero? Questions like these are constantly asked, but none of them in a heavy-handed way. It is all through the actions of the characters that we come to these questions. All of this through the lens of the infinitely lovable character of Midoriya who now must deal with the new challenges of what it means to be a hero and how will he learn to deal with his new power. While Midoriya is not a character that strays from the norm, I find it quite fitting that we see this story through his eyes. What undercuts all this is raw emotion. Something that I’ve been talking about a lot here. When you see Midoriya cry after finally getting his quirk and scream when he finishes his training; when you see All-Might jump into battle after being inspired by Midoriya; when Bakugo walks off, all torn up in tears from realizing that his whole perception of life was misinformed. That is raw emotion. Pushing through despair; reflecting on your roots; having to humble yourself and reconcile with the truth. All this is the catalyst through which growth can be realized. The growth of building your confidence for becoming a hero; the growth of passing down your power and having to mentor others; the growth of accepting the truth and working towards what you thought you were. When you reach the moment of the growth of a character reaching its mark, you are left with an emotion and an idea. An idea and emotion that exists in that world and comes to a head back in reality. So, go out, go out and watch this show; be a hero through their scope. It may not be perfect, but it’s truly great.",8,TheRenegader

                At first, I wanted to post a review from the first 3 episodes but since I haven't read the manga I decided to hold my urge until the end of the series.
The only thing someone really needs to know before he/she starts watching the series is that it's a typical shounen with all the typical characteristics a shounen has. It has a wimpy, whiny but bold protagonist who is recognized and gets laughed at the same time, mostly for his courage. It has incredibly strong and caring characters who serve as role models for everyone (especially to our protagonist). And it has extremely evil, ruthless
                  and ""terrifying"" villains.
If you are someone who's seen this a thousand times before and you're sick of watching the same formula over and over again, then this show is NOT for you.
If you, on the other hand, are someone who's seen this a thousand times before and you can't get enough of it then this show is one you will definitely enjoy.
Story (7)
These first 13 episodes are just an introduction, as the show itself says so repeatedly at the end including an announcement of a 2nd season (and a 3rd season after that, I'm sure). So know that there's still a lot of ground left to cover.
Here you'll see the early days of Midoriya before and after he enters UA High School and watch him gain the attraction of friends and foes alike due to his overwhelming amount of potential.
The show did a great job of keeping me coming back after each episode to see what Midoriya will pull off next. (literally!) The fight scenes were extremely pleasant -well choreographed and thought out-. Although there wasn't too much detail put in the overall scenario.
Art & Sound (9 | 10)
The atmosphere in the show sound-wise is very well done. For a super hero series, the soundtracks before a fight put you in the mood for some action and as they progress into the fight they can really make you sit at the edge of your seat. The sound effects are also very appropriate for action (punch, dash, super powers, high jumps etc.)
When it comes to art... well, Bones know how to do their job. A lot of fans from the manga have said they're doing the series a favor with such high quality animation. Attention to detail and a bright color palette make watching the show a treat to the eyes.
Characters (6)
Not much to say here. As I said, you got a weak protagonist in strenght and character but with huge potential (Midoriya). A cute and caring female who's a close friend to Midoriya. An oversensitive, resentful rival who's angry at Midoriya all the time for no particular reason. And a bunch of other more or less emotional characters (depending on their strenght) to whom the show doesn't focus on very much probably because it wants to showcase Midoriyas struggle.
Enjoyment (10) | Overall (8)
As you can see the show has its weaknesses, of course. So it's in the viewer's hands to either forgive or condemn these flaws. Personally, I forgive them. Just because I believe the positives outvalue the negatives. For someone else, it might be the complete opposite. As I said in the beginning of this review, it really depends if you want to sit and watch another stereotypical shounen. And if you want to, then this might be one of the best shounen you've seen so far.",8,SainanFire

                ""Can someone without a quirk become a hero like you?""
Boku no Hero Academia, or My Hero Academia is the One Punch Man of this season that is nothing at all like One Punch Man.  What I mean is that almost everybody has been hyping up the manga ever since it's release in 2014.  I'm not a huge manga reader, so MHA is completely new to me, and when this anime appeared in the Spring 2016 season, I decided to add it to my list of anime that I would watch that season, and what did I think? Well, let's find out.
Story: 6/10
In a
                  world where a majority of Earth has superpowers, otherwise known as Quirks, one of the 10% of Quirkless, known as Midorya Izuku, or Deku as his classmates call him, is a complete fanboy for the heroes of the world.  He's especially fond of the Symbol of Peace, All Might, who is his inspiration to become a hero, despite his lack of powers.  The story of the anime is very simple, an eager teenager wants to become a hero, and this isn't something that we haven't seen before, so if you're expecting something different from the Shounen genre, you won't find it in My Hero Academia.  However, if you're fine with these types of stories, you won't have a problem here.
Art/Sound: 8/10
Bones Studio.  Must I say more?  With some exceptional series in the past like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Eureka Seven, it's no surprise at this point that Bones is reliable when it comes to action anime, so it gets a plus on my part.  Also, the terribly named Porno Graffiti did an excellent job with the anime's opening: ""The Day.""  Upbeat and catchy, I saw myself watching the opening every time I watched a new episode, and it reminded me of why I still watched the show like I did.
Characters: 7/10.
Oh boy, are there a lot of characters in this anime.  While they don't try to overload you with characters, the anime does do a good job at introducing characters and giving them some interesting personalities.  One character I liked the most was Iida; I liked his strict and serious attitude, and some of the funniest moments came from when he would take a situation way too seriously, like explaining how ""prestigious"" his school is.  However, the main characters aren't all that bad either.  Young Midorya isn't an overpowered badass like you may think he is, he has his flaws, he feels emotions, and he stands up to his fears even if it means he'll damage his body even further.  Some characters show up from time to time, but you never get to know the characters further, only their powers.  Some characters get the spotlight, some don't; it's that simple.  One character I thought would get more screen time and even possibly win best girl of the show was Mina, who is some sort of alien-like character.  She stood out the most out of the side characters, and it's a shame that she didn't get as much screen time as she could have, considering 3 other characters got as much attention as Iida, Bakugou, or Uraraka.   Speaking of which, out of all the main characters that I had a problem with, Bakugou was the one I had the most issues with.  Throughout the entirety of the anime, it's proven time and time again that he's only there to be a rival, nothing more, nothing less.  We never see any sort of compassion from him, even during the final scenes, the only hints of character development we see are when he fights alongside Deku.  Anyways, i'm rambling too much, let's move on to the final verdict.
Final Verdict:
My Hero Academia may come off as cliche for a lot of viewers.  The story is nothing we haven't seen before, and in an era when superhero-related media is extremely common, this anime may come off as just another attempt at attracting people into the anime/otaku community.  However, I can't say that My Hero Academia was terrible, either.  I liked most of the characters to an extent, the soundtrack was solid, the art-style appealed to the anime, and the story is fairly solid.  Overall, I enjoyed this anime all the way through despite it's hit or miss characters, and with the second season coming soon, I have no doubt in my mind that this anime will have a nice and comfy spot on my anime shelf.

                I hope no one takes any offence since its my personal view on BNHA...So now lets get to the review!May contain spoilers but nothing so important.Any suggestions are appreciated.
Story 6/10
The story was pretty ordinary nothing out of the blue.It was a typical shonen story about a powerless guy becoming powerful.Sure there were some twists and turns here and there but for the most part it was predictable.Plus this was a short series so one cannot expect a lot of content.To put it in simple terms the story was basically Hero Vs Villain.Duh!?
Art 9/10
Studio Bones did a great job with the artwork.If there was one thing
                  which covered for the lack of a solid story it was artwork.The action scenes were well planned and properly designed..So props to them.
Sound 8/10
The soundtrack was good.It pushed you to the edge of the seat and kept you hooked.But there weren't many soundtracks.Still the select few were good enough to keep  you excited till the end of the series.
Characters 6/10
There were many characters.But Izuku and All Might ate up most of the screen time in what was a short series.Plus hyping up the main character for whatever he did was annoying.I dint really like the main character.He was crying for most of the time xD. There were some interesting characters never-the less which made you watch the show.Plus poor villains.
Enjoyment 6/10
I think for the first timers this show would have provided so much enjoyment but for those who have seen Naruto,DBZ,One piece,HxH etc,. NOT much.The predictable story dint make me impatient for the next week's episode.Example: The strongest hero is yet to arrive and the main character is about to get killed.What happens?
Overall 7/10
I dint feel any emotional connection with the characters or the series which was the biggest drawback.But if you are looking to kill some time this is a good show to watch.
Hopefully the second season gets better.",7,Nish_Darkknight

                On paper, this anime sounds like a very generic, shounen one, and that's because it is, but there's something about this anime that somehow makes it also unique and different — the main character is relatable. In previous shounen anime, the main character was one of very few archetypes. He would either be the cocky, overly confident protagonist or the overly annoying, has-to-yell-everything protagonist (I'm looking at you Naruto and Asta!). In this anime, Deku is neither of them; he's just a regular, run-of-the-mill boy who wants to be just like his role model. Now tell me that doesn't make you say/think, ""I relate to him.""
                  And then tell me that when Deku is told that he can never be like his role model, you didn't say/think, ""Ok, now I *really* relate to him."" The reason why this anime is so great and popular is because even though it is over the top and fictional, there are moments in the anime where we can all connect and relate to in our lives. This anime is generic and basic, but it's got heart and soul.",10,Denboro

                i want to get all my thoughts purely based on the first season here. not counting the second or third season. so keep that in mind before people yell at me that i didn't give this season a higher score. and one of the many reasons for that, was that i dropped it. not the season itself, just in-between. after season 2 came out, i just didn't watch it. which is weird because i do enjoy the first season.
when i first heard about this show, i was already knowing i could enjoy it. im a bit of fan of superhero and those type of movies/tv
                  shows are what i've grown up with. and while i was watching the show, i really couldn't help but the set-up of ""the person who has no powers but gets power somehow"" sounded familiar. which, of course, was captain america.
and the way it was introduced as well as the world (which reminds me a lot of one punch man) was set up a lot like solo movie. and mordiya though shares a lot of traits of steve rodgers (before winter solider) but has a spider-man innocence and level of reliability. which also works because of midordiya and all-might's relationship also reminds me of tony stark and peter parker in spider-man homecoming. of course, they arent completely alike. but it's still fun to compare.
but more of midoriya, which could be much a problem. since this seemed to act more like a solo movie. there wasn't as much attention to secondary characters. this is of course fixed in the other seasons but it was something that i wanted more of in the first season. especially with bakugou. because it seemed that he was the sort of the villain of the season, at least for the first half. and even so, after we got introduced to the real villain, i still had a bit of hate for the character, which again the next seasons fixed, but ifelt that with more screen time it wouldn't have taken me as long as it did for me to actually like him. and of course all-might who even didn't get enough screen-time either. his relationship with midoriya could've been more deeply explored and could have been given a bigger pay-off in whats to come in the later seasons.
i bet that if the other seasons were not out and that i haven't already seen them. the scores would've been higher. but i think that's purely not a bad thing. that just means the next seasons are just better. so if you think you might have the slightest interest to keep watching then i fully encourage you to do so, because in my personal opinion. the show just gets better and better.",7,crownedalien

                Imo the show kneecapped itself the moment Deku was given the quirk. Shonen is all about earning your power yourself and mastering it and the journey in that growth.
 From the get go supposedly what makes Deku the most qualified person is that he wants to be a hero despite not having power but in the show there's an entire police force of quirkless people that are motivated to serve others as much as Deku was so if All Might wanted to choose a quirkless kid there's really no reason for it to be Deku in particular. He could've just secretly chosen the best police
                  officer since that just seems like the rational course of action if he was looking for a quirkless person with a strong sense of selflessness and civil duty. Deku's love for heroes doesn't really seem like a rare thing either. I'm pretty sure any young boy would also be obsessed with heroes and it's not like All might couldn't give his power to someone that already have a quirk so why not just give it to someone that has the proper motivation and could use All for One in conjunction with another power that compliments it well. Basically I don't really see Deku as an interesting or compelling character, I don't see any reason he was chosen in particular (other than it being forced by the narrative) and I don't care about his journey because he's just not an entertaining character.
Another thing that fucked the show is the contradiction in theme. In the first season one of the most emotional moments is Deku crying with the revelation that even he can be a hero. But really he could only become a hero because All Might chose him. The theme that anyone could be a hero is completely killed here. Anyone can be a hero if they're at the right place at the right time and the person that's choosing who gets the quirk pities them more than they care about doing the best they could possibly do with their duty. Fuck the police officers that probably went through a similar origin story to Deku and just came to terms with their lack of a quirk and decided to do the best that they could do within their limits I guess.
Yet another thing I dislike about HeroAca is Deku's power. We already know what the power can be used for, so there's no real intrigue. Because of this Deku's development isn't interesting we know he's going to use it until he gets good at it. There are no powered up forms that he can enter or new techniques to develop just brute force. Yeah powered up forms are a icky but it's marginally more interesting than having a power with no cool techniques.
 There may be villains but we know there will be no real consequences since Deku becomes the number one hero anyway. 
Glaring plothole break: If Deku needs to be a good vessel to carry All for One how the hell is All Might carrying it. Dude is as lanky as a stick bug. Unless the muscles that he has in his All Might form are his in that case how the fuck does that work. 
The characters aren't even likeable in this show. They're all really simple, uninteresting characters. No one is asking anyone to reinvent the wheel with characters just make them feel human rather than husk-like. Deku wants to be a hero and is hardworking, Uraraka is also hard working and wants to support her family, Bakugo has a complex about being superior to everyone else especially Deku. Pretty much every character is really simple including the main character. I'm ok with side character's not being detailed in shonen of the focus is on the development of the main character but at least make the MC interesting. I'll compare this to something recent like Darling in the Franxx that while having characters that are generic the characters are at the very least written in a way that makes me care about them. Hiro is a pretty basic guy on the surface level, he wants to protect Papa and he cares about his friends. But his character reflects one of the central thematic conflicts of the story: Humanization vs Dehumanixation. In a world where children are assigned numbers he gives people names. Names being a concept that gives something a unique identity. Basically the children are treated like live stock while Hiro sees them as deserving of being treated like people. This idea contrasts with Hiro's ideals when it comes to piloting Franxx. He thinks that if you can't pilot you may as well be dead since you're useless to Papa. This conflict in his character reflects how he is affected by his interpersonal relationships and the society he lives in. His development as a character furthers the thematic conflict of the show which is what makes his character interesting. This, again, is compared to Deku who might reflect the societal ideal of having a cool quirk and hero, howerver, instead of defying this flawed ideal as a character he fully embodies it. When he had no quirk he was a worthless loser, now that he has a quirk he's a really popular hero (socially) only out-shined by Mr. Fire and Ice because he can use his power without breaking himself.
HeroAca has a few things going for it. The chaacter designs are pretty cool and I see no issue with the quirk being somewhat spoiled since I'm a believer in the value of how they use quirk being matters. One might ask why I bashed Deku's power for being predictable is not only is the nature of the power really limited on what can be done but since it's the type of power that's passed down All Might will probably teach Deku all the techniques that there are to learn although there isn't really many to be had anyway.
Another thing it has going for it is the theme of not all heroes are ""good"". Endeavor for instance is abusive and manipulative to forward his own goal of being the number one hero and Iida and his brother do what they do because it's a family thing. Point being that the motives for being heroes are selfish. Stain was an overdone but still quality villain.
Another side note: An official ranking system for heroes is fucking stupid. There's no use in explicating the most able hero a hero system would just need to know who's strong enough to handle certain type of scenarios. I can see an unofficial ranking system by fans or tabloids or something but there's no point in enumerating ability. Also the HeroAca system is never really explained is it based on ability or is it based on number of people saved? Is it a One Punch Man deal where your rank is upgraded by the level of threats you naturalize?
Anyway despite it's flaws the show doesn't offend me and is well put together visually. When I started this rant I originally gave the show a 7 because it was alright and I was putting funish harems at 6. This show is the second to make me consider fixing my rating system but I'm too lazy. Either way I'm thinkin this show is a 6 due to it's boring cast, bad premise theme combination and general plot holes.",6,VainderMuffin

The greatest heroes in my life are none other than my parents.
They have taught me that understanding wins arguments and kindness wins hearts. They have picked me up when I am sick, and they have looked after me as I have accomplished my goals. And they have always made sure that, no matter what, I am loved unconditionally.
They can’t fly in the sky, and they certainly don’t wear capes. But they are heroes. My heroes.
A sentiment Boku no Hero Academia would more than advocate.STORY
Izuku Midoriya, otherwise known as Deku, lives in a world where people manifest powers known simply as Quirks. Unfortunately for Deku, his never manifested, forcing on him the Quirkless moniker. Yet a fateful encounter with All Might – the best hero ever and Deku’s idol – grants Deku the opportunity to finally become the hero he has always dreamed of being.
Boku no Hero has many parts worth praising.
One can praise the battles. They each have a purpose in the context of the show: getting the initial meeting with All Might, Deku’s duel with Bakugou, and the students’ first real taste of danger and villainy. Not to mention that they are filled with awesome moments, like Deku’s upwards Delaware Smash to win the mock-hero test or the group working together to let Iida escape to get backup.
One can praise the comedy. While nothing gut-busting occurs, the anime has its share of silly jokes despite all the drama. Ochako tossing her baseball and earning a score of infinity or Deku and Asui (sorry, meant Tsu) looking unimpressed by Mineta’s sticky balls get the audience laughing through good timing and good usage of the Quirks.
One can praise those Quirks. There are the standard super-strength, speed buffs, and invisibility. But then there is the duo ice-and-fire combo. The black hole. The literal controlling of bullets. Plus, the anime combines these Quirks in creative ways like when Momo creates a nonconducting shroud so that Denki can electrify their enemies. Clearly, the show presents a variety of unique and interesting abilities throughout the whole season.
Now, criticisms exist for these separate parts. The fights involving Shigaraki rely too much on the saved-in-the-knick-of-time cliché. The comedy doesn’t always stick. A sizable portion of the Quirks are not used to their fullest extent. But these problems are not so glaring that they defeat their overall nice amount of execution.
The fights, the comedy, the Quirks. All noteworthy. But Boku no Hero’s best, its most important accomplishment is something sincerer.
It is a story about heroes. More specifically, it’s a story about Deku becoming a hero. As the anime shows, one can be a hero with granite arms. Or with frog-like moves. Or with electricity. That certainly makes one a hero.
But to truly be a hero, it requires determination. It requires courage. It requires doing the right thing not because it’s the right thing to do – but because one can.
And so, the description of the story has to change once more because Deku has always been a hero.
That is, this story is about what it means to be a hero. Saving one’s childhood friend from the clutches of despair. Protecting a fellow student, thereby sacrificing one’s chances at his or her dreams in the process. Risking it all, despite knowing the danger, to let his mentor live on.
Being a hero is more than just having a cool Quirk. Being a hero means being a good person.
So, from the Quirk to the Quirkless, everyone can be a hero. That’s the show’s message.
And that’s just awesome.
The show does have trouble in the drama department when Deku yells and cries way too much and Bakugou spouts incessant dialogue about killing and being better than everyone. It gets old fast. Episode seven, where the two basically duel one another, is especially guilty.
Regardless of this issue, the anime’s focus on establishing its setting and ideas in this first season demonstrate its own Quirk: telling a fun and thoughtful story.
ANIMATION
Boku no Hero is mixed when it comes to its art and its animation.
Easily at the top are the character designs. Especially the superhero outfits. While perhaps expected, the colorful clothes and specialized accessories not only highlight their respective personalities but also invoke a sense of fun and wonder.
For example, Shouto’s fire-and-ice outfit makes him simultaneously cool and fiery (in more ways than one). Bakugou’s grenade gloves fit his explosive ability. And Recovery Girl’s syringe hairpiece and lab coat give her that relevant doctor look.
Not to be outdone are the villains. Shigaraki’s creepy hands, Noumu’s exposed brain, and Kurogiri’s phantasmal existence make it clear that these baddies mean business.
The best, however, goes to All Might. His massive muscles, the extreme shadowing that covers his eyes and part of his face, and his different outfits (yellow suit, red-and-blue hero garb, etc.), alongside his big, beaming smile, paint him as the friendly giant and Symbol of Peace he is known to be. Not to mention his decrepit persona, with its lanky, jagged appearance, that contrasts well with his buff self.
Actual animation likewise remains high throughout the season. Deku rocking in his chair. Ochako smashing debris with an improvised baseball bat. All Might going berserk during his first true fight. Lots of battles and moments give the anime the chance for a lot of movement – to which it answers.
As for the rest of the artistry, it’s mixed. Lighting hardly plays a role in the various scenes portrayed, and the background art is forgettable. Yet the choreography of the fights is easy enough to follow, and the expressions of the characters (especially Deku) are quite detailed (perhaps to a fault).
All in all, the anime’s visuals are another aspect that deserve some praise.
CHARACTERS
Boku no Hero is yet another anime with a huge cast. But, per usual, only a few of them matter most. In this case, those chosen few would be Deku, Bakugou, and All Might.
From an early age, Deku looked up to All Might, wanting to be the same as the greatest of superheroes. However, he learned just as early that he was Quirkless. I.e., unlike the majority of people, he did not inherit a unique power.
At this point, the anime takes a somewhat unconventional route. His mother, rather than encouraging him to fight or have hope, apologizes. In essence, she loses faith in him, leaving him crestfallen and without the future he wants. For if one’s own mother cannot even believe, then what hope can Deku have?
In school, he is picked on, and, out of school, he longs to be what he cannot. Thankfully, he meets with, of all people, All Might. And after Deku saves Bakugou, All Might lets Deku hear the words that his mother never said: “You can be a hero.”
Deku trains and trains at All Might’s behest, becoming fitter and stronger than the average person. All in preparation to literally eat a strand of All Might’s hair to inherit his ability, One For All. Thus, Deku turns into All Might’s successor.
In a weird way, though, this development effectively resets Deku back to zero. For where he was Quirkless and then became strong, gaining One For All makes him “weak” once more since, as is shown, he cannot control the ability whatsoever. That’s not a negative; it’s simply a new arc for him to follow.
Yes, it is frustrating seeing Deku always unable to control the Quirk. But it’s a process. He is gradually learning to wield it, like when only using his index finger to throw a baseball or when he flicks the lake beneath him to create a swirling vortex.
So, unlike the others who can rely on their Quirks, Deku must dig deeper. He thinks up plans, makes calculated moves, chooses when and where to use his newfound power. All the while, he champions that true-hero theme by doing what he can to be a good person. Be it giving his position of class leader to Iida or trying to let Bakugou slightly in on his secret.
Deku goes through a lot in the first half of the season, and, while he does not change much during the second half, he gains friends, learns more about himself, and slowly starts to take control of his newfound Quirk. It’s a season that starts him on the right path towards the ultimate end goal of being the best hero the world has ever known.
Bakugou is the weakest of the three, but he is not without his own developments.
He grew up believing he was the best. Nobody ever told him otherwise, especially when his Quirk appeared. His juxtaposition with Deku, who was weaker and without his own Quirk, made it all the more obvious to Bakugou that he was someone special.
His mean-spirited attitude and general feeling of superiority likewise made him despise Deku. Bakugou saw in his childhood friend something he had never once had before: compassion. As such, Bakugou’s hatred for Deku burned as bright as the flames that sparked from his hands.
It took losing to Deku, in stunning fashion before All Might and the other students, to finally start chipping away at his arrogance. The sheer strength of other heroes like Shouto further caused him to realize that, no, he’s not the king he believed himself to be.
So, while Bakugou crying as he leaves the school and acknowledging that he lost to Deku are minor happenings for normal people, these were huge steps for the arrogant explosion wielder. And, if nothing else, him falling off his high horse taught the audience a simple lesson: hard work can beat raw talent any day of the week.
This leaves All Might. On a literal level, he obviously stands above both Deku and Bakugou, for he is the best hero to ever grace the Earth. But on a narrative level, he may do so as well.
He does not receive development in the traditional sense such as changing over the course of the season or experiencing a definitive arc. But that does not lessen his overall impact. Indeed, his best contribution comes from what superheroes do best: supporting others.
All Might supports the world. He does his best to protect civilians, lead the heroes, and fight for happiness.
All Might supports Deku. He mentors the boy, training him, helping him, and looking after him.
All Might supports his other students. He gives them the means to become better heroes, and he teaches them in a manner that is both inspiring and fun.
But, most of all, All Might supports the narrative. Throughout the entire season, his character was built up, swirling in intrigue and wonder. The rumors about his deeds and abilities. The decrepit state of his actual self. The carefree attitude he always seemed to wear.
It was all in preparation for his first true fight (in episode twelve entitled, appropriately enough, “All Might”). The gradual hype that surrounded him, leading up to All Might finally going all out, made his debut performance not just an incredible spectacle but a statement. That, yes, All Might truly is almighty.
Compared to Deku and Bakugou, All Might does not develop. But, when it comes to supporting literally everyone and everything else in the anime, no one else comes close to the Symbol of Peace.
One closing note. Ochako has an argument for having importance, too. But, given that she comes in at about the halfway mark in the season, and, during the final fight, she is practically sidelined, she does not play much of a role besides being the main potential love interest for Deku. Hopefully she will have a more prominent role in the next season, but, for now, it’s fine to let the other three take the limelight.
SOUND
The opening track of Boku no Hero instills that sense of longing and triumph that permeates the show itself. The slower first half, with its starting lone guitar and somber tone, gives way to the faster and more involved second half. It’s a catchy piece that makes the audience feel exactly what they need to before heading into each episode of the season.
The ending track may not be as varied in its pace or beat, but it is certainly more emotional than its OP counterpart. The steady drums and guitar that charge forward just as Deku does. The determined vocalist fitting that heartfelt pursuit. The ending bit where the extra pauses compared to before allow for self-reflection on where one is and where one has come from. Altogether, the ED is a strong piece. Perhaps the strongest the anime offers.
The original soundtrack contains strength as well. Not as much as the OP and the ED do, but it is not without some nice songs. “You Say Run” as winning battle music works well to pump up the audience. “Watashi Gaki Ta!!”, often played in the next-episode previews, nails that superhero feel. “Bousou Suru Akui” invokes foreboding and dread. “Hero A” uses hip-hop singing and English lyrics to get at coolness. “Kokoro wo Shihai shi te Iku Yami” keeps it creepy with its slow build-up.
The OST’s slice-of-life tracks are not as strong as its more fight-oriented and hero-centric ones, but that’s maybe expected. Overall, though, it’s a fine heaping of songs that go along with Boku no Hero nicely enough.
(Side note: “Mekamekamekemeke” is the best song title from the OST. Too bad the piece itself isn’t.)
Boku no Hero also gets props for some of its sound-effects. The charge-up that goes on when Deku is about to use One For All. Shigaraki’s neck scratching. (That weirdo needs to stop that.) And the small light-up in-between the A and B parts of the episodes.
Finally, the voice acting performances are another positive for the show. Notably speaking, Daiki Yamashita as Deku and Kenta Miyake as All Might deserve shout-outs. The former for the wide range of emotion he experiences, and the latter for sounding exactly like what the best superhero ever would.
ENJOYMENT
Two characters from the anime stood out as my favorites. One obvious and one not-so-obvious.
The obvious one is All Might. He’s a cool guy for giving Deku the chance of a lifetime. He’s also pretty funny, exploding into his buff body or smiling while blood trickles down his chin.
But it’s that final fight that won me over. I remember applauding afterwards at just how awesome the whole scene was. It was a little lame that Noumu was still alive, but the fight itself still stood out as one of the best parts from the entire season. And I have All Might to thank for that.
The not-so-obvious one is Asui (sorry, meant Tsu). Admittedly, I didn’t like her at first, but she really grew on me. Speaking her mind, saying ribbit all the time, staring ahead with the same expression on her face. She was a surprisingly fun character. Even if she was only around for the last few episodes or so.
(Also, shout out to the Mickey Mouse principal. I’m guessing he’s hiding some super Quirk, like he turns into a voracious, unstoppable beast when provoked. Would like to see him join the fray at some point.)
Those two are my favorite. I do like Deku. It’s fun to root for him: in fighting the bad guys, in getting closer with Ochako, in learning from All Might.
But I’m not a big fan of him still being pretty much useless. Yea, it makes sense for his character and where the story is at currently. But I’d like to see him, in the sequel, start to be one of the team instead of the one-and-done dude he’s been for so long. Because, honestly speaking, I have seen him maim himself enough times already to get that One For All is insanely powerful.
Ochako is cool, too. Granted, she doesn’t really do anything this season, but her laughing out loud at Iida’s attempts at being evil and her resting her forehead on the glass window when Deku and Bakugou are holding a “fated battle between men” made me like her more than Deku.
Besides All Might, Asui (sorry, meant Tsu), Ochako, and Deku, I was not fond of any of the other characters. Especially Bakugou. His constant spiels on killing and being better got annoying real fast. That started to let up (understandably) after his big loss against Deku, but he still remained a dude I didn’t care for.
As for everyone else, their abilities are intriguing. No doubt about that. I simply don’t see them as characters that I will be remembering once the series inevitably concludes.
Boku no Hero Academia is a strong start for this heroic adventure. The story’s message is heartfelt, the visuals and music are intriguing and passionate, and the characters better themselves and each other. It’s a sky-flying, cape-wearing ride that’s clearly on the plus-ultra path to victory.
SUMMARY
Story: Good, while some of its drama gets a bit over-the-top, the action sequences, the comedy, and the fun Quirk premise, alongside a strong message on what it means to be a hero, create a well-rounded and thoughtful starting narrative
Animation: Good, fun and interesting character designs, nice actual animation, but a mixed artistic direction
Characters: Good, Deku, Bakugou, and All Might bring their A-game to the academy, starting the series off on the right superhero foot
Sound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay OST, nice sound-effects, and good VA performances
Enjoyment: Fine, a ton of the side cast members are lame, but All Might, Asui (sorry, meant Tsu), Ochako, and Deku keep the entertainment going
Final Score: 7/10",7,BanjoTheBear

                TLDR; Utterly overrated dogshit. 
Don't take me wrong, I gave it a chance, but crying main character 3/4 of the time ain't something I enjoy nor should you. The story was not even appalling. It's like they tried so hard yet they've just made it another recycled bullcrap from top 3 anime. 
Crying main character like in AOT or SAO, loud and annoying one side character like in whichever anime you choose basically, edgy dudes which have basically no impact just words and appearance so they were useful like razorblades in water.
I mean, animation is good, but thats just not enough to anime being a
                  good one. First season doesn't tell you basically nothing. It doesn't even have an impact to make you go and watch another one. 
Nothing unique about this anime. Nothing which would separate it from other mainstream anime. 
To sum it up - unimportant, boring, annoying and edgy (i personally hate those the most) sidecharacters, main character is basically crying btch, story is non-existant at this point as well, just bunch of stories going on, nothing else. 
I wasted my time on this idiotic bs called anime so you don't have to waste yours.",1,Shiniya

                **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**
(All of season one, not for later seasons)
""All men are not created equal."" --Izuku (Deku) Midoriya
Story: Boku no Hero Academia is a show that is painstakingly basic. Imagine this: There is a whiny young boy with very little base power who is taken under the wing of a mentor who is tough on him, but ultimately helps him to succeed. This mentor helps to bring out the hidden power and potential that the young boy cannot control. Am I describing Izuku Midoriya and All Might, or Son Gohan and Piccolo, or Naruto and Kakashi? My point is Boku no Hero Academia is nothing original, it takes a formula and tropes that have been beaten to death by shounen anime and proceeds to further abuse it to a bloody pulp. Boku no Hero Academia embodies exactly what One Punch Man exists to parody. There is nothing here that you couldn't find there. The only thing that salvages BnHA is comedy, a few running gags that show up now and then. Furthermore, the overall basis of the show goes unexplained. The only bone the story gives the readers to chew on is that ""one day people just started getting born with powers, and eventually 80% of people had them"". We are given no source as to why or how this happened, and what the consequences are outside of villains. Besides Deku being bullied, is there discrimination between people with quirks/without quirks? If 80% of people have quirks, why do villains still exist? Are most of the quirks useless in combat? These are questions the show fails to answer.
Overall, 3/10
Art: The art is one of two redeeming qualities about BnHA, I have no major complaints about it, nor is it anything special. I would say that it's 'above average' if anything. It's clear enough to depict the fight scenes without any visible confusion as to what's going on, but not overly artsy, unlike some romance anime. 
Overall, 7/10
Sound: Remember how I said there was two redeeming qualities? Sound is the other one. The soundtrack during the fight scenes is actually pretty good, and generates hype for the fights. The opening and ending are also both very solid, as are the sound effects. I would say it is well above average for most shows.
Overall, 9/10
Character: Hoo boy. This is where we get into it. The character design is poorly written and consists of overused tropes. Deku is your average weak, whiny character who has to learn to control his powers. It is much like every other shounen protagonist. He's so helpless in the way he's bullied that instead of rooting for him, I just feel complete pity for him. He is rivaled by Katsuki Bakugou, a person that I can only describe as an edgy boy with the ability to blow shit up. The best analogy would be if you gave Karma Akabane from Assassination Classroom bombs and anger issues. Then there's your average love interest, Ochako Uraraka. A Plain Jane that only exists to asspull in tight situations the writers don't know how to get out of, or to give Deku somebody to actually save. All Might is the superhero who passes his powers on to Deku, and acts as a mentor, and later becomes his actual teacher. His power is hinted to be a culmination of many powers over several generations, but it's about the same as Star Platinum when I say it's only ever used to punch things, and its other abilities are never utilised. Shota Aizawa is the other major teacher at the school Deku attends. His ability to inhibit other people's quirks is one of the better ones produced by the show. Character-wise he's aloof in attitude and tough in practise, especially seeing how he acts towards his students and villains. Other than the main cast, the villains have no good motivation, and act purely out of desire to be evil. (lame) Due to very low originality, I would say that this category scores low.
Overall: 3/10
Enjoyment: I would say that this show has very little value in rewatching, but that's probably only because the extensive use of flashbacks and voice lines makes me feel like I've already watched it 3 times. The same sentences are repeated and drilled into the viewers head over and over, to the point of it being genuinely annoying. If I have to hear ""Not gonna happen kid"", ""All men are not created equal"", ""I'm so proud of you"", or any other line again, I'd tell you to put a gun to my head. 
Overall, 5/10
To conclude this review, you'd be better off watching any other shounen anime that came out before BnHA, as they are the framework of the tropes that BnHA abuses. Like an Apple iPhone, anything you find in BnHA, you can find in other anime done before it, and at a way higher quality. All anime are not created equal.
My final rating: 6/10",6,Orisgeinkras
31964,"
                I really wanted to review this anime after completing the first season, mostly because initially I dropped it at around episode 10 or 11, only to decide that all of the hours I spent watching the earlier episodes would have amounted to a genuine waste of my time if I left it with 2-3 to spare. 
Honestly? The fact that this universe is inspired by US comic books is one of the reasons I picked it up after hearing friends and others in my immediate circle telling me how great it was. I trusted their opinions after enjoying shows like Free!, Yuri on ice etc
                  etc and I've been watching superhero shows since I was a kid.
I think my mistake was expecting this show to take its foundations in both superhero comics and shounen manga and add something new to the narrative styles of both. Unfortunately, this was not the case. BNHA is a pretty generic shounen with superheroes in the mix. Even more of a disappointment was the discovery that this show came from the same studio behind one of my favourite shows: Soul Eater. To be honest, I think Soul Eater is a prime example of the 'kids with powers"" trope and one of the few quirky shounen shows I've ever seen.
I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but I will say that there were so many missed opportunities in the story and the moments where it honestly shone were where it utilized the strengths of both genres. All Might's character arc was honestly fascinating, whereas the central plot of Deku and his quirk or lack thereof was incredibly weak. For me, it took the fact that Deku had worked harder than everyone else and made it irrelevant and therefore more difficult to root for him. Later points where you are genuinely meant to root for him honestly felt very stale. Speaking of which, I'll admit I've never read the manga for this show so it may be different there, but in the anime there came a point where events picked up and I was meant to root for the kids in Deku's class... but honestly outside of him, All Might and maybe Kacchan, I didn't feel attached enough to any of them for it to work
This isn't a bad show, but any means (I sat through the debut of Black Clover), but it's just not as unique and interesting as I hoped it would be when I first started watching. As I write this, I'm watching the second season on Crunchyroll and I'm hoping the story picks up from there.",6,kisarachan
31964,"
                My Hero Academia is clearly intended to be enjoyed by a younger audience, but those willing to open up there sense of childlike wonder may be pleasantly surprised.
The show gets inspiration from western comic books, and takes no hesitation in hitting you over the head with spoofing and satire. I would liken the experience much to that of a masochist, yes, you are getting slammed in the coconut multiple times, but it is an enjoyable slamming.
This is in part to the world building, which is the shows strongest aspect. If one was to go into the show with there audio off, they would still have
                  a vague understanding of the plot through visual communication. They use the large budget wisely, and tend to go a ""show, don't tell route."". The setting screams comic book, from the towering sky scrapers to the dark back alleys, and the gorgeously crafted world is speckled with some of the most wonderfully designed characters from recent years.
The characters are so over the top and unique that they all stay in your mind long after viewing. From there costumes to the powers, they all feel like  wonderfully different characters. The main downfall with these characters is shared with the show in general, the one dimensionality of the characters and plot.
Decisions made by characters are predictable, and do very little to grow and develop characters. The Midoriya from the last episode, seems to be the very same Midoriya from first episode, except with a shiny new suit. This summarizes my problem with the show.
It's all FLASH and no SUBSTANCE.
Battles are drawn out, and beautifully brought to life, but the underlying implications of the fights are always lacking. The fights suffer due to a lack of realistic choices made by the characters. From episode one, we learn that Kacchan is a jerk, and Midoriya is a saint. The once friends turned rivals is a tired cliche, and one that these shonens all seem to rely on. Their repeated fights all stem from this premise, but have done little to change or influence the characters minds or directions. They fight because it looks cool and it sells. If you can come to terms with this and accept it, you will enjoy the show that much more.
Themes and motifs of the show revolve that of hope. The show comes down to two basic ideas.
1. Hardwork beats natural talent.
2. Anyone can become a hero
While many other ideas influence the show, these are the points that drives the plot and premise. These points can come off as overstated and pretentious at times, but serves as a decent foundation for the characters to romp around.
It is no doubt, a heartfelt story, but one that is often to rich for it's own good. It's like that piece of cake that is only good sparingly. 
So despite this, why did I love the show? 
Because it's a fun ride. I love rooting for Midorya, I love getting to explore the lovingly crafted world, and I most of all loved seeing all the characters, powers, and costume. It tickles your imagination, and reminds you of days in the back yard as a kid, swinging sticks around as if they were swords. 
This is not the Shakespeare of anime, this is a love letter to the beauty of imagination. Yes the show has issues, but they are issues I am willing to overlook based on the nostalgic feelings the show invokes. It may not be a head scratcher, but accepting the show for what it is leads to a freeing bliss episode to episode. 
Personal Score- 9 (Great)
Critical Score- 6 (Fine)",6,The_Blur

                God this series is utter garbage.
I liked the artstyle and some of the fights...?
Deku, the main character, loses what made him interesting within the first few episodes and becomes crybaby Naruto.
Bakugo, the main rival of the series, evokes nothing from me.
Seriously, I don't even hate the character, he's just a bland and cliched rival character who sorta but not really warms up to Deku.Todoroki is another rival/friend, he's a less whiny version of Sasuke but again, evokes no reaction from me.
All other students are just...boring.
There is nothing compelling about these characters or their stories, everything you see here and more, you can find in pre-2010s American comic books, with better philosophy, better fights and legendary characters.

                Boku no Hero Academia appealed to my boyish desires to see cool super heroes doing cool things. And it that respect, it delivered. The very obvious take on American super heroes drawn to a more eastern style was quite interesting for me. I found myself genuinely intrigued by what new powers each new character would bring, but that enthusiasm died as fast as the new character's relevance. I felt like a lot of the characters had a good amount of potential, but were just used as shells to showcase new and cool powers, which don't get me wrong, I did enjoy, but I would prefer
                  to have a few well developed characters over a vast amount of shallow ones. If you are looking for a show with epic heroes doing heroic things, a rock'n opening theme, and overall awesome fighting scenes, this is definitely your cup of tea. However, if you are looking for something revolutionary, be it a new take on the action genre, incredibly well choreographed fighting scenes, or anything that pushes the limit, you most likely will not have your expectations met.",6,geirgie25
31964,"
                So after a long wait, I finally watch one of the most acclaimed series of 2016, and it was...good; with some gripes I might add.
Boku no Hero Academia, the 'Marvel' of anime? Maybe, but not really. The story begins with a young boy named Midoriya, who is considered ""quirkless"" in this world. Quirks are powers that people are born with and are developed at a young age, but Midoriya did not develop his. From his sadness, he would fantasize about heroes that he admired and even go as far as to write a journal on heroes he found interesting. His wish in life was to
                  always be a hero, and one day gets the opportunity to become one; not knowing what might await him in the future. 
The story sounds like it's riddled with cliches, and it is. But what really makes it are the characters and how determined some of them are. And the characters here are all unique, each boasting their own unique 'quirks'. And honestly this anime does a very good job at introducing what sort of characters and quirks everyone is/has. It doesn't just focus on the MC, yet, it focuses on many different characters and their abilities. While you might see some of the obvious tropes that we've seen many times before, I can't help but just like the enthusiasm that most, if not all the characters have. 
Art and sound are up, and well, I don't know what to say. The art is confusing. Some scenes are beautifully crafted and make this show look amazing, other times it looks like someone was in a hurry and spilt coffee on their tie; mainly because sometimes the backgrounds look very ""mushy"" and just kinda undone. The sound is good, nothing to flashy. The OP is pretty good, it has a nice ring to it, but again, nothing too special.
Overall I'd say this anime was well worth the watch, even if it's riddled with cliches. I think with more focus on a good narrative and less on the stupid tropes that most anime follow, and this series could be something great. I'd recommend you watch this if you like anime like Kill La Kill, or AC. It's good, but not too toasty.",8,PixlReality

                Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia in English). One of the greatest anime in 2016, made by Studio Bones. This anime gained a lot of popularity in this 2 years and many people recommend this anime. I've watched it and I decided to make a review on it
****THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS****
STORY (7/10)
The story is similar to a classic shounen anime. The main character who is weak, trying to be the greatest hero and training to accomplish his dream. In the beginning, the MC learns that he doesn't have any powers,meets his idol (All Might) which he helps the MC a lot, giving
                  him his quirk. The MC have his new powers, enters the UA High School, the best school for heroes, and, last, he made a rival, who is his childhood friend. A classic shounen anime. But, the anime has a difference, the MC saves his rival from a villain and gives an impression to his idol.
CHARACTERS (7/10)
The characters are also similar to classic shounen characters. Midoriya Izuku, the MC, is a brave boy, has ambition and he tries to follow his dream. He is timid and calm, he works hard and he is smart, that's why he made it to enter the UA High School. In the development of the story he learns a little bit how to control his powers, which make him stronger and braver. Bakugo Katsuki is the MC rival. He is very strong, one of the strongest in his class. He wants to be the best hero and wants to surpass All Might. He sees Izuku as a rival because Izuku has a strong quirk ( super power) and slowly he learns how to use it. This thought gives Bakugou a feeling of anxiety beacuse he thinks that isn't now the strongest. That's why he sees Izuku as a rival. Bakugo is smart, nervous and a little bit arrogant. Classic type of rival in a shounen anime
ART (9/10)
The art was great!! The colours and the graphics had a high quality. The surroundings, the body shapes, the moves, the costumes and the characters, in genera,l were great. The animation had a great quality. The details had, also, very high quality. They made a very good job on art.
SOUND (9/10)
The sound was, also, great. The opening of this anime is one of my favorite. The ending was good too. The soundtracks of the fights were awesome. Last, the voice actors were very suitable for the characters.
ENJOYMENT(7/10)
I liked this anime. I had a good time watching this. I, also, think that this anime can become even greater in the future. This was only the first season and it had a great success. The story may be a little similar to a classic shounen anime but the art and the sound make the anime to be different from them. The art and sound is worthy for an anime of 2016. I recommend this anime to everyone who wants to see a shounen, action, super power anime.

                What makes a hero?
In boku no hero academia we have a lot of heroes, in one society where having superpowers is normal. Here we don't need to follow the hero's journey to become a hero, or maybe we need? 
This plot is at least conventional, but conventional doesn't means bad. I can say this is a anime where you will see a little of everything, from sad moments, to overcoming examples, from funny moments, to exciting scenes of battle.
The characters have a good development, even in 13 episodes they already catched me with their charisma. All Migth fulfills his hole of  ""All Migth"", Midoriya
                  showed his potencial as bold protagonist and Bakugo... fits as the stressed boy. Here we have many well developed characters.
The studio (Bones) made a great job, fantastic animation, amazing soundtrack and good VA, also made a faithful adaptation from the manga.
Finally, the most important thing I saw in Boku no Hero academia, I saw a lot of potencial. Keep in mind while watching, this is only the beggining.",9,poticardo

                When thinking about superheroes, the phrase, “larger than life” might come to the mind. With the rise of superhero-themed movies and T.V. shows, it would be an understatement to say that stories about superheroes hasn’t influenced pop culture. Inspired from Marvel and DC Comics, Horikoushi Kouhei presents Boku no Hero Academia. 
Boku no Hero Academia is a play by play anime that derives its story and artwork from the source material. Meaning that the visuals and story is almost equivalent to the manga. The story of Boku no Hero Academia is about a powerless middle schooler aspiring to become something bigger than he can possibly
                  imagine – a superhero. The show follows our main character, Izuku Midoriya, and his journey to become the greatest hero the world has ever seen. To describe this story in other words, this is a coming of age anime. 
With that being said, this type of story couldn’t happen without its characters. There are two types of people in the world of Boku no Hero Academia. Those who have ""quirks"" and those who don’t. Unfortunately, for our main character, Izuku Midoriya, doesn’t have “quirks”. Personally, it’s quite interesting to see the people around him try to bring him down and help him grow. In a way, one might say, Katsuki Bakugou, his classmate, is his rival since he’s this intimidating person who sees Izuku Midoriya as this pathetic kid and is absolutely disgusted on how he aspires to become a hero despite being “quirkless”. As for the rest of the characters, even though there are a lot of them being present in the opening theme song of the anime, rest assured, they play a useful role that gives them time to shine. However, with well story and character development comes pacing issues. The anime is paced at a very slow rate – making this the show’s downfall – in killing the vibe of those who want the gratification of seeing action.
It is clear that the overall design of the show as well as the designs of the characters were inspired by American superhero comics. Boku no Hero Academia is filled with bright and warm vibrant colors that give it a comic-like effect. 
The opening theme song, “The Day” by Porno Graffitti, is a J-Rock track that tries to pump up the viewer’s blood for the show. The ending theme song, “HEROES” by Brian the Sun, on the other hand, is – sadly – a forgettable J-Rock track. However, after some episodes, the ending theme song feels like it fits the show. 
Boku no Hero Academia is a thrilling coming of age storyline about a boy, who is powerless, aspiring to become a superhero. Those expecting a lot of fast, intense, and action packed episodes might not entirely be satisfied with the way the show progresses due to the pacing. However, it sticks true to the original manga leaving viewers – who have read it – to know what to expect.",7,OtakuJKP

                Don't get me wrong, there's more here than a bland anime, but it just isn't anything impressive or original.
This anime feels to me exactly like what Lawbreakers felt to the Hero Shooter market: a little late to the party. There is nothing wrong with the show, it's a good show, but it has literally zero original concepts. Every scene and trope, every plotline and quirk of this anime is either a poorly implemented homage or has just straight been taken from other sources- which would be fine by itself, but none of the characters were particularly interesting to me, even Allmight. Everyone was a template
                  you could take from another show or book, nobody had a superpower that didn't seem logical or ""normal"" in that world, and the writing didn't try very hard to even get the viewers invested in the small amount of world building they did in the first few episodes. 
I won't belabor the point, there are some good qualities to it like its careful animation and entertaining episodes, there are some funny scenes in the episodes I watched but there just wasn't anything drawing me back for more. I didn't feel like the shows content was going to blossom and become anything more than just another Bleach or One Piece, etc. Very disappointing.",6,QuietGrave

the plot is childish feels like i am watching a cartoon . like really a plot about heroes and villains . its the type of plot that a 10 year old might like . there is nothing unique or special about it.
weird setting and world building .
art:7
nothing special
character: 5
deku is a generic protagonist the type of protagonist that anyone would dislike . but i don’t dislike his character that much i honestly thought that he would be much worse . however his choices and some of his actions are annoying. the rest of the
                  cast is fine
antagonists
villains : what’s their motive ? every character on the show has their own motive , becoming the best hero but the villains only motive is to kill almight but why ? they don’t have an interesting motive . they are just written to be bad guys that should be defeated by heroes thats all
the villains are the worst on this show
enjoyment :it was a struggle to finish this show

                Tried to get into it because I was bored but had to drop this because I couldn't stand to watch another episode.
Characters
- Winy MC is so winy, he'd cry if you took away his candy. Seriously. Most shoujo heroines are not as winy (and I still hate them o.ô; )
There's just a limit to how much an MC can cry. I think there's not a single episode where Deku is not sniffling or crying at some point. Don't get me wrong, I don't even mind the occasional emotional outburst...but here it just got to a point where it was plain annoying. Remember DBZ little Gohan?
                  Thought that was annoying? Deku is a 15 years old crying like 4 year old Gohan.But we're supposed to see him as the next big hero and root for him? Sorry, while I may root for a kid that's trying to surpass its cry-baby mentality, we're talking about a teenager here...So it's just annoying.
- Psychotic rival character is case for the loonies
Deku's childhood ""friend"" is non other than the childhood-bully. You know, that one kid that is always portrayed as needing to torment and make fun of others to feel superior? Again... this over-the-top stuff may be believable for kindergardeners but in this case... Ugh.... He just seems like he's lost some of his marbles. And the tip of the iceberg? Deku still idolizes that guy and follows him like a lost puppy. Heck, it's no wonder there are so many yaoi doujinshis about them out there... One acts like a total sadistic tsundere seme and the other like the begging-for-it-don't-hurt-me-but-you're-still-so-smexy-I'll-follow-you-everywhere uke. And I'm saying this as someone who does read and enjoy the occasional yaoi. In this settings their characters are just too much and ughhh... 
- Girls only existing in this series to have *some* fan service. That pink suit with the stripe *cough* slot down there...really? Was that necessary? Those are 15 year old kids. Yet they all have a C+ rag and every last one of them is in the story only to add a pair of big tits and butt. Most of their quirks also carry some innuendos. Like that girl who's invisible. So she runs around naked all day only wearing gloves. Or did I mention the girl who pops out things between her tits? Or the girl with the incredibly long tongue...? Yeah, you get the drift. If you're looking for sexism - here it is. I don't mind if there is a fanservice scene or two. But when all the girls and women are portrayed like this it makes me freaking mad. I've seen scenes and images from other scenes throughout the series and I really haven't seen even a single female character that is not somehow sexualized.Heck, the even have an entirely naked girl pinning down the MC and licking him? At some point that became too much.
There's even this ""kid"" character who goes around molesting or trying to molest females in nearly every episode. This is supposed to be ""fun"" apparently. It just pissed me off. You can have a ""pervert"" in a manga/anime without it being so darn tasteless. Think of Miroku (Inuyasha) for instance. But the portraying and length of the scenes and how they're packed into the context/the other characters' reaction does influence how they are perceived. In BHA it's not funny anymore. It's just plain annoying, tasteless and sexist.
- Ridiculous costumes are ridiculous
I was never a fan of Marvel character designs but this... ugh.... most of the characters are probably designed to look that way in a bid to be ""funny"" or w/e. It just takes off the entire series as I can't take any of them serious. And in the case of females, the ridiculousness is topped with sexism. Every damn one of them has to wear skin tight suits with high-heel shoes to emphasize their tits and butts. Most of them don't even get enough clothing to make for a full body suit, so they have to show off their rag.
- The characters overall lack depth. Even fan service galore manga/anime like Shokugeki no Soma explore their characters better, give them a backstory and motives; make them likeable and dislikeable for certain aspects and all that. BHA barely gives you anything even for the ""main"" characters.  
Art
Art-wise this neither especially good nor bad. However the style is much simpler than for other anime/manga, so it's also a lot easier to animate as you have less lines and details et cetera. 
Sound
This is more or less one of the few redeeming features of this anime. The seiyuus are mostly well chosen and do a great job. The soundeffects are on par and the soundtrack is nice in most cases.
Story, Enjoyment and overall impression
Possibility-wise this could have been entertaining. While it never had the potential to be something I really liked (as I don't click with Marvel that much), it could have been a way to kill time.. But the execution... ugh... From blatant sexism over sniffling wanna-be-yet-don't-wanna-be-yaoi-boytoys... Ugh... I could have enjoyed this to some extent if they toned down the sexism and made the main character a bit more likeable. I don't care about the ""getting super powers without doing slack to deserve it"" part as much. I could imagine someone with a personality similar to Mahiru (Servamp) in this setting for example. He was also more of a silent force type that was hard-working and a bit timid in a way. But Deku....I can only see him as a wanna-be-adult version of 4 y.o. Gohan. :/",3,catonice

                Boku no Hero Academia is constantly on a adrenaline rush. It jumps from one emotional swell to another without any quiet, subtle, reflective moments.
It is a typical shonen anime and the main audience is young boys which both helps and hurts the show. It helps by encouraging charismatic and interesting characters. The action is original and fun. The animation and score sell the scenes to great effect.
At the same time, it is a detriment because limits nuance and mature storytelling. The show has a lot of great themes: definition of heroism, whether people are born better or can become better with effort, the line between
                  good and evil, the role of parents and mentors, and general coming of age themes. But, the show lacks the follow through to address them well and just hopes that the intense music and crying will convey the message.
In the end I had a lot of fun, but it felt hollow. There was a lot of potential for a unique anime, but the creators felt the need to cater to the expectations of the audience rather that be innovative and surprising. It is not anime for the ages, but I doubt that, that was the goal.",7,theboywonder

                ( `=`)/
I think this anime was one of the bests for its season. It could use some work, but I think it is worth taking a look at even if there are some flaws, including consistency issues. This left me with mixed feelings about the anime.
Story 7.5/10
The first few episodes of this anime were absolutely amazing (10/10). In these episodes, they did a very fine job of telling the story and developing the characters. The result: an interesting action-packed emotional roller coaster with lots of momentum. ( * - *)
After those few episodes, the story wasn't able to keep up with its own momentum. It
                  seemed to slow down and become less interesting. In addition, other problems were born. Although it wasn't bad, I was still disappointed by the quality drop. When the first part of the roller coaster is better, the disappointment makes the rest of the ride feel worse than it actually is, even if it isn't that bad.
Characters 7/10
Most of the main characters are pretty likable. As mentioned earlier, the character development early on was amazing, especially for the MC, Izuku. Unfortunately, Izuku's development was wasted in the latter half because he wasn't given the chance to shine. You know how the MC gets plot armor sometimes? Well this time the villains had plot armor against the MC, and it was absolute horse shit. If you could jump vertically up to skyscraper height, why couldn't you jump a few meters horizontally without slowing down 
(9 OAO)9 ?!
Another character I was a bit disappointed in was Katsuki. Again, his development with the MC during the first few episodes was great. However, it seemed like they steered him in a slightly different direction than what they were building on, but that wasn't too bad. What disappointed me a lot was the fact that he also stepped on horse shit like Izuku did. If you're in a life or death situation, don't just pin the bad guy down until he screws everyone over. AT THE VERY LEAST knock him out (9 `O`)----o
I've talked about the villains' plot armor which caused illogical events, now lets talk about the villains themselves. I was disappointed by most of the main villains. Their arc was very cliched, and you could tell that they got plot armored, aside from Nomu. The main villains were accompanied by lots of insignificant cannon fodder who were to weak to let the good guys shine as characters.
Comedy shonen/10
Since this anime has a comedy tag, I'll talk about the comedy. There were some parts that were funny, but if I remember correctly, most of the comedy was cheap shonen style comedy where they derp up the characters a bit to show that it's supposed to be funny, but it's not. I guess it would be more suitable for a younger audience.
Sound 8.5/10
The sound was really good. It complimented the atmosphere really well during fights and emotional moments (especially the first few episodes). There were some parts where I felt the song didn't match the atmosphere, but I don't think that happened often. I see people talk mostly or only about the OP and ED when reviewing sound. Unless the OP or ED is incorporated into the actual story, I won't use them to rate the sound. If I remember correctly, the OP sounded good though. (v `- `)b
Art 7/10
I'd say the art was pretty good as well. Most of the fight scenes or dramatic moments were animated well. As mentioned earlier, I didn't appreciate the chibi'ing (not sure what to call it) to show comedic moments. I probably didn't appreciate it because most of it wasn't funny. There were some parts that overused flashbacks that we already saw, which made the particular episode feel slow and boring. Other than that, things seemed good.

                I have spent more time dropping a deuce while watching anime than most of you have been alive.  That being said, Im not some anime elitist that's stuck in 1995 preaching how OP Legend of Galactic Heroes is.  If you look hard enough you can find something enjoyable in just about anything.  This show is about some shit stain pre-teen voiced by a female voice actress who gains super powers through <insert random encounter here>.  It stupid, cliche, and predictable.  That being said, if your some teenage kid who thinks vaping is cool, your gonna love this show.  I
                  honestly found a number of moments really nice, and some of the supporting characters are badass.  Give it a go, its only 12 episodes. . .  not much to lose.",6,Redruum

                Boku no hero is an anime where it does not just involve the main character but all his classmates as well. One thing I enjoy and only thing I enjoy about this series is the ships. These wacky characters getting shipped is great. Oh I'd love to be one of those wacky characters. I would be like Bakugo but more agressive and only screaming ""treyway"". This iw aht so great about this anime it feels like you are a classmate witht ehse lovely characters. If you are rejected by your class at school this is perfect for you cause here you go with this new
                  class room with a frog, a mad person, a guy who has ice and is lit, and bird, and someone invisible and last but not least a guy with balls who throws his sticky balls onto people. Noyone likes that character because the idea of having sticky balls thrown at you reminds you of dodgeball at school where you are the last one picked and a bunch of sweaty balls are thrown at your face and in your face. To be honest I do not even know why this person is a character but I guess you need some short weirdo in the class. I mean in every class their is that one short weirdo always staring at the girls you see these people even in kindergarden. So the story is a 10 for me because I think it is great how Deku has a dream to become a superhero and this dood dont even have no powers but it shows how being a fan of someone is actualy worthwhile cause you can unlock they powers like link from legends of zelda. WOW IM SO FUNNY WITH MY REFERENCES. If you have not watched My hero academia yet than wow you must not know what anime is or even know what super hero is. My hero Academia is my 2nd favorite superhero kind of thing my first is Teen Titans Go. So anyway everything else is a 10 no need to explain just go watch it. Also add me as a friend on my MAL.",10,YoungChigga
31964,"
                I've always been a sucker for the generic action shounens. Boku no Hero Academia is no different but there are certainly some critical flaws and successes in the anime.  Also as a sidenote-  I love and keep up with the manga, and I believe that the story in the manga gets better after the part that the anime adapted.
To start off, one of the gripes i have with this anime is the somewhat slow pacing. The anime only went through 8 chapters of the manga with the first 6 episodes of the anime. I'm pretty sure even One Piece right now goes through
                  more chapters in 6 episodes. I understand why the pacing is so slow though because the anime wanted to conclude right after Deku faces his first villains(trying not to spoil too much), mostly because that arc functioned as a good conclusion for an anime getting another season. However the slow pacing in the beginning still decreased enjoyability for me.
Secondly, Deku's character (the protagonist) is really annoying at times. In the manga this can be overlooked because his character is constantly played off as being purposefully very generic for comedic effect, though Deku is still quite irritating in the manga as well. In the anime, however, Deku's sniveling and cry baby attitude can be extremely irritating at times. I understand this is all part of Deku's characterization but I feel like it could have been pulled off better than it has been in the anime.
Moving on to the good stuff about the anime, the animation is quite beautiful to look at and I like the way they animate Izuku's punches in superpower mode. Also even with the pacing issue, the anime is still very enjoyable and doesn't require too much mental stimulation which makes for a great anime to watch when you want to relax. 
If you like a nice superhero story with interesting abilities and an underdog protagonist, this anime is definitely for you. Boku no Hero Academia isn't particularly deep or introspective or anything like that, but it is a fun watch as long as you don't mind the pacing. It isn't a must watch, nor is it a definitely avoid, Boku no Hero Academia falls comfortably in above average territory.",8,Emperor_Lyon

Well, this is my first opinion. Although I have seen many animes and mangas to date, but recently started in all this Myanimelist, try to be as impartial and objective about this anime. OK lets start.
""Boku no hero Acedemia"" does not present the story of a little boy ""Deku"" who dreams of being a superhero in a world where every person has some quality that vulve ""special"" and used to try to help others and preserve peace, although some not so much ... the anime presents a story that anyone would say: ""I have already seen this somewhere else"" but still has a touch of
                  originality, entering a nice touch of comedy and drama the precise moments, a loaded anime a very good animation, design aceptabl characters, soundtrack, etc. each chapter has its ""uniqueness"" that makes you stay until the end of the series, on the other hand what most captive of this story is its strange and sympathetic characters, fairly well developed by the author and play an important role in the history. The anime is loaded with nostalgic moments that one more would make out a good pair of tears (I include myself in this XD). Boku no hero academy is one of those animes Encourage you to see the initial work (Manga), if you have not seen, I say this from experience. of course there are lots of things we could talk concerning
Español:
bien, este es mi primera opinión. Aunque he visto muchos animes y mangas hasta la fecha, pero recién comienzo en todo esto de Myanimelist, tratare de ser lo mas imparcial y objetivo en cuanto a este anime. bien, comencemos.
""Boku no hero acedemia"" no presenta la historia de un pequeño chico ""Deku"" que sueña con ser un superheroe en un mundo donde cada persona tiene alguna cualidad que lo vuelve ""especial"" y usan para tratar de ayudar a los demás y preservar la paz, aunque algunos no tanto... el anime nos presenta una historia en la que cualquiera diría: ""esto ya lo he visto en algún otro lado"" pero aun así tiene su toque de originalidad, introduciendo un buen toque de comedia, acción y drama en los momentos precisos, un anime cargado de una muy buena animación, diseño de personajes aceptable, soundtrack, etc. cada capitulo tiene su ""peculiaridad"" que te hace mantenerte hasta el fin de la serie, por otro lado lo que mas cautiva de esta historia es sus extraños y simpáticos personajes, bastante bien elaborados por el autor y que juegan un rol importante dentro de la historia. El anime esta cargado de momentos nostálgicos que a mas de uno haría salir un buen par de lagrimas (en esto me incluyo XD). Boku no hero academia es de esos animes que te animan al ver el trabajo inicial (Manga), si aun no lo has visto,  esto lo digo por experiencia. por supuesto hay muchísimas cosas de las que podría hablar referente a este anime, pero es mejor causar curiosidad a los posibles espectadores... sin mas nada que decir, es una obra que sin duda recomendaría...

                Oops, I did it again…
After all my deliberation to watch something a little more intellectually stimulating, a little more emotionally turbulent, or just a little different, I ended up watching the same shonen bullshit. The same feel-good, superpower infested, rags-to-riches, really well animated, dynamic fighting kind of anime. I guess at this point I should just openly admit my addiction to these kinds of anime. I watched the whole season of thirteen episodes in one sitting. 
Okay, maybe I am over exaggerating a little… 
Boku No Hero Academia is not bad. Hell, I love the damn thing. For the time investment (which quite frankly is
                  not that much), it is really enjoyable. The story is good, most of the character are great, and the animation and sound are phenomenal. 
If you don’t mind watching the same thing over and over again (and I don’t, even though I know it’s a problem), then go ahead and watch Boku No Hero.",8,KingBaloo

                Note: This is my first review so the quality may not be great.
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
My Hero Academia (Boku no Hero Academia) follows the story of a 14 year old boy named Izuku Midoriya, a quirkless boy (a quirk is a super power) in a world where most people have said quirk. This story follows him and how he will become a hero as it is his dream. To me the story sounded interesting yet it was not what I thought it would be. Sadly I was kind of disappointed.
Story: 6/10
The story was relatively boring to me. It follows some people in a hero school
                  trying to become pro heroes. But while there are heroes there are also villains who use their quirk for evil. The story is a relatively basic superhero story. The hero has a crisis. They find a way to fix the crisis or use it to their advantage and save people from evil dudes. And the villains aren't really in the first season too much. Its 9 boring episodes of hero school stuff like throwing a softball and seeing how far it can get. Majority of the story was boring to me and I wouldn't had kept watching if I didn't hear the following seasons were a lot better.
Art: 9/10
I really liked the character designs in this anime. As well as the scenery was nice. This show has quite a cartoony style yet finds a way to make it look sort of realistic in some way. My favorite character design was Izuku Midoriya. I liked his clothes design. It was quite a similar to the UA jumpsuit but had some accessories and was green, although it was basic Kohei Horikoshi found a way to make it look more unique then it really was. I also liked Izuku Midoriya's hair design as the green and black blended nicely.
Sound: 7/10
The opening was pretty good. I think its a quite good opening as the band Porno Graffiti did an amazing performance. The sound effects were okay and they weren't anything super special but never seemed out of place.
Character: 5/10
I personally found the characters cringe and kind of intolerable. Some characters personalities were very exaggerated, like Mineta. Mineta was that pervy dude that makes fan service possible in a very un-fan service show. But I think that his pervy personality was very exaggerated, like pretty much every scene he was in he was grabbing some girl in a weird area. The only tolerable characters for me where Deku, Bakugou and All Might. The reason I found them tolerable is because they were just kind of normal. Although Bakugou was always angry yet I found it funny how when Deku pretty much said anything about wanting to become a hero Bakugou just tried to crush his dreams as much as possible. Most characters were either boring, barely in it or cringe. Only a few I liked.
Enjoyment: 7/10
It was relatively enjoyable from some parts. When the villains attacked it got good. I really liked the fact that most students encountered and fought a villain so you could see their quirks in action and even if the villains were only there once it was nice to see more quirks. It was also mysterious at times which made me want to keep watching and is one of the reasons I finished the season.
Overall: 6/10
While there were many pros for me there was probably about as many cons. For me story and characters make a lot of the quality of a show and story and characters in My Hero Academia were sometimes one of the worse parts. I would recommend this anime for you if you like superheroes and anime although I will say the pacing is kind of slow. This is definitely an anime you need to give a chance as of what I have seen of the second season it does get better.
Hopefully you found this review helpful and thank you for reading it!",6,stone_tree

                Boku no Hero Academia is a good choice for you if youd enjoy a series that tackles heroism and the traits a person should have in order to be an admirable hero. However it's a bad choice if you're tired a lot of the generic aspects of anime that are set in a school setting with a team of kids that train to become heroes and save the world for onesidedly evil characters. It's also a bad choice if you're tired of the bland shy bullied but selfless main character, who behaves like most average shounen protagonists, who start off as weak or incompetent, and
                  steadily but surely grow strong as the series moves forward.
The story is something that was done a lot, or rather, the ""kid wants to become the best at x but he's not good at it"" aspect. Deku wants to become a superhero in a society where 80% of people have superpowers and he doesn't have any. But the manner through which the story executes its narrative and the character arcs of Deku are just well written, and despite using everything that is to be expected in this type of story, it's done in a way that presents most aspects in a really strong way. ..................
For instance, Deku is indeed the ""IF I TRY HARD ENOUGH, I CAN DO IT!"" character, he's got that attitude. However, the story starts from the point where Deku almost gives up on that view of himself, portraying a chain of events where he has to wake up to reailty. But even when he accepts it, he finds that when someone was in danger, he couldn't just sit around and he had to try to do something to help. And he doesn't generically get powers out of nowhere in this scenario, like some might expect. He is seen as a hindrance and pretty much suicidal for doing something like this. But this whole scenario and everything that led up to it show what type of person he is. He is someone who couldn't become what he aspired because he simply was unlucky, that dreamt of it all along, and was shown the reality of it. And then this course of action leads us as to why he wanted to become what he became. It's because he wanted to make a difference, to help the people who needed help in those dire moments, as he admired people capable of doing so. And as a last attempt at denial, at denying the reality he's in, he tried to do what the people he admired thought they'd do, and tried to help and put himself in harm's way. From a psychological perspective, not a selfless act, but from a bystander's, it is definitely one.
What I'm saying by describing the character arc Deku went through is that the series has good character portrayal, and knows how to flesh out its characters. I could explain why the character arc of Deku is even better written than I've already given it credit for, but I'd rather not give away more things about the series than I did unless essential to my point. Anyway, after this short character arc, we fully understand Deku's goal and ambitions, because he was strongly portrayed.
However, while the series does have strong character portrayal, I can say that in this season at least, it had strong character portrayal for only 3 characters, those being the main character and two other characters strongly tied to his development. One character is the mentor (of course the shounen protagonist needed a mentor) who is a genuinely good rolemodel, who despite all odds, people have taken a liking to because of how good he was at his job, but he secretly was injured and he is now struggling to keep up everyone else's expectation. He acts out as a symbol of peace and his mere existence keeps people from going nuts and causing chaos around the world. And the other character is his rival (of course the shounen protagonist has a rival) who is a character that is the complete opposite of the protagonist. He's an angsty teen with a superiority complex that wants to become a hero to prove he is the best and that he can always win, who bullies the protagonist because he feels like he challenges his superiority. What Iparticularily enjoy of him is how threatened he feels just by Deku's existence, to the point where I'd even say it even seems like he's almost scared of Deku. What's interesting about this is that the person who's got the most inflated ego, to the point he thinks the world revolves around him, is scared of the person he sees as the lowest of the low, to the point where he can't help but react impulsively whenever Deku doesn't fit the narrative he has had given him. These three portrayals are strong and do wonders for the story.
However every other character is just... there, and otherwise, Deku is a generic shounen protagonist. He's a kid who wants to be the best, who's incredibly determined to do so, is an underdog, he's shy around girls because they're girls and other such tropes would also fit him well. The villains are the worst part since they were portrayed as... I wouldn't say cartoonish evil, but as people who simply do petty crimes or just want chaos because HAHAHA, EVERYONE IS A BUNCH OF SISSIES AND SINCE WE HAVE POWERS WE SHOULD ABUSE THEM! Other students don't really have anything yet given to them except everything they need at the surface level to work as characters, some powers and some personality traits. There's plenty of time to flesh them out, but how one dimensional the villains felt, and how much worse they made the last arc kinda worries me.
You see, while I think for the most part Boku no Hero Academia had a good story, I think the final arc of this season was what most people are genuinely worried with about this show. I won't give any details that are specific to give anything away, but the last arc merely repeated some of the same points the series has already expressed and featured some onedimensional villains. And the whole arc's point was just to say ""this job is dangerous and now the kids know it. there is evil in this world."" But the ""evil"" is almost saturday morning cartoon-ish in motivation and the only way the job would prove dangerous is there would be permanent consequences to the character's health or existence, such as death, loss of power or a crippling injury. Which I can't say whether or not happens, because not even I know for sure since it's not a point of focus, it's only a possibility. The arc didn't really try to even capitalize on its own message, it merely just wanted to bring all the characters from one point to the next with as minimal consequences as possible.
At best, I think it was an excuse to have a lot of action, since it had a lot of people in a lot of fights in a secluded area, except there's a lot of jobbers involved with a lot of people with superpowers just eating ass and easily losing, making them feel incompetent and making the confrontations onesided. Which is a somewhat worrysome area in Boku no Hero Academia, since the power gap kinda makes this a constant possibility, where D-Listing could constantly happen and fights feeling onesided. Which doesn't always happen in the series, it does have some good action bits that are entertaining and hype to see, with the best being a 2 on 2 exercise where the characters have to capture a location from the opposing team, where it featured some strategical thinking and tactics. But there's a lot of the bits that feel onesided, where, I get it, some of it has to be there, but you can tell me around 100-200 people with superpowers are just gonna be cannon foddering jobbers in an organized attack.
In terms of comedy, Boku no Hero Academia, didn't really humor me because I don't see a lot of comedy in it. I see the attempts of making some characters perverted or shy around women because they're attractive but really... that's comedy? While the world is nonsensical, I found a lot of the things that are supposed to be aiming this to be considered a comedy to just be tools to make the series lighthearted due to how serious it takes portraying its theme. In all honesty, I don't think there's anything really comedic about this show. I find it to be a really serious show, that tries to be as lighthearted as possible, this sometimes being in conflict with its themes. And I wouldn't call a show a comedy just because it's lighthearted. I'm just addressing this since MAL tagged it as such.
While I may have complained about the show's action in terms due to the power gap, the animation is smooth and everything looks good. The artstyle is fairly simplistic and colorful, but nonetheless looks vibrant, fitting the show's aimed energetic nature to pull in the right atmosphere. The soundtrack of the show is mostly atmospheric, with mostly orchestral music and some electronic music influences. It sounds good for the most part, but it isn't exactly my cup of tea, but it serves its purpose.
That's pretty much what Boku no Hero Academia is. A shounen about heroism. It doesn't really try to distance itself from the same archetypes a shounen has, and that might turn off some people, but it does a genuinely good job in what it portrays. If you're not interested in shounens and detest their tropes, steer clear of this anime. However if you do enjoy them, Boku no Hero Academia is a good shounen. I'd say its execution is definitely good for its target audience, and it's definitely above the average shounen, but it still has the shortcomings that come with it, and not a lot of things to differentiate it from the others, despite its overall strong writing. I enjoyed watching it, because I typically enjoy action shows that stick to their point, and Boku no Hero Academia did do that. I think people who enjoy shounens and well executed themes can enjoy this show, but if the flaws presented are a particular hurdle to you, they are definitely gonna be a detriment to your watching experience",8,assemomar

                Actually, we're watching  3th season of Boku no hero,but we think it's time to comment this first season. Now, someone will think that Boku no hero a normal shounen anime But, we think that Boku no hero be better. 
the My Hero Academia story tells as Izuku Midoriya will become a Hero. 
Midoriya is a cheerful but an extremely introvert middle school teenager who feels neglected by the society, 'cause he is born without  ""Quirks"". Quirks are something which has become a norm in the world of My Hero Academia. Nowadays most people born in the planet consist of the 80% of population
                  which mysteriously develop supernatural powers titled as Quirks. With Quirks some people can become a Heroes. Midoriya despite he haven't any quirks, he is fascinated by this world and, he would like to be his a hero too. This is the way of life portrayed in the series, and it revolves around Izuku, who is now one of those rare cases where there is no sign of a Quirk  in his body but, We just only say that thanks to ""All Might"" the Izuku's dream will be possible. Generally, The story take place very good and it give space to every single character, with flashbacks and motivations of why they want to become heroes.there isn't any principal character. All in this series are protagonists. High quality in every single scene, The opening and ending are awesome, The sound track are perfects every single moment in the story. There're sound for every single character and for every single battle and them all very amazing. every character has a different personality and them  can't miss very funny scenes. For finish, We love so much this series. We recommend to see it",10,elenaeteresa

Anime is rife with adaptations. Conventional. Uninspired. Confused. They tend to get lost somewhere out in the vast sea that is this medium. Thankfully, Shounen Jump adaptations usually receive much-needed love from studios in Japan. Though Boku no Hero Academia borrows tropes and elementary themes, this adaptation thrives in its exemplary execution owing to Studio Bones's amelioration.
Today, any semblance of mediocrity in narrative works is lost. Right away, the first scene of Boku no Hero Academia throws in themes of powerlessness, blind-faith, and heroism. The show excels at relaying the main character's ideals, unreasonable faith and determination, and all the emotions that come with
                  them. One step, one more, we struggle with him for three whole episodes, growing ever attached to him and his cause. More importantly, this sets the character up for the narrative, renouncing his previous pathetic state for a man of gravitas and aspirations. He is naive. He is deserving. He has resolve. The first act of a strong character arc - done with ease.
Aside from the main character, the three side characters do not fail to impress. They are the pure embodiment of cool - a paragon of a true hero, a self-respecting rival and a supportive mother. The little details and perspectives they have, add life and make them more compelling -ly cool. Boku no Hero Academia uses their unique relationship dynamics with the main character to drive interest and intrigue in every important scene. Every piece of the show is laid down with either of the two characters or the main character being at stake or in mind. They understand that having emotional weight in action scenes represents a vital appeal in the show.
Excellent production quality also drives appeal. Other than the subpar background art, the art and animation of Boku no Hero Academia are nothing short of stellar. The amount of detail in the character art cannot be understated - facial cues are distinctive and concise, colour tones are rich and profound, and the comprehensively drawn lines and details show cool character in every frame. Couple these with great Sakuga animation and the show pleases the eyes at every moment of every action scene.
Being the studio that brought titles like Fullmetal Alchemist and Soul Eater, there's no doubt that Studio Bones possesses the profundity to handle the action well here. Making use of the ample potential of a Superpower premise, different powers are matched with each other in various scenarios and situations, making many interesting strategies and outcomes. These keep any character and scenario from getting bland and make decisive action scenes all the more jam-packed with cool. Add in emotionally gripping character situations, precise animation and over the top action and we've got a great tasting dessert right here.
The final toppings just smooth out this experience. Themes and values of being a hero are strewn all over. Arbitrary but cool information, lore and history sweeten the world and context. A-Okay sound effects, Ost's and songs set the atmosphere and mood. Moreover, wordplay, surreal and character comedy plays up as not serious or mood-changing dry humour, final touches of sorts that do not really matter to some and completes the dish for others.
Though, what takes the cake is Studio Bone's grasp of its appeal. They focus on the characters, casts the world and its themes aside and over achieves the action and cool factor. To dive deeper into societal factors, philosophy or other serious world issues would be a naive play. To overplay any other side character to anything but tropes would not be wise either. Mixing in every potentially beautiful theme could very well turn the show into a farce. 
Certainly not an epic by any stretch, Boku no Hero Academia is still an astounding piece of art, at least in the minds that are not fundamentally inflexible. You are sure to be satisfied with this work.",7,Annoy

                It's honestly kind of boring until the big fight towards the end of season 1. If not for that I might not have continued watching the series.
I find Midoriya/Deku to have the ""potential"" to be a good MC. But it just never happens. He's pretty lame and a total baby. He's less interesting than most of his classmates. Unlike most shonen MC, he's a terrible fighter and actually is intelligent. I don't mind that aspect of Midoriya though.
The most intriguing student is probably Bakugo, the one that you're apparently supposed to dislike. Mineta gets a bad rap. And while he's definitely a pervert and way
                  over the line sometimes, I do appreciate his character for the humor. I wouldn't at all be opposed to him finally getting his comeuppance.
And then there's All Might. A really solid character. All the qualities you look for in a hero. A true hero. The #1 Hero.",6,HagePotPotato

                The moment I watched the first episode I recognized the main character Midoriya Izuku from somewhere I don't recall. Turns out that I saw a short manga of the few big anime main character (Goku, Ichigo, Naruto, and Luffy) with him again and realized he was from there. And that is when I know that this would be the so-called ""big thing"" in the making. But is it really?
Our main character - timid in nature, a try-hard, and wants to be a hero, but he doesn't have a power called ""quirks"" because of something stupid. But if he doesn't have any power, why is he
                  the ""main character""? Lo and behold, he does have a power - given by his idol! Thus there begins the Hero's Journey trope to school. The pacing of the anime becomes slow around episode 4 at a main character vs rival fight, and while it does flesh out a little of the main characters, it could be easily done with lesser time without dragging it for 2 episodes. Quickly after was a real fight that brought the anime to an end - disappointing due to narration of main character's future self that brings hype to the viewers for the next episode and having to wait for the season 2 that would be happening in the future.
All of BnHA's important character designs are unique, as well as the quirks they have. It is particularly funny to me that every hero is compulsory to have their hero uniform - perhaps to be easily spotted by the others and to signal to their foes, ""Hey, I'm a hero!"" Character development is subtle in BnHA season 1 for they only have 13 episodes, but I am happy that they take the time to explain some of the important classmates' abilities even if it were around 5 seconds long. Another noteworthy point is the heroes understood their weakness and does not go headlong towards every enemy they see - and this is also a weakness to the characters. Understandable. Not to the bearer of plot armor Izuku because he won't die either way. Despite rushing into danger almost every single time, he does think before charging in, making him an interesting character, though often plague with doubt.
BnHA's character design, as mentioned before, was unique to each heroes and heroes-to-be, most of them due to their quirks which some of them I have not thought to be seen to the amount of fantasy anime I have watched. The art wasn't the best thing I've ever seen, but it is well made.
The sounds are alright. I did not pay much attention to it. I particularly like All Might's voice actor who successfully delivers his one-liner well and gives an impact to the viewers and characters inside the anime alike about his presence.
I enjoyed the anime well, but it was short that it does not have time to flesh out the characters well. It feels like a 24-episode anime that was cut short. A few moments I feel that the anime rushed, and some dragged around unnecessarily. Fortunately, it is announced that the second season would be coming and I look forward for the continuity of the anime.
Overall it is good because I like shounen anime and the main character isn't too much of an idiot or overpowered. He understands his limitation too much and doesn't show much of his contribution to the anime at this point, but the foreshadowing of his abilities, especially from the narration of his future self does allow one to look forward for his growth. I do worry that the amount of characters shown does not allow the anime to completely flesh out every single one of them, leaving them being a useless supporting character. About it being the next big thing - well, only time will tell. But with this first season, it isn't enough.",7,Norayuki

                This is the most average shonen in existence. Its amazing, they got a whole team of scientists balancing equations to create the most average show in existence. Average characters, average plot, average dialogue. This is the most conventional shonen ever. It even looks average ffs. The plot is a typical bullied to hero arc, and all of the side characters are exactly how you'd expect them to be. What happens in the plot goes exactly how you think it will go. Well done scientists. You get my 5/10. Its almost refreshing to see a show that lives and die by the norm like this. ",5,kurt6433

It is refreshing to see a Shounen anime take form in an American-esque manner. But like many other Shounens out there, some issues are present but this is masked by other factors I found enjoyable.
Let's think about one of the most famous conflict found in entertainment history. Superheroes vs Supervillains. That's the core of what Boku no Hero Academia is all about. We have a main character with a dream of being a hero, filled in a modern world where 80% of the population have some form of unique superpower. However, this comes with a
                  side effect of other beings driven by evil desires and with their own power, becoming the villains. But before the story delves further into this conflict, the characters are introduced first. They're pretty much eccentric and quirky, which at first I find myself annoyed at some of them but as I watch more episodes, I've warmed up to them by the end of the show. Each of the character gets their own spotlight, particularly with a character in the first half of this season, developing and exposing more of their history. The only thing that irritates me slightly is the repetitive phrase from the main character, but I'm used to this from watching longer Shounens. Oh, I almost forgot to say this but they tried really hard in the comedy aspect. Only a little portion worked and did made me laugh.
Visually, comic-style art is what I thought of when I first see it in color. It might not be a suitable art style for some of us but personally, I found it to be fitting for the theme of 'Superheroes vs Supervillains'. In its own way, it's very unique compared to other anime. To further refine the characters, their designs were made to be really interesting and different from each other. You also can experience the feel of a modern society in which the anime takes place in, with all the skyscrapers, roads, and technologies. There are a lot of great OSTs used, sad or hype, you name it. The voice actors didn't fail their roles and I wonder if that guy's VA has lost his voice during one of his sessions (you'll know what I mean when you watch it). But jokes aside, for the most parts the animations was average at dialogues but Bones nailed them during most of the fight scenes.
Boku no Hero Academia started off great in its first season. Story-wise, nothing much did happen as it focused on the main character and other characters first of all, but it was set up nicely for future plot developments. It's definitely another good anime to watch for all Shonens viewers out there and for first-timers to get a taste of what its genre is like.",8,OVERPOWERED99

                My Hero Academia or Boku No Hero Academia is a series that has managed to obtain a large amount of hype in it's short life and many would Argue that it doesn't deserve said hype. I however believe it does deserve the hype.
Story: 7 
 While yes I did just say this anime did deserve the hype I believe the story is it's weakest point. The story is a combination of many classic anime/manga stereo types they are done in a way that feel new and fresh enough for you to enjoy. This also makes you want to root for our heroes without following tradition
                  too much to the point where it feels like a straight up ripoff. 
Art: 9
  There isn't a ton to say here the designs are fun and match their quirk. In addition I like colorful art. d-; 
Sound:9 
 This is probably one of my single handily favorite tracks in all of anime history.
The OST You Can Be A Hero really matches the scene. in addition the opening is well done and enjoyable and a year later it is still one of the songs 
I listen to most.
Character: 10
Many people Are gonna hate me for this being the first 10 of the review hear me out. I will admit all the characters are fairly simplistic however that isn't a bad thing. Izuku and Bakugo have one of the best rivalries since Naruto and Sasuke and work very well with each other. They both push each other forward towards there goals. The other characters such as All Might are enjoyable a well. They are funny and interact well. In addition Izuku has the ability to make you see yourself in him. 
Enjoyment: 10
And finally we are at the last stage of the review. You may be surprised the series got a 10
Out of 10 from me considering I gave it more 9 scores than anything else. However what really drove the series home for me was Izuku. He worked hard like I want to believe I do and in in the end his dreams came true. This show inspires a certain hope in the people that watch it that can't quite be found anywhere else. With the combined experience taken to account this leads to give the anime a 10/10.

                Personally, I really liked this season of the anime, the pacing is alright and the character design really did encapsulate what quirk they had along with how their personality is. The fight scenes were a bit bland, as in the animations, because their isn't any gracefulness to the choreography of the battles, although, the fight scenes definitely look and feel intense, and it helps in building the story, I still wish the battling animations were more intricate. 
I also loved the opening and I actually went out of my way to listen to Porno Graffitti's songs, which were great. The song also emulated the feel
                  of what the anime was going to be about.
Maybe it's just me but when I saw that Kaji Yuki was gonna be voice acting as one of the characters I flipped out because it just further proves my point on how good of a voice actor he is, he voice acted in a variety of anime and it surprises me every time I see which character he voice acted, because those characters are polar opposites of eachother, personality and role wise.
I think anyone who enjoys their Marvel and DC stuff will enjoy My Hero Academia, because this show has a lot of similarities to those hero comics and movies in how the characters interact with the environment, eachother, and their idea of what a hero is.
I feel like this story is also a social commentary on Japan or even the world, the show hints to themes of risk and reward ever since the 1st episode, in which the Japanese people are a bit more cautious with their actions, opposite to the characters in the show taking their chances to get what they want even if it leads to something bad, the character doesn't have this complete YOLO mindset but they indeed go for opportunities that help make them grow.

                This anime gave me chills, every scene in the anime made me smile, it is that special.
Story:
The story is so simple yet so engaging. Though it isn't something I've seen before, it made so hooked. Midoriya's story made me cry and support him. The story behind each of the characters are magnificently told and they were oh so great.
Art:
The art is absolutely fantastic, especially the animation, though some character designs were over the top, it didn't hinder. The action scenes are so fantastic, you always get choked whenever there's that very suspenseful moment. 
Sound:
I'm in love with the OP and mesmerized by the ED, the BGMs made the scenes so fantastic, like it makes you cry whenever that music plays, or smile due to how perfect the music was to that great of a scene.
Character:
The main character, Midoriya, is so likable, though he cries a lot, it makes him more grounded to the reality. I like how he runs to save his friends and everything. All Might is the model of an ideal hero, amazing and admirable and reckless. Bakugou, is so cool, and it makes you cheer for him with his backstory. The other characters are so amazing and they blend quite well together.
Enjoyment:
If you want to have fun and cry at the same time, this anime is for you. It does not only have action but there's drama and a little mystery... It's so beautiful.

                I remember when season one of Boku No Hero Academia first came out I didn't think anything of it. Everyone was talking about how great it was but I just didn't have the time to watch it between school and the anime's I was already watching.
But when Season 2 came out and it was receiving more attention than Attack On Titan Season 2 (Which I still think is absolutely amazing) I decided maybe it was time to finally check out this amazing anime I've heard so much great stuff about. God do I wish I watched this anime sooner. Season 1 was just soooooo good,
                  I started watching it late at night around 3AM, I ended almost watching every episode before I decided I had to sleep before I died.
Everything about Season 1 was just amazing, The clean art style, the unique enjoyable plot and the opening, god do I love the opening. I'm not kidding when I say as i'm writing this review I have it looped.
I honestly love every single character in this anime, from All Might to Midoriya, Bakugo to best girl Ochako they were all amazing and lovable. Unlike your typical given everything for free main hero, Midoriya is just a normal person until he meets All Might. All Might forces him to work extremely hard in order to reach his goal of becoming the greatest hero. This makes for such a lovable character as you get to see all the struggles he goes through to reach his goal in life, just like an actual human he has to work to reach his goal in life and goes through tons of hardships just to achieve it.
The fight scenes in this anime are so clean, honestly I still believe Attack on Titan wins in terms of fight scenes but this is sure a close second. Every punch just flows so well. It may not be anything special but the fight scenes in this anime have a certain appeal to them, they don't focus to hardcore on fight scenes like Attack on Titan but they sure as hell make them enjoyable and everything just seems to move so smoothly.
This anime is just perfect, everything about it is so goddamn enjoyable. I've already re watched the first season 3 times waiting for those glorious Saturdays when I can get my hands on a new episode of season 2. I most definitely recommend this anime, it's honestly one the best on-going anime's right now.",9,UmbraFrost

                When you watch Boku no Hero Academia, you may feel a void in yourself. A strange one, not clearly understandable at first. And it grows from the first episode to the thirteenth. Whatever enjoyment you may gain from the show is not enough to fill that void.
Then you realize it's a good thing.
That void is your brain knowing the enjoyment will last thirteen episodes and no more. At least not for a year. That void is frustration, and it comes like this because the anime has incredible potential and is good enough to make you desire for more.
I exaggerate a bit, but there are really
                  few blames to put on Boku no Hero Academia. Art is good, even if, like me, you're not a big fan of that style. Animation is good. The score is great and fits perfectly. The story is trending but, like One-Punch Man, it transcends the boundaries of the genre by playing with the rules and expectations of both shōnen/nekketsu and super heroes to bring something fresh, something new, something intelligent, and the entertainment that goes with it.
Even the aforementioned blames we could cast on the show aren't really flaws. At worst they are narrative choices and their worth lies on personal appreciation more than a scholar one. With so few episodes, the story is only at it's beginning, but it's a promising one since it succeeds in every delivery: action! comedy! thriller! drama! But —and maybe this is a flaw— the characters are great and well-written, we follow the lead all the way, but they aren't bigger than the world and the promises the show brings to us. So, even with everything else running smoothly, some coldness lingers. You can't really put a finger on it, but you've got the feeling.
Or maybe it's because you want more and already know you can't have it right now!
Anyway: a kid's feeling!

                This Is, nevertheless, a 2016-ish shounen anime. But packed within amazing graphic plus surprising non all-star cast. A rushed hero in-the-making story with mutant ability.
The story revolves between a life led by Izuku Midoriya in his past told by himself to become a hero like his idol, All Might. Midoriya himself is a basic shounen character. He is honest, straight-faced, plain, strong-willing for his dreams, bestfriend-able, teary, and awkward kind of guy. He probably never jerk-off to any porn in his life except cumming out so loud at All Might heroic scene.
The anime idea itself- outside of being a shounen anime- is one amazing brainstormed
                  combination of many high-achievement comic and movies in the past.
Disney's Sky High (superhero academy),
One Punch Man (plain looking superhuman and nonsensical villain roaming around town), X-Men( variation of natural-born mutant ability. Combat and non combat), etc.
It's not an anime that will be remembered until your great-grandchildren's great grandchildren is having a new pet. But this series is sure a worth to watch no matter what your reason is.
So If you want to watch it (and my opinion)
for the plot: Surprisingly common plot with almost no surprise at all but go ahead (Nay)
for the ""plot"": you can always have reason for this, aren't you?(Well,Go Ahead)
for the art: they pour some big billings in it, great and colorful but in 2016, the graphic is quite....everywhere(Yay)
for the Ost and in-anime fx: Not the catchiest song in town and the fx is just okay(Well, Go Ahead)
for game references: this series delivers so many variants of superhuman ability and that's almost the sole reason i watch this (total yay)
for enjoyment: light-weighted and think-less series if you're looking to take a break from hardcore anime.(Yay)
Tl;dr a well made 2016 shounen-ish-converted XMen anime that's light weighted and good to watch for binging or doing nothing time. A Good Series.",8,SuckataGinVodka

                I'll start tackling into the poor story (nothing much to say tbh. It's cliched, boring and non innovative on any aspect) or the viewer betrayal that occurs at ep 2 where Midoriya tells us that he is already the best hero on the world and everything went well in the end. This is something that every shounen watcher is fully aware of in the inside of their kokoros, but we try to pretend that is not true, we try to believe the story that is presented and we pretend that the heroes are in actual danger to enjoy the story even more.
We know that Goku
                  will come to crush the villains skull and revive everyone with the dragon balls, we know that Naruto is going to become a hokage, etc. It's something well known in the genre but BNHA spoils the journey right from the beggining. It also adds salt in the wound because an adult Midoriya tends to talk from time to time to reminds us that he will never be in real danger (if BNHA is something that's being narrated like HIMYM then why can we see and hear stuff that Midoriya cannot see or hear? Or scenes where he is not in...)
Aside from that the female characters being higschoolers with big tits is disappointing. People told me that the characters were well constructed and weren't just walking fanservice but at the very least on this first season they are.
From all of the cast only Iida, Bakugo and Mineta were slightly interesting to watch.
I wanna see what everyone is such a big fan of so i'm definitely going to see the season 2.
I consider this to be a ""preview"" anime (like Re:Zero where nothing actually happens and we just get introduced into the world). But for being one it was really fine. Nothing praiseworthy (oof i'm lying! The scene on ep 2 where All Might talks with Midoriya was completely enjoyable) but nothing too insulting to be disgusted after watching it.

                “The deeper the darkness, the more dazzling the light shines.” 
In a world filled with people who have genetic powers known as “quirks,” there are professional heroes with powerful quirks who rescue civilians from villains. Izuku Midoriya is one of the few “quirkless” people without a quirk…until he meets the professional hero All Might, who decides to pass on his powerful quirk to Midoriya. Midorya then gets to attend the prestigious U.A. High School to train to fight villains.
Almost everything works for this colorful, fun, intense, intelligent, and meaningful anime. The characters are universally a delight with each one having interesting quirks, which contribute to
                  their identities and help to lend depth. Our protagonist, Midoriya, is sweet but clever and powerful, and the way his new quirk is too powerful for his body, causing him to be constantly injured, is fascinating to watch. Shoto Todoroki has an amazing and horrifying backstory to his half-fire, half-ice quirk. Katsuki Bakugo transitions from being a bully to an insecure hero. Ochaco Uraraka is bubbly but with an undercurrent of steel. 
The pacing is excellent, with never a dull moment or a filler episode. The fight scenes are stunningly choreographed and never filler: each one advances the plot or character development in meaningful ways. Even the overarching message of bettering yourself in order to help others is an important one that is well-presented. 
The only issue is the very occasional annoying fan-service element of sexualizing a handful—certainly not most!—of the female characters (Mt. Lady, Midnight, Momo). But the fan-service at least doesn’t seem to prevent their character development: in fact, their confidence in their bodies is presented positively. In addition, a student (Mineta) who insists on sexually harassing others is called out on it and generally presented in a negative light. 
Here’s hoping to many excellent seasons ahead for this anime.",9,shadowfireflame

                My Hero Academia is on paper the most generic of all shounens to have been made into an anime since the dawn of time.
It has a generic shounen underdog protagonist whom you relate to because he's an underdog who's nice and wants to help people.
It has a generic father figure whom the protagonist shoots for and who will almost certainly be killed off at some point in the series to create room for our protagonist to grow into the strongest character of his world.
It has a bunch of guys and girls, rivals and friends, who are all handsome or cute and each bring something new
                  to have some fun in tournament-style battles and big assaults on the bad guys' castles.
It's in a high school setting but with superpowers and super-teachers. When the high school years will be over, My Hero Academia will end.
And guess what, it's not just on paper. It's as generic as it gets, it's got nothing new, and it does nothing all that interesting. It also lacks depth, even for a shounen, and it could certainly use an actual plot and get somewhere before we get tired of it.
So why a 9?
Because it's the most mastered shounen I have seen in maybe my whole life. There's always a flaw to poke at, big or small, always something that really irks me at some point; One Piece, who has now sailed for the Seas of Neverending, had terrible fights and worthless drama that fell flat because nobody dies in OP no matter how much punishment they take, Naruto went so far up its ass with its Sasuke side and so wrong in its themes it just about shot itself, and even if we go older or less renown, I can probably point out one or two big problems I have with every Shounen that got famous at some point.
So is Boku no Hero the one who fixes everything? I don't think so. I think it's the one that plays it safe and controlled. To me creation always has to undergo a choice of creativity or mastery, you experiment and try something new and creative, or you go for the known ground and do what you already did but better, fixing the former flaws.
Boku no Hero is in every way a sort of weak, dare-nothing anime, but strangely enough, maybe because I've been sort of out of shounens for awhile, I don't mind much at all. It's an example to how to make a great shounen, its pacing is pristine, its characters are all a little weak but each different and there's some for everyone, it has no real ultimate qualities like One Piece' humour or Naruto's themes and ideas, but it breezes through anyway because it's just so enjoyable.
I have to give special mention to All Might as the ""dad"" character, because for a long time most of the fathers we saw weren't quite fathers. They were half-mothers, protective and caring, or absent fathers, but not fathers in the sense that you get as a child, that your dad is awesome and the greatest man ever and that you want to be like him someday. Even from the opening, All Might is portrayed as this magnificent, distant and amazing person, far taller, stronger, more stylish, in every way superior to Deku, and that's something I always found to be enjoyable, this sensation that ""dad"" was the goal post, and that until Deku is this amazing, he's just a child.
Besides his role as a father figure, All Might is also very interestingly portrayed, because he's human above all. He shows off, he poses, he takes his role extremely seriously, he smiles and acts and does whatever's necessary to be the most amazing hero, but he also has blunders, makes mistakes, can't teach his ""son"", and makes mistakes once in a while. Speaking as an adult male, he feels like an extremely relatable adult male, despite being a great hero(speaking as a not really great hero myself). He's probably the best part of this anime, and the thing that reminds me most of my feelings as a kid.
Apart from him, I have generic feelings about the generic characters: Iida is alright, Uraraka is cute as heck, Yaoyorozu is the best, etc. It's not really that they don't deserve mention, it's that like in everything else, they're not really great, and they also don't really have any flaws. I guess Mineta is easily the one character I could see dead fast, he's not enjoyable or fun to me.
However besides Deku, who is the standardest of standard shounen underdog-who-fights-the-odds protagonist, I have to mention Katsuki Bakugo, who is...not really getting anywhere fast, it seems. 
Bakugo has a gimmick: he's pissed off. At everything. He's a guy who would see a building crash on him one morning, and blast it away angrily then yell about it to everyone for the rest of the day. He's a guy who would see a huge gold bar worth 100000000000€ crash on him one morning, and blast it away angrily then yell about it to everyone for the rest of the day. 
By itself I don't mind it. The problem with Bakugo is that his gimmick is obviously played to make him mild-mannered Deku's eternal rival. However, and unlike Sasuke vs Naruto or Vegeta vs Goku(can't believe i'm about to praise Naruto), I find Bakugo to not work at all as a rival.
My main problem with it is that his gimmick is the sole justification, he hates Deku, ok, but isn't there anything else? Can't this character evolve past his teenage angst and blinding pride? Because there's not that much material there. It's gonna get tiring quite fast.
Speaking of ""lacking material"", I'll say the exact same thing about the plot and story of Boku no Hero Academia: there's nothing there.
They introduce a League of Villains and imply heavily that they're gonna be fought until the end of the anime. Ok.
Now I completed both seasons of My Hero Academia, and guess what, I still barely ever saw or heard of anyone in this League. The main plot seems to be that Deku/Midoriya must grow stronger to become a stronger hero. It's pretty weak and doesn't really get anywhere either.
Plot advancement is almost nil and I think it really stems from Academia's lack of courage when it comes to actually trying anything new or deep. The idea of aiming for generic but mastered is fine by me, but when it comes to plot, villain motivation, anything that actually might lead you to the road of idea->ideology->morality->philosophical battle/moral battle where two different characters with two different ideologies compete for victory, then My Hero just gives up. It stays in the comfort zone of ""I'm fun, you're having fun, let's keep having fun and not think about the big bad complicated things"".
Again, after 15+ years of Naruto trying SO HARD to be edgy and deep about what ultimately amounted to a big bunch of people throwing energy shit at each other with weird eyes, I don't even want to criticise Academia for being too cautious.
But shounen is a genre for kids, teenagers and otakus, who aren't looking for deep or complicated things. However they're still looking for ""meaty"" things. Uncomplicated characters is fine in Academia, and so is its simple high school super hero premise. However, if Academia doesn't dare to enter the realm of complexity when it's needed, that will eventually end up hurting it immensely. Its lack of plot is already from that: how can you have a plot or advance it when you don't have a single character with any motivations? Deku, All Might and the others all want to be heroes, that forgettable guy with the hands wants them dead, ok, but why? How did you come to think that? You need actual depth in characters to give root to an ideology, and you need actual ideology for two personalities to face each other.
Academia doesn't want to have any of that. No ideas, no reasons, just good guys being enjoyably good and bad guys being enjoyably bad, underdogs growing, top spots being challenged, and a ton of great music, fun fights and lovely shounen moments.
It's a ton of fun. But I wonder how long it can last being so sheltered.",9,KingHarkinian

                I'll be reviewing the entirety of the show rather than just the first season.
My Hero Acadamia is what you get when you take all things generic and cram them into one show.
Story: It's training to be a hero. We just follow the main character's journey to be the ""Number 1"" hero (cause you can totally gauge how heroic a person can be). Only we are graced with some arcs dedicated to the villains to get some character ""growth"" and that's it. That's the entire story. Absolutely straightforward and linear plot progression.
Art: Nothing to write home about when it comes to the anime and character design.
                  Some characters have good designs, but that's about it. I can say that about almost every shounen anime, that's why it's nothing to write home about. But the manga though. The manga is absolutely stunning. What it lacks in character design, it makes up for with the characters expressions and the details. You can really feel the emotion with every panel and page. I'd compare it to Murata Yusuke's art (One Punch Man mangaka).
Sound: No one cares. It's not really noticeable so you can say it does it's job of being background noise
Character: Our main trio of idiots, namely Midoriya Izuku, Katsuki Bakugo, Todoroki Shoto are blander than a body builder's diet. Midoriya has the perfect traits for a hero (in theory). He's selfless, reckless, and doesn't listen to authority. But the problem is that as a character he is so shallow. He was motivated to be a hero because he once saw his idol save people from a fire though the television. He wasn't being saved, hell he's not even in the scene of the fire. He has so little reasoning yet he saves people as if his life depended on it. Bakugo is literally just Kageyama from Haikyuu, except Kageyama actually grows as a character. Bakugo is first world problems personified. He has a strong ability, very good battle sense, praised throughout his childhood and its not enough. He's both full of himself and insecure at the same time and he's always angry for no reason (which is such a garbage trope btw). Todoroki is the only main character that has some semblance of depth as a character. But it doesn't matter cause his story is a literal rip-off of another character. Imagine this, he was neglected and beat up by his abusive father who was hungry for power, and he resents his father because of that. Sounds familiar? That's cause his story is just a rip-off of Zuko's story from Avatar. Even his design is a literal rip-off. You don't even need to think hard about what he looks like. Just think Zuko but less edgy and with white and red hair. Those are the main dumpster fire characters. Now there are some interesting characters with depth, but we're forced to follow these idiots so there.
Enjoyment: The show has its moment (as does any other show on the planet). The fights are nice and cool, partnered with the smooth animation it's definitely enjoyable to some degree.
Overall: If you just want braindead action sequences then this show is exactly just for you. This is perfect for when you go home and you're tired from working a 9 to 5 job and just want to shut off your brain by watching a show that doesn't need any form of cognition whatsoever. Other than that you're wasting your time by watching this.",3,shadow0130

                Some of the best battle writing I've seen. Not much really... *happens* in this show. But also so much happens. Let me explain.
Story & Writing: 8.5/10
Characters: 7.5/10
Animation: 4.5/5
Sound: 3.5/5
Avg: 8/10In the first half of this show, it's mainly build-up. It covers a lot of time and deals with world-building and slight character development, but also a crap-ton of anime overreaction and excessive whining.
But don't turn it off!! Not only does it consistently break trope, meaning that you never really know what to expect from any action sequence, but in the second half, the writing of each battle is exquisite, entertaining, and a creative achievement.
When I say that not a lot happens it means that a lot of this season focuses on tiny increments. It takes one battle or one major crisis and breaks it up into 2-4 episodes and lets it play out while you're in the characters' heads. While you have a clear main character, the others are well-developed and you find your favorites.
The animation is excellent. The English dub is likely inferior due to the incredibly annoying voice of the main character, but it shines in many other areas. They did not skimp on this show. What holds my rating back was a sloppy first 4-5 episodes, but the show really found its stride and hit a home run to the end.",8,siphus007

                This season of my hero academia though contrary to popular belief felt quite slow in comparison to the newer seasons at the time I originally watched this show I would have rated it around a 7-8 but after re-watching it with a much higher bar i believe it is now rather average as far as anime goes the shows first season is essentially generic Shonen with little addition on top of it.
the end of this season however was rather well paced and set up well for the next seasons story which was a pleasant surprise.
while the animation was good some of the fights and basic
                  animated scenes did come off as quite choppy and i visibly spotted reused and looped frames in some cases which i do not mind as reusing frames is a legitimate technique that helps ease the load on an animation studio but the reused and looped frames shouldn't be easily noticed as they were.",5,Ethansanimelist

                So a superhero shonen, will it be like most shonens were the MC is pretty powerful from the get go for a newcomer who wins every battle without much effort? Wait we have a wimpy kid who does not have any powers? Well ok this might be interesting. These are my first thoughts when I watched My Hero Academia which is the series of spring 2016 that I enjoyed the most while it was airing. 
Unlike One Punch Man where the series has the MC at his top level in the beginning, This series has our main protagonist starting at the most low. If you
                  like series where a really unreliable person becomes reliable you might like this series. If you are also a fan of the superhero genre I think you can find it rather entertaining. 
In a world where a vast majority of people have superpowers heroes and  villains are common. Our main protagonist who was born with no powers wants to become a hero. I got a bit of feels watching the first few episodes of the series when learning about the struggles of the main character in this society. The story is really strong in the beginning in giving what is basically the main characters own origin story. The rest of the 13 episode series stays strong till the end. The story hits you strong at some points mainly during times where Deku (Izuku) Is put down for not having any powers. 
The story includes is share of fights and battles mainly set in the second halve of the season. Some of the fights had a tendency to be truly brutal and dramatic. In ordinary shonen fights are never like that to me because the characters always seem unscathed in the aftermath of situations where people can die. I think this is greatly emphasized in the suffering of Izuku and All Might during these fights and the acts the villains are capable of.   
I have been a fan of how studio bones does the art in their anime. The art style in terms of the powers and the damage caused by and to the characters and the environments reminds me a bit of full metal alchemist art style in relation to the damage with the smoothness of the powers animations similar to those in concrete revolution.  The character designs are top notch especially in terms of superhero outfits. The main thing I want to note about the art is how it shows damage on the heroes. Sometimes its average and sometimes its really bad and gives you a true sense they are in danger.
The music in this series is ok with some good battle music and a good opening and ending theme. The voices in this Japenes Dub especially with the characters All Might, Izuku and Bakugou are well played and suit the characters.
The series being very short managed to create some interesting characters that were not shallow. With a lot of supporting characters only three really stand out.  First being Izuku who is a character the audience can relate to when it comes to achieving life goals. Izuku at first you think he is going to be one of those annoying MCs that will bring the show down but he makes the show by backing up his words with actions. All Might is a very intriguing and humorous hero, If you like the concept of the old hero still trying to live his glory days All might will be a character you can enjoy watching. 
Bakugou the childhood friend of Izuku is not a really likable character at first but he gets more interesting in the later episodes. He is a character with a big flaw in his personality but when he wants he can make up for it. The other characters who are supporting don't have much of a role then to be introduced. Their introduction is not that bad as it is not forced like most anime with a massive cast. 
This series was the most fun I had with the spring 2016 anime. It never seemed rushed and was good binge watch entertainment. I also feel like the series left off on a good high note.",9,Cyborg_Dragon

                Yes it's childish, and goofy, but I'll tell you how I saw it. It's kind of a more realistic take on one punch man. Basically, this kid has amazing strengh bestowed on him, however, his body is not yet trained enough to handle this strength, so actually trying to use it breaks his bones and damages his body.  The reason why this is great is because I'm tired of these anime with auto win characters. I like characters that, though they may have great strength, have to learn how to use it. For instance: Dragon Ball Z. Yes Goku is an auto win, and
                  all of the characters basically see him as this. But everytime an new, more powerful villain appears, we have tons of episodes of him training to be able to beat them. So he may be an auto win, but he has to work for it, and still struggles.
So Academia gives us this hero who may very well one day be an auto win of sorts, but for now his own body can't handle it, and we get to watch him grow as his body becomes more and more use to these abilities. The anime also gives us moments when he has to use all of his power, and does it in a rather cleaver fashion as to limit the damage he would take.
The characters are also crazy enjoyable, and play off of one another really well. There also isn't a real romance here, so the story doesn't rely on that to connect the characters to one another.
Also, the colors used, and the set design is awesome, and a pleasure to look at. The powers used by the characters also feel original to this story, and are in there own right well thought out.",9,Vex894

                From Quirkless to Full Fledged Superhero, ahhh actually scratch that, Rookie Superhero...but go beyond that then maybe...right?
Boku no Hero Academia being under Studio Bones' hype train this Spring 2016 and did they deliver?...for LA...yes ohhh boy did it, but that on that later.
Boku no Hero Academia follows one Izuku Midoriya voiced by Daiki Yamashita a ""quirkless"" in a quirk filled world. Quirks are by definition the equivalent to having superpowers and Izuku wants to be a superhero. 
Boku no Hero Academia has a motto...*ahem* ""Go beyond + Ultra!"" and it shows...
This anime has in early episodes a theme about determination and trying to be heroic
                  (due to Hero Academia's superhero society is largely advertised and have something of a hierarchy) through this to Izuku and it does it brilliantly.
As for characters, there is a huge cast list and with a bare 13 episode limit trying to develop of these characters in detail is hard and even harder since we have a great main protagonist trying to grow and learn to be a hero. For the amount of characters that do get fleshed out were being Izuku's friendly rivalry of Katsuki Bakugou voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto, Ochako Uraraka voiced by Ayane Sakura the gravity user and friend of Izuku in UA, Tenya Iida voiced by Kaito Ishikawa the speed user, another soon to be friend of Izuku and of course All Might, Izuku's hero idol and ""mentor"". For the rest of the cast get are slim as we get to know their superpowers in the UA arc and a bit on their personalities but in terms of character development, we don't get much aside from that. LA's favourite character?...it actually was Ochako Uraraka, her genkiness was infectious...god damn it can Ayane Sakura breathe life into this genki as hell character, as for the minor cast members, Momo Yaoyorozu voiced by Marina Inoue stood out to LA for what little screentime she had.
As for the plot, the 13 episodes really looks as Izuku's trials and tribulations from being a quirkless to be a hero (by also including a ""superhero high school intro and training arc"") and for what ""little"" the plot of Boku no Hero Academia took in 13 episodes it still has plenty of ""meat"" to offer...at the very least.
In terms of animation by studio Bones, LA had no complaints with this anime, from the eccentric character designs, awesomely detailed action scenes and great backgrounding work by studio Bones. No complaints here, just amazing animation overall.
As LA pointed out about Ayane Sakura in ""characters"", Ayane Sakura is LA's favorite voice actor in this anime, however a few more sticked out to LA, those being Daiki Yamashita who voices Izuku, Nobuhiko Okamoto as Bakugo (hello crazed but stable Accelerator, turned hero now?) and finally All Might's voice actor Kenta Miyake doing both his bravado as well as his meeker and weaker vocals that made Kenta standout in the voice acting department.
The ending, brought on a build up of an actually intense arc bringing in villains and wringing in the main hero cast's weaknesses' as well as strengths, Izuku for the most part gets a piece of the action but the build up to this arc leads into a ""sort of"" deus ex machina but LA can give grace to that as this intense arc did go off in a good note bringing in our view as to how evil and cunning these villains as well as showing more of superheroes that are in the world of Boku no Hero Academia. 
If there was any fault LA would have to Boku no Hero Academia would be the ""huge cast list but narrow character focus"" and the ""near"" minimal world building.
HOWEVER, with Boku no Hero Academia getting a second season, LA wishes that the second seaosn expands more on the world of superheroes and give some of Izuku's classmates some limelight (not an entire episode focus or anything but give the more interesting characters from this huge character roster some time in the limelight) as well as Izuku's growth into being a great superhero and with the first season's great impression and all the gawking and praising LA did, well Boku no Hero Academia still outdid itself. 
LA will still say Boku no Hero Academia, for a first season standards anyways is a solid superhero anime throughout and yes it deserves the hype it did, if the second season just get a bit more world building and character development to Izuku and the huge class cast for the second season then Boku no Hero Academia can be great anime franchise. 
LA cannot wait for the second season!!!.",9,LegendAqua

                In a critical sense this show isn't something profoundly original. But, i do think it does a lot of things well and really feels like a melting pot of a lot good shonen anime elements. Above all it was an enjoyable experience with a lot of fun and energy packed it despite how predictable much of it was. 
Story -- 6 /10
the story isn't bad the way many people say it is. it seemed pretty solid, i didn't see a lot of problems with it but it did feel a bit cookie-cutter. loser-ish boy wants to be the world's greatest hero despite having no means
                  to do so because he lacks a super power or ""quirk"" as they're called in the show. he goes to a big academy and enrolls in the hero course, a dream made possible by the world's top hero All Might, who becomes his mentor of sorts. 
if you've watched even a few shonen anime you'll quickly see that there really are no surprises in this show. nothing even remotely caught me off guard, i saw everything coming from episodes away, which for me personally is unusual because i don't tend to think ahead that much whilst i'm in the midst of watching a show, but this anime made it too easy. sorry, but the story isn't the most engaging part of the show so far.
however, i am just judging from these thirteen episodes alone. i have a feelings things will pick up a whole lot in the manga or in a second season. think back to any major shonens you've seen- the first thirteen episodes were never all there was to it.  
as for the overall tone of the show, it felt consistent and light hearted and pretty gung-ho. The comedy definitely fit that and while it wasn't anything awfully clever it was easy to take in and didn't break the mood.
Art -- 7 /10
i honestly really liked the art style of this show, i think the comic book style was totally suitable and added a lot of energy for the viewer while watching. A lot of the fight scenes were also well animated and felt fluid. i also felt like the colours popped out a lot which was good for the most part but sometimes felt a bit over done. 
as for character designs, a lot of the superhero costumes were great and pretty cool, and i thought the very main cast was pretty memorable too. But, some of the classmates like Izuku's friends felt almost strangely ordinary by comparison. But, their quirks do make up for it and their designs fit their personalities to a T.
Sound -- 5 /10
i really don't remember much of the soundtrack at all. like none. it wasn't memorable by any means but i don't recall it ever bothering me either. it fit the show and complimented each scene and definitely added to the hype but it much else.
Characters -- 8 /10
not sure how many people will agree but i liked Izuku and most of the other characters quite a lot. They felt really distinct and had their cool moments, i felt like they had a lot of potential and the story didn't waste any time on characters we don't care much for. The rivalry between two of the main characters felt very real and has a lot going for it, although i'm not too sure how the show is going to make every supporting character relevant at some point, as there are quite a lot of them. the characters' quirks weren't too interesting for the most part if i'm honest but they were made use of quite well in the show. 
Overall -- 7 /10
this anime is too short to pass up to be honest, i thought it was a solid exposition to a story with a lot of potential and i'd recommend it to anyone who's eager for a chase-your-dreams you-can-do-it sort of shonen with a lot of flashy superhero action",7,xhunter2301

                Let's talk about one of the best lineup of Sring 2016 season and also a strong contender of the AOTY, Boku no Hero Academia.
The story follows the exploits of the main character called Deku by just one guy. His name is too long so I won't take trouble writing it and henceforth he would be called Deku. In a world full of superheroes and superpowers, Deku is born abnormal; by that I mean he has no superpowers. He waits and waits but he doesn't discover his powers; though that doesn't stop him from dreaming and unlike the world and he believes that nor should it.
                  He excels in his studies and observes and makes notes about other superheroes. I almost thought that he would be batman, and became really curious how they would make a shounen batman. Enters a superman-esque superhero, whose powers unlike other powers can be transferred. And, then Deku became a superman- esque hero with super strength and somewhat super speed. That made a lot of sense as Superman unlike batman can be a shounen hero. He enters the elite school of superheroes where he meets a rival and few friends. That's a pretty uninspired story and is similar to all the popular shounen stories.  Despite that it also contains that weird charm that all of these good shounen have. Even while having the same overused and cliched story, the charm makes it going and made me want to watch the next episode. If someone is expecting something new or an innovative plot this anime ain't for them. You will find that this anime ticked all the shounen tags quite diligently and repeatedly, and I am not a fan when an anime does that. I continued as I was aware of the hype before the anime began airing. Also, like me there would be watchers who would be excited by the concept of having japan try the american superhero story. I know that this isn't new as many anime have tried that yet every time I hear a superhero anime I become excited and like me if you purely want a superhero anime then this is a pretty good one. Thus, my reason for considering this story as good. Also, another thing that I didn't like about the anime was the ending, specifically where the anime ended. I would have wanted the anime to be 20+ episode one. It had the usual 1 episode random stories to get things started and from there on it suddenly introduced the villain and his sidekicks and their so called evil plan. I felt it was abrupt and it felt rushed. Either they should have taken more time to introduce the characters and kept the last dome training arc for the next season or they should have added on more episodes to gradually set the tone. Instead due to time constraints they had to rush the whole thing and the last arc felt forced.
The problem with having a large cast of characters is to make them all interesting. To make them interesting all the characters don't have to stand out or create havoc to make their presence felt. There have been plenty of characters whose presence is hardly felt yet they create an aura of mystery whenever they are around. All of this can be done by making each character somewhat humanish, a wee bit more real. Many manga writers have succeeded in doing that. The problem with large cast is the fact that to do justice to each character, a different personality is required for each character. Herein, this anime conveniently borrows personality from its predecessors. It's not like that this is the only one. Many shounen anime borrow or steal personalities from the more famous shounen. The most blatant copy I felt was the personality of Deku's teacher Aizawa. He was completely lifted from Kakashi of Naruto. Many more characters I felt along the anime could be found in any of the big 3 and other famous anime. Thus, this anime really lags in characters. Though, I genuinely liked Deku's character. He too was nothing original, yet when I saw how hard he tried to overcome his weakness, it kind of moved me. Also, the fact that he was born devoid any kind of talent resonated with me. I long to see some character development in the anime, at least from Deku, as there was none in the first season. This can again be attributed to the length of the anime. In the first 4 episodes he was just a plain guy with no powers. When the actual story began within 3-4 episodes it rushed off to an arc which itself didn't provide any growth for the MC. All of other cast was vibrant but they weren't in any way interesting. The rival exists just because its cool to have one. To sum it up all I can say is that the characters were all uninspired.
Now moving on to the art and sound, I in one thought that the art was pretty cool. The character designs were all very unique and did give off an American vibe, more specifically a comic vibe. I thought that this was pretty cool and was consistent with the overall superhero theme of the anime. The use of color and over all color pallet used in the anime was very vibrant. The anime was colorful and was very pleasing to see. The voice acting too was good and helped to some extent in giving a different personality to the character. I really enjoyed both the opening and ending songs and was energetic and refreshing. So no complaints in this department.  
As expected of a shounen anime the dialogues shined in the cool lines department. Unlike most shounen anime the normal conversation dialogues didn't suck completely, though they weren't good either. Although this could be attributed to the fact that there wasn't much of dialogue in the anime to begin with. As all shounen anime the best part of the anime was the fight scenes. It was very well animated and was with fluid movements and also engaging OST, which helped create an intense environment.  I felt that the fight scenes were thing that kept the anime going.
All in all watch this anime if you want a mindless battle shounen. And, if like me you are interested and into superhero anime then this is a sweet treat. Watch this and then get hyped for the next soon to come season.",7,CivilianHero

                The first season of Hero Academia introduces us to the show's universe and prepares the viewer for the next seasons. It is a solid addition to the shonen genre, though it comes with the usual weaknesses.
Story: (Spoilers)
In a One Punch man-esque universe where everyone has a superpower, our protagonist, Deku, has none. ""All men are not created equal"" is the initial premise of the show. And though later on Deku is gifted with a power by captain America, I mean, All Might, he still needs to put effort in order to be even able to use his power. The show is telegraphing the viewer a
                  good message, that no matter how you are born, you can put effort in order to achieve great things. My criticism to the initial premise of the show however, is that the message can be diluted by the fact that Deku is only able to become a hero because he got lucky and gifted a power. He then goes on to become the standard shonen hero archetype: a young man with great power struggling to control it. Nonetheless, it is a interesting twist to the shonen premise, but a basic shonen premise nonetheless. 7/10
Art:
Great animation and effects. 10/10
Sound:
I like the opening and the sound effects give a lot of hype to the show's important moments. 10/10
Characters:
The many heroes and students of this show all feel very unique and distinct, so the show succeeds in providing a good diversity of characters and personalities. However, most of them seem shallow and one dimensional, even for shonen standards. Besides, the main characters of the show are a simple recycling of shonen's most overused archetypes. In terms of archetypes, the main character is not very different from Naruto or Goku, Bakugo is not very different from Sasuke, Ishida or Vegeta, and Uraraka is not very different from Sakura and Orihime. Which is mostly fine since this is after all a shonen, but I can't say the characters are very original other than their designs. I feel like a Yu Yu Hakusho for example, was a shonen with much more interesting main characters. I would normally give the characters of the show a mediocre grade, but each individual character's design is very unique and fits well with the universe. We also have some very interesting that stand out such as Eraser Head, Tomura Shigaraki and All Might. 7/10
Enjoyment:
I always find it enjoyable to discover a new interesting universe and characters. I think one of the great advantages Hero Academia has over most shonens, is that it feels much more fast paced. Previous shonens are infamous for the long drawn out fights and arcs, yet Hero Academia keeps it short and sweet. Also, the great animation and sound effects keep me hooked from start to finish. In short, this anime is much more efficient in delivering the overall shonen experience. So even though in principle the show does not bring anything new to the shonen genre in terms of plot and character development, it stills feels fresh and enjoyable. 8/10
Overall:
It's a good show that benefits greatly from its good animation, though the characters and plot could be deeper. It remains a very enjoyable experience and is a good addition to the shonen genre. The first season got me interested and I will definitely watch the next seasons. 8/10",8,azkuel

                going into 'my hero academia' i didn't really have many expectations especially because it seemed like your typical shounen anime so i was basically expecting unrealistic fight scenes with little no no limitations and hardly any character development or at least none that would last to at least an episode later. however i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found that i finished the first season in little under two days i found the the story cute and not too complicated like some worlds that just get to ahead of themselves and make themselves confusing. but unlike that the premise was clearly cut
                  and easy to just flow into the world and get absorbed by it. 
the art was nice and very usual of anime but the very subtle superhero/comic inspiration clearly eloped into the design and portrayal of the characters was a lovely addition making the art stand out in but more in a way that wasn't in your face which i liked unlike some other animes that take art styles from comics. 
the sound was nothing particularly special but i feel like they used it more to set the mood of each of the scenes more than to have each song listened to in a solo manner. personally the music didn't stand out to me very much but i did like that even though the music wasn't to my personal tastes it wasn't in my face and really tended to assist the anime and its presentation in each circumstance.
the characters though are what really made this show so utterly enjoyable for me to watch. i just constantly found myself falling in love with each of the characters even the ones i didn't like so much at first just because i was so immersed in how they developed as people even when sometimes it was very subtle and barely noticeable like Bakugou or even still when it was as drastic as Midoriya's. one thing i loved about the development was that even though you could see them change and develop you would never see one person loose or shift there personality entirely witch was quite a pleasant break from some shounen animes. i could go on forever about how this anime takes a 360 from most shounen anime i've seen but ill just say one more thing to keep it as short as i can; the boundaries that the anime takes to ensure that you are constantly kept guessing if the heroes can actually control the situations, their quirks/powers and themselves witch i found refreshing and interesting.
i really enjoyed boku no hero acadamia because it really wasn't trying to be something it wasn't. i think that its not really the story that is the animes star point but instead i think what really gives this anime a glimmer of uniqueness is its characters and the immersive world it creates around you.",8,mikachu303

It kicks off really well, a bit slow in the beginning, but as you get further, you start to really like most of the characters. By the end of this season I really enjoyed Tsuyu, Deku, and All-Might.

                Overall? Pretty solid first season!
The soundtrack is AMAZING, as is the artwork.
As far as story goes, the show is alright but it really doesn't bring anything unique to the table. Midoriya gets powers, goes to school, yada yada, and then we get a vague introduction to some threatening villain characters. It's formulaic and plays off of a lot of existing story tropes, but it still works fine.
I like the characters. They all have very unique designs and powers, and there are a few in particular that I'm eager to learn more about.
So yeah, that is my very short review. Hope that is helpful!

                [Note: This is my first review, so please bare with me ;w;]
After hearing a few comments and reviews made about this anime; I decided to do it some justice since it was one of the few 2016 (so far) anime that really had an impact on me, rather than being another one that I've 'moved on from' by the next season releases. I will start with the strong points, weak points and then who'd I'd personally recommend it for.
Boku no hero academia is one of those masterpieces put beautifully together, but a few loopholes take that away. The anime really brings the manga to life:
                  fight scenes are intensified, sad backstories were heart touching, characters are emphasized to their best potential (only to the extent of the manga, as a few characters haven't been properly touched on yet) - The producers of the anime knew what they were doing. In my opinion, the art style is beautiful: It's vibrant, it portrays detail and shows a strong resemblance to American cartoons. When you compare to other anime, truth to be told, it may not stand out much, however, I strongly believe that an anime shouldn't be judged by its art. There are anime out there with the most stunning visuals mankind has ever seen, but they are not worth your time (which is a shame really, but it cannot be helped); Boku no hero is not one of those. I feel like this anime really stands out with its hyped up 'superhero themed' music and I believe that it beats One punch man in that aspect. 
On the other hand, I can see why this anime is not everyone's cup of tea: the plot is kind of off putting for the anime community where everyone expects seriousness or some kind of fan service merit, which this anime does not offer. The characters are good; but none of them are particularly outstanding enough to pick a favorite from (but that may just be me). I wish this anime had a bit more to offer rather than it's plot, which was one of the lower points of the anime. You can see the dense influence of American comics in this anime; which probably makes it more suitable for western viewers rather than us weaboos. XD
I recommend this Anime for people who enjoy American cartoons as well as anime (which is probably why I liked this so much). Overall, it's a very refreshing anime to watch as I found it fun to be invested in the main character's hard efforts and his determination. If you are unsure, watch episode one and see whether or not you like the main character: If you found him cute/appealing then keep watching, otherwise if you hate the 'weak boy suddenly gets powers' anime trope that he has, you'd probably best watching something else.

                I want to start by saying two things: there is absolutely nothing original about this anime and yet I powered through 7 episodes in one sitting. It has all the right things to be a well rounded show that anyone can enjoy and over all its great to watch. I gave the story a 6 because its pretty much your typical ""main character struggles to obtain his dreams and ends up surpassing all expectations"". However I will say the main character is still struggling and admits all his own weaknesses and the need for team work so it makes him very endearing.
The things that really
                  sold me on this anime were the characters and voice cast. There's a character for everyone to adore and the relationship of the main character to his rival is fangirl quality. (i don't want to say you should pick up this series if you miss naruto buuuuuut.....) Also I felt like the show has done a good job of slowly introducing us to all the characters in a memorable way which a lot of series struggle with when you have a classroom type setting with a lot of people to know.
I would also like to add that the artwork is pretty cool. Its some sort of perfect middle ground between american comics (which the show is inspired by) and typical japanese animation. The storytelling and character designs also straddle the lines between the two which makes for a pretty cool dynamic. There's also great humor all over the place and even though the situations are always fairly series there's a light hearted fun approach to the whole thing. Being some one that tends to watch a lot of dark, morbid anime (ie: tokyo ghoul, AoT, darker than black) and also does not like comedy/romance/slice-of-life; i found this series to be a good break away from my usual types of shows without falling into the easy pitfall of anime ridiculousness. 
Overall I think this is a series anyone could enjoy and is definitely worth a watch. I would probably recommend it to people that like things like assassination classroom, fairytail, (*cough*naruto*cough), and maybe even something like yu yu hakusho though not as focused on the fighting so far. It has already been announced that there will be a second season and I'm definitely looking forward to it.",8,firemercury

                Spoiler-free Review
In my personal opinion, if Boku no Hero Academia is an indication of the direction that shonen or anime in general is headed, the now booming industry will quickly fade into obscurity again. Why would I make such a claim? Before I get into that, I'll discuss some of the pros of this show. For one thing, the art and animation are distinct and unique. It's not a particularly appealing style, missing some of the clear love that permeated the designs of past popular shonen such as Dragon Ball and Naruto, but it is unique nonetheless. That's all I've got actually. Apart from that,
                  I believe the show is riddled with flaws. The story is extremely boring, ranging from absolutely nothing going on to the most generic and basic of shonen arcs. We do not live in a time where it is acceptable to simply expound on the past themes of shonen; those themes had their time and we must pay respect to them by evolving. In all fairness, the show does try setting itself apart from classics like Dragon Ball in a few ways. For example, it attempts to make each character you meet as unappealing and unlikable as possible. Both the protagonists and antagonists entirely lacked my sympathy as I waded through this series, trying to understand its popularity. The main protagonist in particular is intensely terrible and boring, which sucks since he is 90% of the show's focus. Other than Froppy, the BNHA characters can all eat shit, especially Minato, who is a perverted baby that receives far too much screen time. I really didn't enjoy this show; if you're looking to get into anime, there are much better places to start, and I feel ashamed that this series acts as one of its most important modern representatives.",5,painlaser

                This is the most overrated shit I have ever seen.
Story: The story Is about a world where 80% of humanity get some super powers and the other 20% don’t. And here comes the young boy who belongs to this 20% of humanity which hasn't got any powers. Then the protagonist meet a hero who want’s to give him his powers because he is injured or something and he can only use his powers for a few hours a day
So here is the point when it starts to be boring and retarded.
The superhero gave him his power but he can't use them because he is weak
                  cunt so he
starts to train his body so he can someday use those powers.
He gets into the best school  where they learn how  to use those powers and how to be a
hero or something like that.
For the rest episodes are some fights that are boring as fuck and generally this starts to be horrible to watch.
The story Is just retarded and not enjoyable.
Art: Art isn’t bad but I personally didn’t like it however this was the best thing in the series.
Sound: Don’t remember any of it so it must suck.
Character: Characters are retarded and unlikable
Enjoyment: This is not enjoyable at all.
Overall: Just please don’t watch this shit… I rather watch SAO 10 times a month for the rest of my life than watching this shit. And I’m not even kidding.

                Boku no Hero Academia is fine. Just fine. If you don't mind a severe lack of character development and not caring about anyone at all really, then you'll like this anime. If not, well, don't blame the studio because they animated it just like the source material. It's just really disappointing to see something so average. Like, they don't give me a reason to care about the characters at all, so why would I care when they get hurt? The action is fine, I guess, but it's hard to get into when you don't give a flying horse-feather about anyone that's fighting.
On the bright side,
                  the animation and sound is nice. Silver linings.

If you want a superhero anime that is different that's also set in school....and haven't heard of MY HERO ACADEMIA, you've been living under a rock, it has a great story....entertaining arcs and an ultimate goal that can keep the show running for seasons.
One of the things going for MHA is the great animation that amplifies the action so the extent of maybe even competing with ONE PUNCH Man! All the characters from 1-a have their own personalities that you can admire, despise or want....maybe.
Some of the good characters of this series is Bakugo, he seems like an airhead at first but he's actually my favourite character and one of the most interesting ones, also Deku's also pretty cool, He is definitely a hero everyone in the class can look up to as well as the audience,

                In my honest opinion I think My Hero Academia is the most 6.5/10 anime. It's fine it doesn't do anything particularly great, but I don't think it does anything bad.
Starting off with the story I think like a lot of people from the beginning it has potential to be very good, but it just misses the mark. At first when you think about it you're like cool a superhero show with an entire school of heroes that sounds great. The main character doesn't have any powers? Oh okay he gets powers, good otherwise that would have been really bad. Like its great on paper, but
                  it's just not translated well.
The art is a 6. Again nothing special. The fight scenes are meh but not terrible. Overall just meh.
The sound is maybe the best part after the story. The season 1 opening is catchy and one i'd listen to but after that the other OP's just kinda suck :/
The characters are the biggest problem for me. They just all seem so generic, I mean have you seen All Might? Also Deku? Really?? You couldn't have made a more disinteresting protagonist. Yeah he's kind, but that's his only thing. He literally is just so unfunny. He's just so average that's the only way I can describe him. I think I'm being very generous with a 5 because I slightly like Bakugo and the clone teacher is pretty solid. 
Enjoyment was a 6. I almost quit after the first two episodes because it was just so bad, but it picks up from there. Heroes are meh, villains are meh, just a very plain show that isn't anything other than fine.
Overall I would give it a 6.5/10 but since I can't do half points I would rather round down for this anime. This is how I'd rate all 4 seasons as well they're all about the same. The tournament arc in season 2 I'd say is the peak, but even then i'd only give it a 7. There's always hope, I'll watch season 5 to see how it goes and if I like it maybe these scores will change, but for now it is very average.",6,Copdog13

                Are you wondering why ""My Hero Academy"" was one of the most admirable anime in 2016 or what does it have to offer that considerable number of people have given a high rating for it? If your curious, please keep reading...
The story starts off simple: A  regular middle school kid, Midoriya Izuku, doesn't have superpowers (or you can call them 'Quirks') unlike other people who do and since he dreams of going to a hero academy and becoming a hero, he is unable to do so since he is 'Quirkless' (without superpowers). 
Anyway, the story starts in the usual way like most shounen anime
                  do, and it carries on like that throughout the anime and so this simply means that the anime doesn't have any unique concepts to offer; the same old quirky characters and the same concept of good versus evil. Then what does this anime offer to its audience? It the familiarity that keeps us watching...
We've seen great shows like One punch Man, Hunter X Hunter and so on. We loved the drama and the characters that these anime put up. We  alos sometimes admire anime that are similar to the ones we greatly appreciate and hence, this is why we adore 'My Hero Academy'. I've seen a countless anime that have tried to be original and unique but failed when it came to enjoyment. This could be because they were so focused on making everything, including plot twists and characters, unique that it just made the whole anime appear flat and 2-dimensional. However, this anime did not get into that and that's what unique about it. It didn't force itself to be different and that's why they were able to execute the story plot and characters well. The soundtracks are also worth noting as it made the action look fantastic.
The last few episodes had a great soundtrack played while jaw-dropping fights were shown. ""You say run"" is an OST that's probably the most notable OSTs I have ever heard and there are tons of youtube videos that use the OST for other anime just to prove that the catchy music goes with everything.
It's immensely pleasing with a roaring entertainment, nevertheless, the anime has its drawbacks. Firstly, it was quite noticeable that the anime was too fast-paced in the first few episodes that it felt meaningless. It shows that our protagonist, Izuku, trains awfully hard for ten months but for us, all that training happens in less than one episode. The training was supposed to be shown as an inspirational and encouraging move but they quickly rushed through it. I know that the directors were trying to fit the whole story in 13 eps but it shouldn't have been rushed so badly. 
There was another matter that made we feel like dropping it in the beginning - the first few episodes were a bit boring and i guess the reason for that was that it had a horrible scene sequencing or maybe the pacing kept differing that gave it funny feeling and made it almost intolerable to watch.
The first four to five episodes were slightly boring to me so I recommend you not to judge it in those first few episodes. If you love shounen, you will most likely appreciate the anime as it is very entertaining.",9,redyred323

                Boku no Hero Academia is a good choice for you if youd enjoy a series that tackles heroism and the traits a person should have in order to be an admirable hero. However it's a bad choice if you're tired a lot of the generic aspects of anime that are set in a school setting with a team of kids that train to become heroes and save the world for onesidedly evil characters. It's also a bad choice if you're tired of the bland shy bullied but selfless main character, who behaves like most average shounen protagonists, who start off as weak or incompetent, and
                  steadily but surely grow strong as the series moves forward.
The story is something that was done a lot, or rather, the ""kid wants to become the best at x but he's not good at it"" aspect. Deku wants to become a superhero in a society where 80% of people have superpowers and he doesn't have any. But the manner through which the story executes its narrative and the character arcs of Deku are just well written, and despite using everything that is to be expected in this type of story, it's done in a way that presents most aspects in a really strong way. 
For instance, Deku is indeed the ""IF I TRY HARD ENOUGH, I CAN DO IT!"" character, he's got that attitude. However, the story starts from the point where Deku almost gives up on that view of himself, portraying a chain of events where he has to wake up to reailty. But even when he accepts it, he finds that when someone was in danger, he couldn't just sit around and he had to try to do something to help. And he doesn't generically get powers out of nowhere in this scenario, like some might expect. He is seen as a hindrance and pretty much suicidal for doing something like this. But this whole scenario and everything that led up to it show what type of person he is. He is someone who couldn't become what he aspired because he simply was unlucky, that dreamt of it all along, and was shown the reality of it. And then this course of action leads us as to why he wanted to become what he became. It's because he wanted to make a difference, to help the people who needed help in those dire moments, as he admired people capable of doing so. And as a last attempt at denial, at denying the reality he's in, he tried to do what the people he admired thought they'd do, and tried to help and put himself in harm's way. From a psychological perspective, not a selfless act, but from a bystander's, it is definitely one.
What I'm saying by describing the character arc Deku went through is that the series has good character portrayal, and knows how to flesh out its characters. I could explain why the character arc of Deku is even better written than I've already given it credit for, but I'd rather not give away more things about the series than I did unless essential to my point. Anyway, after this short character arc, we fully understand Deku's goal and ambitions, because he was strongly portrayed.
However, while the series does have strong character portrayal, I can say that in this season at least, it had strong character portrayal for only 3 characters, those being the main character and two other characters strongly tied to his development. One character is the mentor (of course the shounen protagonist needed a mentor) who is a genuinely good rolemodel, who despite all odds, people have taken a liking to because of how good he was at his job, but he secretly was injured and he is now struggling to keep up everyone else's expectation. He acts out as a symbol of peace and his mere existence keeps people from going nuts and causing chaos around the world. And the other character is his rival (of course the shounen protagonist has a rival) who is a character that is the complete opposite of the protagonist. He's an angsty teen with a superiority complex that wants to become a hero to prove he is the best and that he can always win, who bullies the protagonist because he feels like he challenges his superiority. What Iparticularily enjoy of him is how threatened he feels just by Deku's existence, to the point where I'd even say it even seems like he's almost scared of Deku. What's interesting about this is that the person who's got the most inflated ego, to the point he thinks the world revolves around him, is scared of the person he sees as the lowest of the low, to the point where he can't help but react impulsively whenever Deku doesn't fit the narrative he has had given him. These three portrayals are strong and do wonders for the story.
However every other character is just... there, and otherwise, Deku is a generic shounen protagonist. He's a kid who wants to be the best, who's incredibly determined to do so, is an underdog, he's shy around girls because they're girls and other such tropes would also fit him well. The villains are the worst part since they were portrayed as... I wouldn't say cartoonish evil, but as people who simply do petty crimes or just want chaos because HAHAHA, EVERYONE IS A BUNCH OF SISSIES AND SINCE WE HAVE POWERS WE SHOULD ABUSE THEM! Other students don't really have anything yet given to them except everything they need at the surface level to work as characters, some powers and some personality traits. There's plenty of time to flesh them out, but how one dimensional the villains felt, and how much worse they made the last arc kinda worries me.
You see, while I think for the most part Boku no Hero Academia had a good story, I think the final arc of this season was what most people are genuinely worried with about this show. I won't give any details that are specific to give anything away, but the last arc merely repeated some of the same points the series has already expressed and featured some onedimensional villains. And the whole arc's point was just to say ""this job is dangerous and now the kids know it. there is evil in this world."" But the ""evil"" is almost saturday morning cartoon-ish in motivation and the only way the job would prove dangerous is there would be permanent consequences to the character's health or existence, such as death, loss of power or a crippling injury. Which I can't say whether or not happens, because not even I know for sure since it's not a point of focus, it's only a possibility. The arc didn't really try to even capitalize on its own message, it merely just wanted to bring all the characters from one point to the next with as minimal consequences as possible.
At best, I think it was an excuse to have a lot of action, since it had a lot of people in a lot of fights in a secluded area, except there's a lot of jobbers involved with a lot of people with superpowers just eating ass and easily losing, making them feel incompetent and making the confrontations onesided. Which is a somewhat worrysome area in Boku no Hero Academia, since the power gap kinda makes this a constant possibility, where D-Listing could constantly happen and fights feeling onesided. Which doesn't always happen in the series, it does have some good action bits that are entertaining and hype to see, with the best being a 2 on 2 exercise where the characters have to capture a location from the opposing team, where it featured some strategical thinking and tactics. But there's a lot of the bits that feel onesided, where, I get it, some of it has to be there, but you can tell me around 100-200 people with superpowers are just gonna be cannon foddering jobbers in an organized attack.
In terms of comedy, Boku no Hero Academia, didn't really humor me because I don't see a lot of comedy in it. I see the attempts of making some characters perverted or shy around women because they're attractive but really... that's comedy? While the world is nonsensical, I found a lot of the things that are supposed to be aiming this to be considered a comedy to just be tools to make the series lighthearted due to how serious it takes portraying its theme. In all honesty, I don't think there's anything really comedic about this show. I find it to be a really serious show, that tries to be as lighthearted as possible, this sometimes being in conflict with its themes. And I wouldn't call a show a comedy just because it's lighthearted. I'm just addressing this since MAL tagged it as such.
While I may have complained about the show's action in terms due to the power gap, the animation is smooth and everything looks good. The artstyle is fairly simplistic and colorful, but nonetheless looks vibrant, fitting the show's aimed energetic nature to pull in the right atmosphere. The soundtrack of the show is mostly atmospheric, with mostly orchestral music and some electronic music influences. It sounds good for the most part, but it isn't exactly my cup of tea, but it serves its purpose.
That's pretty much what Boku no Hero Academia is. A shounen about heroism. It doesn't really try to distance itself from the same archetypes a shounen has, and that might turn off some people, but it does a genuinely good job in what it portrays. If you're not interested in shounens and detest their tropes, steer clear of this anime. However if you do enjoy them, Boku no Hero Academia is a good shounen. I'd say its execution is definitely good for its target audience, and it's definitely above the average shounen, but it still has the shortcomings that come with it, and not a lot of things to differentiate it from the others, despite its overall strong writing. I enjoyed watching it, because I typically enjoy action shows that stick to their point, and Boku no Hero Academia did do that. I think people who enjoy shounens and well executed themes can enjoy this show, but if the flaws presented are a particular hurdle to you, they are definitely gonna be a detriment to your watching experience.",6,ItIsIDio

Short and Sweet
Story 8:  people are ""born with quirks"" that later in their life, either become superheroes/villains. UA high is a school for only the best of the best, which Izuku enrolled in. 
Art 7:  The art wasn't anything amazing, some of the scenes were so out odd.  One example is when All Might was fighting against Noumu, there was one point where they just turned into blobs.  
Sound 9:  The opening music was great and the tracks during the anime was a nice choice feel like all the tracks they picked were great choices.  
Character 8:
                  The character were good, some of the characters had dumb quirks.  I guess they added that for the comedy sake of the show.  My favotire character has to be All Might for sure, I just love his story and why he fights.  Always gives it his all. 
Enjoyment 9: I love this show and enjoyed every episode, not once was I bored.  I just wished it was 24 episodes long.  [But then again that's why they gave it a season 2] 
Overall 8.2: I feel like this anime will be a big one, I can see this anime going on for hundreds of episodes.  I will for sure follow this anime till the end

                SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED
Although this anime seemed to be hyped quite a bit, I did not expect this hype to last. However, after finishing the anime, I can say that this is by far one of the best shounen anime I've watched. 
Character Development: (10/10)
The main character shows improvement like the typical shounen character, but this is never illogical. The power-ups make sense and the anime takes it's time to slowly improve their abilities. While other anime may have the ""Power of feelings"" or the ""Power of determination"" to somehow change the outcome of the battle (I'm not saying I hate these anime; I'm just saying
                  that this anime seemed unique and different), this anime shows less of that and more smart tactics and actual thinking. Also the main character's power seemed very ""traditional"" and ""simple"" and I was slightly unsatisfied, but this actually seemed like the right choice for the anime. The main character is very strong, but he has his weaknesses which makes him not completely OP (I'm assuming this ""weakness"" is going to disappear with time, effort, and experience and I think this will make the battles much more exciting and creative). We can also see that Midoriya is not emotionless and fearless. He is relatable, simply because he is emotional and afraid, but also strong and independent when he needs to be. 
The other characters also have their moments. This anime slightly reminds me of Log Horizon because of the fact that, although Midoriya is the main character, there are others who are just as important as him. They also have very good character development and work well with the story. The fact that this anime took an entire episode to help Midoriya and his rival, Bakugou, to understand each other was something I very much enjoyed. 
Art/Sound: (9/10)
I'm not a very judgmental person especially when it comes to art or sound. The only thing I'd like to say is, its very enjoyable to watch and the art and sound help improve that feeling. 
In my opinion, it is very nice artwork and sound. (especially considering ""Bones"")
Story: (9/10)
The overall setting is simply a normal world with people who gained special abilities (ie: Quirks). The story is based upon Midoriya trying to become a hero without actually having a quirk. The fact that it is not based on someone who's already powerful definitely improved my score. 
At first, I was simply watching the main character grow and gain control of his abilities and it did seem like it lacked any real plot. I was wondering halfway through the series, ""Is there supposed to be an enemy any time soon or is season 1 just going to be Midoriya improving himself and his relationships with other people?"" (I personally still enjoyed the earlier episodes a lot and I'm not saying any of the episodes were bad) However, near the end of the series, we get a very important villain which created a lot of battles and action that many were waiting for (It was very flashy and I like that).
Overall: (10/10)
I was very content with many of the things in this anime. There was comedy, there was action, and there were many important and emotional scenes. What more could you ask?
In the beginning, we see the slow and realistic improvement of the characters and in the end, we get amazing action with villains that'll eventually create a bigger plot for the next season. 
Overall, I went in with no expectations and was quite surprised how it all turned out. The beginning did seem somewhat slow and the main character did seem somewhat weak, but the anime tied everything together very well in the end. 
It is unique and is not like your typical fast-paced shounen anime. This is the exact reason why I enjoyed this anime. It was different, yet still similar enough that it gave us, the viewers, what we wanted and had the necessary ""hooks"" to every episode ending. I was always satisfied with the episode: It wasn't too short, it wasn't too long, and it was never boring. 
PS:
I actually had a friend who didn't like it because the main character was weak and a crybaby, but I personally did not see it that way. Not all main characters should be fearless, dumb, and victorious. They should have character development and learn though their mistakes. They should try their best and see results that correlate to the effort they put in (Kind of like Shokugeki no Soma :D).
Some of my friends said the story was also very typical and ordinary with nothing different from other shounen anime. I also see that this anime can be very simplistic by simply getting stronger and beating villains. However, this goes much deeper than that (especially psychologically). Story and setting is one thing, but every other aspect put together is what makes the anime great. You can have a stereotypical story in a great anime and a unique story in a bad anime. 
The final verdict is: Everyone has their own opinion, but mine is that this anime is amazing and I give it a 10/10.",10,Yooniplop

Story: 
My Hero Academia's story is beautiful and inspires me daily. It's also the only shounen anime I've seen where injuries actually matter and every character has their own weakness whether it's physical or emotional.

Beautiful! Most of the tracks make me cry like crazy!
Characters: 
The characters are wonderful! All of them are very unique and awesome! (My favorite is between Bakugou and Todoroki).

Boku no hero academy:
A classical story of zero to hero. 
Deku a young boy is about to hit his entrance exams. He wants to like most kids in his class become a superhero. Superhero has now officialy become a proffesion after the fact that 80% of humanity got quirks (superpowers). 
Here is the catch however Deku is part of the 20% that does not have a quirk.
Now for someone who does not have a quirk it is essentially impossible to become a hero. But Deku wants to really bad.
So far so good. We got a nice story building. And by this point
                  I could see infront of me a technological cyber warrior that would use wits and knowledge over raw strenght. Boy was I wrong.
This is when in my opinion the story dropped from a 9 to a 7. Because it is at this point he meets his idol All might. And to his supprise learn that All might was born without a quirk aswell but instead had his passed down to him. Guess what Deku is now next in line and gets All mights powers.
After this it becomes a classic Naruto story where Deku wants to prove his worth while competing with Sasuke in this case Kachan as he is called. 
A perfect zero to hero Anime but nothing Ground breaking really.

                Boku No Hero Academia is one series that my opinion on changes every so often. As someone who was just getting into watching anime, I took it as one of the best things I’ve ever seen with it’s incredible visuals and a story I personally found to be original. As time went on, I came to realise that this show is very generic. I never found it to be that bad though, so if I could summarise this in 2 words, it would have to be “Dumb Fun.” For beginners, it’s a nice thing to start with. For people more invested in the community, it
                  might seem rather generic. Overall, a fun experience but not anything too special.",6,Tropical-lMob

                My hero academia 
Everytime I watch a new episode of this anime im left grinning, laughing, crying, in excitement, awe, etc.
The stunning visuals, characters, and voice acting, all coincide with the amazing plot and story to develop an incredible anime that I enjoy every episode of. 
This anime gives you the best it has to offer with every episode and even if the last episode was perfect the next one just comes up at you, punches you in the face, and exceeds your already great expectations.
Oh how I love this anime, my hero academia is at the very top of shounen animes standing up there
                  with shounen such as Hunter x Hunter and Naruto. A truly fascinating anime.
Now to get into the actual story.
My hero academia is an anime about a little boy named Izuku Midoriya who lives in a world where 80% of the population has super powers yet he is sadly one of the few born without these super powers called Quirks. Now in this world some have Quirks that are far more useful and/or powerful than others so bad people started to use them for their own personal gain, crime, fun, etc. The world couldn't handle it so citizens took it up to themselves these citizens developed into the current worlds ""Pro-Heroes"" and the top of all the pro heroes the #1 Hero is All Might the most powerful Hero of all time and young Midoriya's idol. This young scrappy little boy wants to be a hero just like all might but....sadly he isn't strong at all, no matter how big his heart is his body is weak, or atleast it was until he has a fateful encounter with his idol All Might. This encounter changes his life forever as this young boy finally gets the hope he once had overflowing inside him returned and the affirmation he never got from anyone that he too can become a great hero.
Follow this young boy in his journey from the lowest of the low, a useless little kid to the most powerful Hero of all time.",9,AnimeDefector
31964,"
                Boku no hero academia is normally bashed on for having a poor story and childish characters with childish dreams, however as a shounen I think it's at the top of it's game.
Story 6/10
The story just follows a basic shounen guideline, so it clearly wasn't going to be too groundbreaking, however, be it becoming king of the pirates, becoming a great exorcist or becoming the world's greatest hero, we can all agree that they bring decent stories with them, no matter how repetitive.
Art 10/10
Hero aca has some of the most stunning animation for a shounen anime ever, from the emotional scenes to the energetic battles the
                  animation never fails to go plus ultra. Furthermore, the scenery and characters themselves are very skillfully designed and brought to life.
Sound 10/10
I have all OPs and some ENs dowloaded on my phone so the 10/10 is a no brainer for me, furthermore the music is matched to the animation on all of these giving an even greater sensation when listening to them over and over again. Also the OSTs are great, kicking in at the perfect time during fights for an insta orgasm, no wonder they have millions of views on yt.
Character 8/10
So to be honest Deku is pretty bland, following the shounen to-do-list, however the rest of the cast all have powerfull back stories, different ambitions and unique personalities, making them super interesting friends and foes, shame on Deku though, they could have done a lot more with a main character.
Enjoyment 10/10
I join millions of over fans in saying that hero aca is one of my favourite animes of all times, and defenetely a must watch for anyone coming to the genre, easily an anime where you can watch all 3 seasons in a couple days.",9,Manlikecheese
31964,"
                I love this anime! That being said this is my least favorite season of Boku no Hero Academia.
This show is great because it is very character focused which creates more emotional attachment and desire to see growth in each of the characters, rather then a plot driven show where you are mainly in it for the concept and closure in the plot.  It makes me dread that the story has to end someday for the love of the characters.
MHA makes me feel like a kid again, I liken it to watching the original Superman cartoons- I know he can't be beat but he became
                  a symbol of hope, passion, and goodness for me.  I've grown to see allmight and many of the heroes the same way, I just want to see them beat up the bad guys.
The drawbacks of the first season is that first that Izuku is utterly useless and annoying and usually the episodes lead up to a point where he has an epiphany and saves the day which makes for a weak story.  Second the animation for the fight sequences are usually boring visually, but the fact that you know the characters so well makes it worth it.  The third and biggest negative aspect is that it feels like half of every episode is a flashback to a scene we just saw one or two episodes ago which made it hard to enjoy at points.
Mr. Aizawa is my favorite character because of his quirkiness, serious nature, and pure intention despite being seen as scary by some of the other characters.",6,Frassati
31964,"
                My Hero Academia is an inspiring story about achieving your dreams. It makes me feel invested in the characters and their stories. I cried, I laughed and overall enjoyed this series.
I gave this series a 10 for a reason, even if not everyone agrees with me.
Here is what I thought on each aspect of the show if you are interested.
Story: 8
In a world where you don't fit in, and fate is against your dreams is tough. Especially when everyone reminds you everywhere you go. As generic as this is, I felt they delivered it right. Over the span of 2 episodes, we see our MC
                  Midoriya go from Zero to Hero. We see characters like Bakugou that are born powerful and we see characters like Midoriya that aren't. It helps us see the difference and how reality can suck. He's not gifted, he doesn't 'magically' get his quirk, he works for it. This sends off a good message and makes me motivated to do things.
If you have seen shows like 'Black Clover' or 'Naruto', you may say that they are similar in some aspects. If this was a review for those shows, I would rate the same.
The whole hero idea and everyone having power really appeals to me than just one kid being 'special' and 'one-of-a-kind' with his power among a normal society.
Art: 10
Can I just start with how much I LOVE this artstyle? Everything looks attractive and appealing to the eye. Especially the characters hero costumes. The facial expressions are very accurate to their personalities AND, the fight scenes are animated fantastically! This one may not appeal to everyone the way it does for me, but I love how everything is designed and drawn by being so smooth.
Sound:10
You Say Run. A track played multiple times through the first episode. It is played differently though at different parts to either sound sad or bold. The way the track is played when his mother tells him that he can't be a hero and when Midoriya attempted to saved Bakugou and when All Might told Midoriya he can be a hero really struck me. The same song made me feel different emotions at different times proving that 'You Say Run goes with everything' (Don't quote me on that.)
Various other tracks really set the mood making the intensity higher, or the moment more depressing. MHA's OST is really a work of art that is highly under appreciated.
Character: 9
I feel invested in each and every character’s story. If it’s a Pro Hero, a Student or a Villain, they all have a story to tell. Each character has a unique personality making them stand out for different reasons and I like that. Of course some characters are not very likeable while others would be considered “cliche”, but that shouldn’t turn you away. Each quirk also makes each character special and I like that.
Enjoyment: 9
From the fight scenes to when we see Midoriya progress as a hero, I feel invested in the story and what's going on. I leave wondering what will happen next and what the result will be. I feel excitement bubble in my stomach and I feel empathy from the bottom of my heart at almost every scene that is made to make you feel. Of course some parts are a little slow, but the parts that get me going outshine those by a landslide!
Overall: 10
My Hero Academia is a story that made me invest majority of my thoughts into it in a positive way. I believe that anyone can enjoy this show if they keep an open mind to it. I assure you that if you like superheroes, mystery, action, you will most certainly walk away with at least some kind of happiness after completing this show and it will drag you back in for more in Season 2.",10,Todoroqueen

                I rewatched this anime because S2 is out and decided to write my review on it.
The story is ok,not many action involved but its focused on MC's story about a kid who don't have superpowers unlike most of population but once he show the determination and courage to risk his life to help rescue his classmate he manage to impress most famous super hero known he gets a chance to gain super strenght and  with the help of his new friends and now his mentor he is learning to control his new power and also develop as a person.It was interesting anime,lacking in fighting
                  scenes but that was probably the plan to get to know MC and now in 2nd season i hope we will see more action
The Art is really great and i have no complaints with it,really well made 
I give it overall 7 but its kinda unique anime(we seen other anime with super powers but this is kinda original story more or less) so it takes a while to get used to it so that maybe affected my overall rating but still it got 7 from me so its worth watching in my opinion",7,ShadowYamihiro

                Exclusively for Season 1:
My Hero Academia has similar traits with big shounen anime, especially One Piece. It's no doubt that it is and it will be part of the modern shounen on the top.
It very much feels like One Piece with how it emits 'adventure,' but instead of the wide world building of One Piece, BNHA provides for creative abilities and flashy fight scenes. I like how our main character begins from the bottom with no actual powers other than his quality as a person. 
The story is well-paced, this season clearly is an introductory season for the series, yet it still managed to show
                  us good action scenes the fit well in the story. I love how Deku actually compensates for his lack of mastery in his quirk. His strategies are compelling, and the way he wins fights are logical and sound.
In terms of character, I can't say much on most of the characters yet, except that Bakugo is an unreasonable jerk with no compelling motivation as to why he bullies Deku other than the need to feel superior. I also hate how Deku manages to revere him. Bakugo was never nice to him, so why is Deku so attached to him? I could not think of anything other than for Deku's character development and for some drama that Bakugo is actually the one who is envious of Deku. All I can say is Deku and Bakugo's relationship is bad and forced. Also, a nitpick, I hate that we have a character like Mineta who is a pervert for 'comedy.' When will this trope in shounen anime end? It's not funny, it's out of place, and furthers sexual harassment.
The animation of the fight scenes are okay, the soundtracks are average. Overall, this season kept me interested for more.",6,rotanrotan1

                The appearance of ""quirks,"" newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.
Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique
                  ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!
Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.

                I didn't like My Hero Academia at all. It's just the same shonen but 20 years late. The story isn't interesting at all and it's kinda foregone that it goes in that way. The characters aren't interesting as the people say, and their quirks are just not cool. The thing that i hated most about this show is the fact that nothing happens in 2 seasons, and the villains are just, villains because they're...villains? That's a stupid thing. All Might isn't a very good character, because it's just the same character as other 20 shows, and it's too much a ""seen before"" thing, like Midoriya

8/10 STORY: The story in my hero is great! It’s something unique. There were points in the story that were super exciting but also sad. Izuku that is quirkless and have such much love to all might is beautiful and sad at the same time... great story overall! 
9/10 ART: The art and animation is amazing! The art is super nice! Sometimes I watch Izuku’s hair just because it just looks really nice ⚆ _ ⚆. The animation is sick too! The fighting scenes are amazing! Parts of episodes are really smooth!

10/10 SOUND: Oh boy! The music in this is a masterpiece! The opening song super is nice and gets never old. Thats the same for the ending song. But the music during the episodes is so good! Everytime all might enters the music goes super epic! I get chills when listening! 
9/10 CHARACTER: Of course the characters are all unique. Class 1-A have so many different personalities. Izuku that is the main protagonist is someone were you can see yourself into and all might who is just the big hero but has also his funny side. It's just great to see all of these different characters! 
8/10 ENJOYMENT: I've had so much fun watching this season of my hero! The only thing that I am a bit negative about is the fact that the show is kinda slow pacing. But that doesn't make this anime a bad show. I love watching my hero and can't wait to watch the second season!

You have colorful characters all fighting to be the best to complete some super dangerous mission and then finally be accepted only to fight an evil organisation. Also the main character develops some OP powers while at first he was a complete noob.
Now those were some pretty harsh parallels but to me it seems just fine since it doesn't really copy Naruto, it just uses the same premise and does it pretty well since this is a universe filled with superheroes.
The animation is one of my favorites, it
                  just pops out, like actual comic books were brought to life and even though the characters aren't that developed, they still brimm with life and color.
The plot advances nicely and I never felt getting bored, there's just always something new happening and I'm really waiting for the second season to come.
If you're interested then you can watch a more indepth review I made on this anime on my Youtube channel MudanTV. I've spent like over 10 hours composing my thoughts, recording and editing the most awesomest review you'll ever see. If that's not true then feel free to dislike it.",8,MudanTV

                In the Legend Of Zelda universe, there exists a item called the Deku Nut, a small nuciform item that blinds all enemies when thrown at the ground. Similarly, Deku from Boku No Hero Academia is small, yet packs a shockingly strong punch. This anime is nuts.
The premise of this show is that in a world where the vast majority of all humans have some kind of superpower of varying strength and degree. They can range from mundane bonuses to everyday life, such as being able to attract small objects, to the ability to change the weather with a single punch, which we have totally never
                  seen before. The way that a person's Quirk is decided is from the quirks of their respective parents; a fire-breather hitting the shack with someone who can turn enlarge their hands would make someone who can make their hands burn or something. Our main character, Midoriya Izuku, who we will refer to as 'Deku' because it's shorter, is one of the few humans who are completely, terribly, normal. 
Unlike the Zelda franchise, let's start with some negative points. The impracticality of some powers among Deku's classmates, such as one girl which can turn invisible (when she was a baby how could parents find her? How is she not the most obviously overpowered person in the show) and another character of minor importance; someone who wears a spacesuit when not in space known as 13-go. He can make black holes, but apparently, the gravity has grown stronger over time seeing as black holes now function like defective vacuum cleaners. All Might should in no way be considered to be the strongest hero; being invisible is the simplest way to stick a knife in someone from behind. Also, I distinctly remember one person who was literally a warp gate. Being able to teleport only half of a person, effectively cutting the target in half, why didn’t he kill all the students, instead choosing to scatter them all over the map/play structure/training field? Also, a fundamental problem with this anime’s world; if two parents with weak quirks yield one quirkless child and the majority of the quirk users have weak quirks, doesn’t that mean that the quirkless demographic should be a lot larger than 20%? In fact, they should be dying in droves every generation. But then again, the point of this anime isn’t exactly worldbuilding but they still do a good job anyway.
I know it’s going to sound cheesy, but I felt like this was genuinely moved me. In a genre revolving around teenage boys yelling while screaming the name of their attacks and minute-long scenes with the same frame, Boku no Hero Academia does...well, the same thing, but better. The first two episodes are set up around Deku’s hopeless dream of becoming a hero despite being completely average. In the first few episodes we get most of the character development, which I especially liked. Deku gets attacked, gets saved by his hero and idol All Might, only to realize his manmade god, his marble pillar was actually cracked on the inside. All Might is only able to maintain his superhero form for a limited time, turning into a seedy looking American the rest of the day. Deku witnesses firsthand All Might’s internal conflict, and how the smile on his face was just as much for himself as for everyone looking All Might’s existence serves to reinforce the idea that ‘even the most perfect people are still human’. The arbitrary time limit is a metaphor for impermanence and evanescence of human power and established legends; the backbone of his power is, after all, something to be inherited. Deku himself is no stranger either to crushing reality, going through depression at the age of six.  , seeing this, shows the audience his dedication in a beautiful scene with the sunset in slow motion and All Might’s retreating figure. He went through more of a development arc in two episodes than most shounen protagonists go through in two hundred. All of this painted a picture which imprints on the viewer’s mind a sense of childish nostalgia versus grim reality, which was a powerful image even though the premise for all this was All Might apparently deflating during surgery (?).
After the highly above-average initial episodes, the story kind of devolves into a normal shounen . The fights were epic though. eh. Take a 9.
If only on a basis of the first few episodes, Boku No Hero Academia connects with the audience in a personal trip exploring a child’s journey of adoration and disappointment, one every human regardless of race, creed, or quirk has suffered. 
My Hero Academia is not called The Hero Academia, or Deku’s Hero Academia, because in it we get a sense of personality that one can only call their own.",9,yuekikaze_

                This is perhaps the most conventional of the new unconventional shonen  series; future installments may well change the score for this young series, but not what it is. On one hand the contrived plots, runaway power up and awkward comedy of other shonen titles is absent. So the journey from zero to hero, the great shonen story, is real and deadly serious as Naruto's never was. The real anguish of power level 0, the competition from a world of top-tier heroes, not a sole flamboyant rival, and the vomit-inducing, bone-shattering labour, renewed at every stage of the series, make this definitely the series biggest
                  strength. The aforementioned rival is a decent character, likewise the over-serious friend and love interest. The teacher-student relationship is perhaps stronger, thought not yet more poignant,  than Assassination Classroom. Not a single fight scene yet is boring; many are simply electrifying.
However, this series is still shonen. Hard work and courage are the powers to conquer the world; characters look set to develop more in their powers than their personalities. The villainous characters particularly can be pegged as lightweights straight away. Character motivations and the plot they determine exactly (a break with reality in itself) seem simplistic and already set in stone. Character relationships and animation, though certainly good, seem particularly conventional compared to Mob Psycho 100. The superhero satire isn't so good as One Punch Man (Mumen Rider beats MHA, even its the only thing he can 'beat' ahaha). Worldbuilding is sketchy, and, with everything else, streets behind Fullmetal Alchemist. But this is certainly worth following for fans of good shonen, and good adventure.",7,Ghostfriendly

                After being recommended this, I initially watched it without anything really holding me back or any preconceived notions. I like comics, grew up on superheroes, and was looking to watch more anime after seeing Violet Evergarden, Fullmetal Alchemist, etc.
First and foremost, I didn't find any major issues upon my first watch. I liked the story, most of the characters, and generally just liked the show. I'm no fanatic, but it seemed decent. Unfortunately, it fell apart on the first rewatch like a cheap shirt I put through the wash for the first time. 
Warning: this review is going to be long, but spoiler free. I
                  also focus more on characters, plot, writing, and episodes. There is a summary of my review below.
TL;DR: BNHA is a decent watch. The art, sound, and character designs are okay, nothing spectacular. It's good mindless watching, but probing deeper tends to make the story fall apart. 
Here are my main issues:
-THE CHARACTERS AND HOW THEY INTERACT
I actually have little issue with Deku, unlike some. He's an okay protagonist, but he has the unfortunate habit of making some ""inspiring"" speech like an eternity after someone has tried to beat him down. I'm not saying he has to just whip out some zingers, but it happens so often that it's not surprising to see this short, plain boy just make a grand speech for 3 minutes when all he needed to say was a sentence. Also, Bakugo has so much intensity for someone who is literally 15 years old. He also sounds like he's 20. I'm consistently thinking, ""Boy, shut up and drink a Capri Sun."" I'd find him hilarious if he just suddenly voice cracked while trying to intimidate Deku. Like this: ""Deku, I'm going to BEAT YoUuu."" I think that would greatly improve the comedy, which is lacking in parts.
Most of the other characters I don't mind. Uraraka and Deku are adorable together, and Tenya is a lovely character. I also love Momo, she's amazing, if poorly designed (why is the outfit so revealing? Why on earth was her character designed like that? She's 15, gross.) Some of the characters have the issue where they look way older than their canonical age (Tenya, Bakugo, whatever that kangaroo guy's name is, Momo, etc). There is one character I despise though, and that's MINETA.
While I understand that having a pervert is a trope in anime, it's kind of vile. Same for Midnight, who openly fawns over 15-year-olds in the Tournament, and definitely in a sexual way. Supposedly, Mineta is going to have a character arc, but I'm of the group where I think he's absolutely disgusting and should be punted off the Empire State Building. He's a literal toddler with no motivation for becoming a hero as I can see. In addition, a good chunk of the character interactions are purely fanservice, which is fine in moderate amounts, but it isn't here. I have nothing against sexual women, but as an older viewer, I don't want to see literal 15 year olds be sexualized.
-THE FILLER
While I don't mind intros and outros, the sheer amount of filler in episodes as the show progresses drives me bonkers. Each episode is around 22~ minutes. Taking out the intro and outro, which round up to  2 minutes each, that leaves us with 16. The first 3 minutes of the show is just a recap and basically yet another introduction to the show we didn't need because we're on episode 15 or whatever. Then, after the outro, there's like 3 more minutes of recap. In total, the amount of actual content is about 12 minutes. Out of a 22 minute episode. And I'm discounting the bumpers, which annoy me.
Anyways, back to the filler. It's irritating when I'm binging, especially since I KNOW WHAT THE PREMISE IS AND HAVE FOR A WHILE, ESPECIALLY AS I'M HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON. For as many episodes as there are, it just seems like a way to just skate through making episodes up to a certain time mark and number. It just confused and annoyed me and it just seems like no love was put into making the anime, just money in the hopes of making a profit.
-HOW IT TREATS CHARACTERS
Some characters get less screen time than warranted, and some more than they deserve (Mineta). The male characters tend to get a lot more focus than the female, unless they're Uraraka and have the benefit of being the love interest and Close Female Friend™.
For example, we have Ashido, who can create and throw acid. Pretty cool, right? Yeah, let's have her on the backburner. What about Tokoyami? He's actually one of my favorites, with a badass quirk, but outside of like 1 arc, he's essentially ignored when he's arguably one of the more compelling characters. Dark Shadow is fascinating as a Quirk but is ignored in favor of, say, Bakugo. Momo can create anything from her body (with limitations), but she's yet again put on the backburner. Hagakure is apparently the token invisible girl. She does have a Special Move, but her main quirk is that she's invisible. That's it. She can't make anything else invisible either. Ojiro (aka Kangaroo Kid) is another barely there character.
The thing is that BNHA initially framed itself as Deku's story. It was initially only about him, but as it opened up, it instead drove focus away from him, the ""protagonist"". The majority of the show is viewed through his eyes and events that happen to him and around him, but the rest is spent on other characters. It delves into the lives of the characters around him, but it doesn't mesh cohesively. It doesn't relate back to Deku, it relates back to some underplot that doesn't involve him. But it still says Deku is the sole protagonist when really, there are multiple, and more interesting characters are ignored.
-THE PROTAGONIST AND THE WORLD SET UP
To address another complaint about Deku, let's talk about how his character compares to others. As I said before, I'm okay with him as a character.
Deku always had pretty flimsy motivations. While I give him credit for his passion, his entire premise is that he's always wanted to be a hero, and now he gets the chance. But what it isn't discussed is WHY does he want to be a hero? WHAT has pushed him?
The world set up states that after the appearance of Quirks, heroes and villains emerged. Unlike in, say, the Marvel multiverse, being a hero is a legitimate profession, and heroes aren't necessarily better than villains. They just fall into certain categories, and their motivations vary. I have to give kudos to the show for challenging the idea of what makes a hero, even if it's surface level.
That being said, it's important to note how revered heroes are in the universe, and that many seek to emulate them. It's also important to note how a character like All Might is seen in the show, as a powerful force for good. Heroes are there to do battle with villains and protect civilians. It's a very basic, stripped down version of what superhero comics are about. My problem is that it doesn't build on this concept well.
BNHA is comparable to Victorious, strange as that is. Both shows have a ""normal"" protagonist who go to a special school filled with odd characters. While I'm not going to get into my issues with Victorious, I will state that the show managed to still have one lone protagonist and kept with it, even with major side characters having their own arcs. Victorious was entirely about Tori, and it stayed that way. 
The issue with both those shows' way of executing their premise is that they make the side characters more interesting than the supposed protagonist of the series. I find Tokoyami a much more interesting character than Deku, for instance. Deku, when compared to other characters, doesn't hold up. He doesn't have any specific qualities or anything about him that set him apart, even if he has One for All. He's determined, but so is everyone else. He wants to be a hero, but everyone else does as well. He's brave and calculating, but so is Momo, Todoroki, etc.
To relate Deku to another ""everyman hero"", let's talk about Spider-Man. He's a beloved superhero. His power is ubiquitous with who he is as a person. His backstory provides strong motivation, and he's intensely set on saving people, even if it breaks him. In contrast, Deku really has no motivation to be a hero other than the fact that he wants to emulate his personal hero, All Might. He's just dead set on being one.
His power is also basically separate from him as a person, which one could argue is the newness of it to him and the danger of its use, but Deku doesn't own the power, so to speak. Unlike Bakugo or Todoroki, his power isn't a part of him. It's just some thing off to the side.
Everyone wants to be a hero, literally. He's an okay character, and I like him, but he just doesn't hold up compared to the others. One for All is literally just him blasting his way through things as he breaks bones. It's just enhanced strength and raw power. That's all it is. For a Quirk that supposedly gains strength and abilities through its holders, it's only one ability. It's just bland and has none of the charm or intrigue of Dark Shadow, Momo's Creation, etc. 
IN CONCLUSION:
BNHA is a decent watch, but the issues tend to run deep. If you like superheroes, I'd give it a watch, and Deku is an okay protagonist, even if he pales in comparison.",6,Alumina-Illumina

                I like this Anime, It will be my favorite list, I know FUNIMATION made this series because it's amazing and how beautiful it is, Deku try's to be a superhero like him and his fans when he was a little boy, but he was an autistic thing about being strong and her Mom was crying because of the video he watch that was a tragic since the early 2000's, Deku grow's up as a Teenager for sure and he saw All Might but he was really shocked and he was a happy kind Japenese person in the world.
I hope this will be a masterpiece but
                  plze don't hate this show, It's the best Anime in Spring 2016, Season 2 will be fresh if it had best character designs and Animtion's for Japan

                (This is my fifth review, yay.) 
So, Boku No Hero Academia was really and I mean REALLY popular when it came out in 2016, and it’s still extremely popular today. Does it deserve it’s popularity and hype? Yes, absolutely without a doubt, this is one of the greatest shounen animes out there and if you like shounen and action then I would definitely recommend My Hero Academia. 
Story: 7/10
The story is quite generic. It’s kids going to a school to learn how to be heroes and fight against villains. But I can’t complain since there were almost no plot holes and the story progressively gets
                  more engaging each episode.
Animation: 9/10
Bones Inc did a good job on the animation for sure. A lot of the fight scenes were smoothly animated and very intense and there were almost no animation errors. 
Sound: 8/10
The opening song is nice and it is very fitting. The ending song was also good but definitely not as catchy and cool as the opening song. Now, let’s get on with the voice acting. Honestly you can watch this dubbed or subbed. They both sound great. In the english dub the characters voices fit very well with their personalities and in the japanese dub the voices also fit.
Characters: 6/10 
There were so many characters but a lot of them didn’t really even contribute to the story. They were sort of just….there. But they all had cool quirks and they didn’t get too much unnecessary screen time so that’s a plus. Aside from the minor characters, The main characters, Deku and Bakugo are very well written. There is a rivalry between them and it is shown by the way they interact with each other. Bakugo is impertinent and very aggressive and mean to Deku, while Deku is very kind and thoughtful. A really good thing about the characters is that none of them have the same personalities which makes them pretty interesting even if they don’t have much contributions to the story or don’t do a lot in the show.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Everything about this anime is pretty good.  Again it’s my favorite anime and if you like shonen and action you should definitely watch this. 
Overall: 10/10
This anime is awesome and even though it might not have the most original plot you’ve got to admit the characters are really well written and it’s super entertaining. 10/10",10,Ubume

                After hearing about all the hype behind the third season of Boku no Hero, I decided to get my normie ass through the first two seasons and see if the third is any worth watching. And, well... While the first season wasn't all that terrific, it shows some promise for the next two seasons, which I have happily moved closer to the top of my PTW list. Here is my short, no bs review.
(I rate anime a little differently, and am currently working on a explanation on my page. In short, I consider Plot and Story to be separate entities, and include the op/ed in
                  the rating.)
OP/ED: 7/10 
Great op, avg ed.
Music: 7/10 
Good during emotional parts, but nothing special everywhere else. But that's where the music needs to be good, right? So I gave it a bit more credit for that.
Characters: 8/10 
While there was a very big cast, it was a little too much for a 12 ep show. So we got the least amount of characterization on the side characters, that were actually interesting. The main characters were quite bland, with the creativity seen in some of the superpowers of the supporting characters, I was expecting something better from Deku and All Might.
Story: 4/10 
The setting brings up plot holes, which involves some spoilers, so I'll keep em to myself. Though Boku no Hero is another ""Super hero high school"" thing, it wasn't half bad and quite interesting from time to time. 
on the other hand, the setting did not get nearly enough of an explanation. And I get it, it's a 12 episode show, so some credit needs to be given. But that doesn't cover the fact that the explanation for the existence of superpowers was lazy as hell. The excuse that some people just randomly had them at birth shows lazy writing.
Plot: 6/10 
Off to a rough start, but got better as it went along. The anime tried to tell two different stories, neither were bad, but also not that great. The plot arc is defined, but it didn't really have that much of a climax, as there was no main antagonist.
Personal Thoughts/Enjoyment: 7/10 
I'm not normally a fan of these ""Super Hero High school"" stories, but the unique side characters that are introduced in the show proved to be my biggest enticement to continue watching.
Aesthetics (VA+Art): 6/10
The show had a somewhat unique art style, mimicking North American comics. However, the voice acting never shined bright, and remained pretty average throughout. 
FINAL SCORE: 6/10

every anime fan in 2016-2018: bro this is the best action anime ever made, the fights are so cool, the characters are so cool its gonna be the next naruto, u have to watch it it'll change ur life bro!!
me, watching it 6 years too late for the hype: lmao broccoli boi hit big man go brrrrr
i'll be reviewing this show in a more personal/blind watch format, so future reviews will only make reference to past seasons i've already covered.
to sum up my thoughts: it's pretty good! its shown enough redeemable qualities to where i'm interested in seeing how it'll be developed later.
                  this isn't to say that i think this season can be easily skipped as i still enjoyed it, but the major highlights for me are the characters and worldbuilding.
almost every character is distinctive and memorable from a combination of top-notch visual design, quirk implementation and personality, even if most of the student characters take a backseat in favor of developing deku and all-might.
deku sometimes skews more whiny than likable, but he's endlessly optimistic and willing to push himself to a ridiculous extent to attain noble goals and protect others from certain doom (not like my lazy butt lol). obviously a good kid if a bit of a crybaby, not my fav but still like him overall.
all might's the most interesting and well developed character of the whole cast so far, and thus he's ended up being one of my favorites despite how creepy he looks. mans is just dealing with a tough dilemma. the whole injury and slow decline in power things are also interesting plot devices.
this is also the first piece of superhero-related media i’ve seen that tackles superpowers as a phenomenon and how people would realistically react to them, and i think this works excellently as a hook into the... what, magic system? it's not really magic but yall get it. i absolutely love how creative the quirks are and how characters use them in different situations, and that alone makes for plenty of fun scenes.
despite my praises, i did notice a few issues that bogged down my viewing experience, the biggest one being a sheer overabundance of unnecessary flashbacks every few minutes or so.
for those who don't know, i am not a goldfish. i can remember scenes from previous episodes and how they relate to current events. i do not like obvious information being rammed into my orifices and having my immersion shattered in the scene that should be playing instead of a flashback and then ANOTHER flashback and then ONE MORE just in case. this might not sound like a big deal, but it adds up.
another less severe issue is spoken exposition taking place between two characters who both know about the information being said, but one explains it to the other as if they don't (aka poorly written butler-maid dialogue). this technically gets the exposition across, but there's no in-universe explanation as to why this conversation is taking place. this happened at least three or four times and took me out of the experience just from how nonsensical it sounded once i recognized it.
this season from start to finish feels more like an introduction to the rest of the show which slows down it’s pacing significantly. despite this, i never felt bored by it to the point of losing interest thanks to it’s solid art direction, cute character interactions and good sense of stakes each episode. 
for those interested in my mad ramblings, i’ll come back and leave a note here letting yall know that i’ve written a review for the next season!

                I usually avoid any type of shonen anime because frankly, you've seen one you've seen them all. That's probably why I avoided BNHA (anime and manga) for so long. When it came out though, I still vividly remember the hype surrounding it and how it was that one anime of the season that everyone talked about. 
Now here we are a good two years later and I've decided to watch BNHA because of a 7 hour flight I had. I needed something to do so what better more than to binge an entire anime series (Spoiler: I didn't finish it in one sitting on the
                  plane). There's something about BNHA though where everything just works? And I'll explain what I mean (Spoiler alerts I guess) 
Story: The story's nothing different. An underdog in a world full of people greater than him. Deku wants to be what he can't, until he's given the chance to be what he's always wanted to be. From that point, its him adjusting to school life as a new quirk holder. Its nothing we haven't seen before with other anime, but for some reason, I was really into it. Towards the ending of the first season is where the underlying plot starts to come out and still, its nothing we haven't seen before. But still, for something like BNHA, it works. 
Art: The art's solid. Its studio Bones, nothing more to it. (If you need some reminding, they did FMAB, Ouran, FMA, Soul Eater, etc) Its colorful and fluid and over the top and that's exactly what something like this anime needs. Each character has their own look and their own costume that says who they are and you can tell a lot of creativity and time went into each of these character's looks.  Its pretty much everything you could want and expect from a shonen anime. 
Sound: I bought the sub by accident on Itunes. As I'm catching up to the third season, I can't find myself switching to the dub anytime soon (Yes, I'm aware it won awards for the dub, but the sub just works better for me). Each character's voice fits and there's no awkward sounding characters anywhere. Its obvious they took their time picking voice actors as well. The music is alright? I can't find myself skipping the opening but other than that nothing else really stands out. (There's a rap song somewhere in there though that made me do a double take). Overall, the sound is solid as well. 
Characters: Its an ensemble anime, so that means there's going to be lots and lots of characters. Somehow (to me at least), it works very well with the characters in the first season. Deku, All Might, and Bakugo especially. It starts to introduce who everyone is towards the end and all at the same time, so its a little hard to remember who everyone is and what they do though. I wish they had done it more spaced out or a little earlier even. Its the first season, so I really hope nobody expects major character development and character motives so soon (and if so that's not really fair?) For the first season however, you get enough of each character (and a full detail speech of their quirks) to not question them any more than what you have. 
Overall Enjoyment: I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. I was prepared for overpowered characters and power of friendship speeches and defying odds but really, BNHA doesn't do that. It takes whatever kind of logic it can create in this world and explains it. As for our main protagonist Izuku, I was very pleasantly surprised that even though he was the face of the anime, he had to work for what he got. He had to prove that yes, he was deserving of the One for All quirk and it was given to him, he didn't know how to automatically use it. Even though he trained and trained to be able to even hold the ability in his body, he has to train and train some more to be able to use it (which he still isn't able to fully at the end of the first season). Its nice to see him lose and not defy odds and having to rely on other people because he knows he can't do this by himself. What better person to mentor him than his childhood hero? 
BNHA is nothing special or spectacular, but at the same time it is. It knows what it is and what it wants to be and it makes watching it over the top and fun. You want Deku, as well as the entire UA Academy and even the Pro Heroes they meet to succeed. I regret not watching this as it was coming out because it truly lived up to the hype it got.
Do I recommend BNHA? Absolutely. The only thing preventing me to a solid 10 is the full endgame of the story as a whole.",9,Unicorn819

                Going to keep this short and sweet. This show starts off brilliantly, and its world-building is top notch. You can quickly pick up on what the structure of society is all about, and slowly learn of its nuances. 
The characters are solidly placed into this world of quirks, and all that that entails, and can relate to this struggle. Our hero, Midoriya, is a young ""quirkless,"" or power-less man, struggling to find his place in a society of heroes and villains. There's something in that concept that could be extrapolated, fleshed out, and really taken advantage of, but they never do. 
It wouldn't be a
                  typical shounen cash cow if the primary antagonist didn't go through some sort of struggle, followed by an insane power-creep, would it?
Filled to the brim with tropes and predictable ho-hum, this show very swiftly discards its compelling attributes, and replaces it with a Bleach-esque power struggle that tries its hardest to undermine its own potential brilliance. It feels as if you watched an amalgam of every stereotypical shounen by the end, and maybe that's what people want.
The animation is brilliantly done, and you can tell the budget was very high for a first season. The smoothness of a notable fight near the end of the season is a testament to the skill of the studio. Liquid smooth and oozing with style, it's hard not to enjoy what's on the screen, and its a wonderful way to cap an otherwise somewhat boring show. Though this is always typically done in anime, the execution lies within the creators' talents, and they were not found wanting.
But again, its predictable. And maybe this is what people want. Predictability. Safety. Thoughtlessness. Sure, its easy to watch, but what is the cost? Just watch HxH, it's essentially the same story but told better, and with more interesting characters.",5,Kruggtheamazing

Boku no Hero Academia is a great anime. Before I started it I was already excited because of the cover art. When i watched it i was automatically enticed. This is not your normal cliche superhero anime. I was actually surprised when i found out Midoriya did not have a quirk. Unlike other anime, the main character doesn't have much of a bravado and isn't very confident. I relate to him in a metaphorical way because there are so many people with talent and probably a lot more without. The story of Midoriya shows perseverance and striving for the best. You can really
                  tell the creator also spent much time on the characters because they are all different and not cliche in any way. I also really like this anime because it follows the manga closely and isn't that different from the manga. I enjoyed watching the characters grow. The art, animation and voice acting is also very good. I could believe that they actually felt these things, and you can actually see the fighting scenes. The action isn't just a blur of lines and smudges and the artists pays much attention to detail. Overall I would definitely recommend this stellar anime to a friend.",9,anchovyrat

                My Hero Academia isn't a bad series, but is it really worth the time? 
I watched this show as one of my first anime, chucking shows that I'd heard of on and seeing how I liked them. MHA being probably the single most mainstream series of today I had heard a lot about this one and decided to give it a shot, but even then I hadn't enjoyed it all that much. 
I had caught up on it when season 5 started, and at that point, I asked myself whether it was worth it to continue with the series. I figured I'd drop it, but
                  when you're 4 seasons and 2 movies into a show that's not as easy as it seems. I continued watching. About 2 episodes into this new season I got impatient. I didn't want to wait another week to watch something I could easily go read for myself. So I did as you'd assume and read the manga. 
By god, I wish someone told me earlier how much better it is to the anime. I hate to be that one manga reader who says the manga is better than the anime just because they read it before it was adapted, but I don't think this is much of a competition. Although even then... Is it worth it? 200 chapters in it gets good and really, I wish I'd spent the time I did on this series I did on something else. 
So here's the final verdict. My Hero is good. It's a good show. But that's it. It ultimately isn't worth the time you'd spend watching it when you could be doing or watching something else.",7,nachyochiz

                As we know Boku no Hero Academia is the brand new shounen anime Which is being produced by Shounen Jump currently . It started airing on 2016 and season 1 had 12 episodes. Currently it is at season 2 ep 4/24 and manga is at chapter 136. (Potential SPOILERS ahead )
Well let me summarize the story. In the super human society where the MC lives .. every human have a super power called quirks which comes in different forms, like quirk to control fire , become invisible.. in a word super power. Now due to that to maintain law and order a new government profession
                  came to existence i.e Hero's. In that society people strive to be the best hero. Among all the Heroes All Might is no 1 and The Symbol of Peace. Now our young Midorya Izunuku wants to become the no 1 hero. But unfortunately he turns out to be quirk less ...that is until he met All Might. Despite being powerless and teased he strives to be a hero and didn't think twice before saving anyone. Such quality impressed All Might and so Midorya became the Successor for One for All. And he joins U.A the best hero school and the story begins .. it's the story of how he became the world's no 1 hero.
So now let's get to the point why it is the best to me by discussing the Quality of anime
1. Story :It has a good story. Well a good story is always required for a better anime. Example Naruto. It has one of the best stories ever. Well BNH might not have stories like Naruto but still its good enough to get 8/10. Not to mention arcs aren't messed up .
2. Characters: Its one of the most important part of Anime. In this anime the Author focused a lot on each and every characters. Example even after making Deku powerless he was smart and a good strategist despite acting like a stupid some times. We know that Bukago is a hot head but despite the fact He knows what he must do in times ( watch BNH jump festa ep) and he has respect for his opponent .. well you will get the best example of that in Bukago vs Uraraka battle. Then there is Todoroki with family problems and Yuyuroza, Ida .. each and every character have some problems like Ida's brother being ***** by hero killer , Todoroki refusal to use fire , Deku's and Bukago's big misunderstanding (read Kacchan vs Deku manga chapter to understand ). The Author also put a lot of work in Side characters for best example we can see it in the red riots debut manga chapter (134),side characters character and personality development is also shown . In a way the character creations , dealing with side characters have been done very well. Not too many Shounen anime did this. Yes Naruto had this but not to forget those were in filler episodes ,DBZ web we can see how well the Handel Yamacha .. Well FT is a mentionable anime which handled side characters well. Remember Mystagon from FT. One piece is also worth mention in here. In this manga parents and adults also have a major role. Not many shounen does it . It most shounen you will find carefree parents or like in HxH missing parents. But this anime does an extraordinary job in this sector.
3.Animation and Art style : I don't think I have to explain this part .. right ? Well since its 2016 anime it have a better animation style then most other shounen anime.
4. Plot twists : This is a very vital factor that makes an anime very interesting . An anime without plot twist is very predictable and boring. This story have a lot of amazing plot twist. , like How Team Midorya won in round 2 , Nomus appearance and identity , Hero killer , Todoroki using fire again , Deku vs Kacchan , All for One.. the biggest plot twists are Night eyes vision about all might and Identity of the Leader of league of villains. The story contains major plot twists that makes it impossible to predict what's gonna happen next . I am not gonna mention the plot twists of Hero Provisional License Arc. Naruto and Bleach had a lot of Plot twists too. Gintama is also an anime with huge plot twists. Not to mention FT that loves trolling.(shitty trolls)
5. Story development : Yes it is a vital . Naruto was a hit due to its story development. The depth and darkness of a story is also important .HxH have a deep and awesome story development which made it a master piece . In BNH the stories gets more darker and more deeper as well as me mysteries are discovered with each arc. That's why it has one of the best story development.
6. Overpowered Characters : Every anime have at list one over powered character . In BNH there are a lot of them. But the writer handled them well. The more strong a character is the more limit he has. Example All Might's time limit , Mydoria's body and his Arm , Todoroki's body temperature problem , the lightning kids mental breakdown problem , laser kids stomach ace , Uraraka's weight limit , Asyu's organ problem .... and so on. The anime ensured power , limiter and a way to overcome it for every characters of story. That's the main reason we love it. Yes there are still overpowered villains like All for One but he can be defeat by One For All holder. The story doesn't have ridiculously over powered character ...not like DBS and SAO at least .
7. VILLEINS : Yes . They are important. BNHA have made pretty interesting and mysterious villeins making it a interesting story. It have overpowered , strong , cunning , intelligent villeins as well as shitty fathers like Overhaul. At least they made dark and pure evil VILLEINS not some shitty villeins like DBS (with a few exceptions)
Since the Anime handled the above characters well I think its the best. Not to mention the epic fight scene and animation.",9,Ahmed_Mahdi

                I made a review of this earlier, but decided to update it after seeing the anime and seeing how it finished.
So... I'm not sure if you read my older review on here, but I basically stated that ""I was disappointed with how the anime went because although it had great pacing, great animation, great music etc. It would not be able to fully flesh out and develop the story in only 13 episodes because it ends at a bad time (if you read the manga you know what I'm talking about). Although it will be good, it won't be as good as it could have
                  been."" 
I still agree with everything I said, the only difference now though is that now that I know this anime series is planning on having at least a 2nd season, it will be absolutely superb. 
For those who have not read the manga, the amount that the anime shows you only goes up to a very small part of the show. Nothing has actually happened YET. This was more like the introduction, but now that I know a 2nd season is coming?? OH HO HOOOOOO HERE WE GO!!!!
A lot more will be presented in the 2nd season, and you will see all the KICK ASS action (hopefully if it's going to show the parts that I am thinking of) and all that amazing character development that is shown in the manga. 
So boku no hero academia season 1 was great, for an intro. to the series. If it was it's own stand alone work I'd give it like a 7 at most. But now that I know it's simply an introduction to the series, Ima give it an 8.
The reason for this is because it ended amazingly, and ended perfectly for an intro to take place, it gave you enough to learn about this environment that you're put in and gave you enough juices to like/love it. It also ended on a solid point, and gave you a fulfilling end when you finished it, it also left you with a little cliff hanger towards the very end keeping you anticipating for more coming from the series. 
God I love this series. They did everything so superbly. 
P.S. One thing I would like to mention that I had stated in my older review.
I noticed that the color scheme at the beginning was very childish. Like they made everything really bright and vibrant which I felt didn't suit the series, well for the introduction of the series it did but later on the show takes a serious and ""dark"" turn which is why I though ""Oh God I hope this is on purpose and that they will give the appropriate color scheme and atmosphere when shit gets real."" And they did, for every situation, and just God I love this anime adaptation. And the music fit, the characters were awesome, God I love this show.",9,SovietPsycho

                Boku no Hero Aacademia may not have anything new to offer but it sure is one entertaining anime. This anime is very similar to other shounen anime. Where the main character is weak compared to others, but has big dreams. Also, like many other shounen there is a rival who is almost the opposite of the main character. 
Story
In this world about 80% of the population possesses quirks-special powers. Our main character's dream is to become a hero like All Might-strongest hero of justice. The only problem is that our hero is part of the 20% of the population. 
Animation/Art
Both  are very good. Art
                  and animation make the costumes and powers stand out. 
Sound
Nothing too impressive but it's pretty decent. 
Characters
Only 3 main characters get a good amount of development in this season. Other character are cool but we really don't know much about them. Hoping season 2 will give them more development.
Enjoyment
This is where the show really shines. It's very enjoyable. Similar to Marvel movies, it's nothing too complex but it's very entertaining to watch. 
Overall season 1 is very good. It sets up the show very well. If you like shounen and superheros then this show is a must watch. Even if your not a fan of shounen, give it a try you'll probably at least find some enjoyment out of it.",8,FlyingThunder_GD

                I remember thinking,before I watched this, ""eh it's just some superhero high school story.How great can it REALLY be?""
Now,this is one of my favorite anime's ever.The story was very creative,I was hooked from episode 1.The main character is impossible to hate,in fact,every character in this show is enjoyable.They were really what made me keep watching.The animation was REALLY good,it was just so over the top.
what didnt I like about this anime? well,it was very,very,very LOUD 
I'm not kidding,the main character yelled like every other 5 minutes,and I could not even turn the sound off because,my tv does not have subtitles.Yeah. and I  watched this
                  at night,so that was terrible.My mother even asked me when I was watching this if it was a murder story,because of the screaming.
Besides that, I have to say,this has been the best anime,and cartoon, I have seen in a while.

31964,"
                Boku no Hero Academia is what its sypnosis says. It is an anime about superheroes, in ways, a comic book turned anime. 
I'll try to keep it short and simple:
Story:
The story doesn't come as a shocker, and anyone can guess the plot-line directly after reading the synopsis. It's a straightforward story that doesn't strangle your mind with complicated twists.
Art:
The art is what you'd want to expect from a world of heroes and villains. It is not by any means crisp or drawn with cutting edge animations, but it rather gives you a feel of actually watching a comic book in action. The characters are drawn
                  well-enough, with shading and lighting that gives each character a heroic or antagonistic appearance.  
Sound:
This is what shocked me the most. I for one am not a fan of listening to the opening songs and ending songs in every episode; but the songs in this anime was something you could keep on hearing and jam to.
Character:
There wasn't much character development apart from the main character and another character to be honest. There also isn't a lot of background details given for characters. However, you have to appreciate the characters for what you see in the anime and judge them accordingly; all the characters are pretty straight-forward.
Enjoyment:
This is what the anime is basically all about, enjoyment. It's a universe of heroes and villains and the story of a boy who gains special powers and enrolls in a school for heroes. It is a comic in an anime, tapping somewhere into childhood fantasies of being heroes ourselves. What more could you ask for? 
Just a quick summary:
Pros:
- Opening and ending songs
- Hero Universe
- A suited story for a hero anime
- Doesn't rush it for a 13 episode anime
- Great action scenes
- Unique super powers
Cons:
- Comedy at times is a bit dull
Debatable (Differs from people to people):
- Artwork
- Cliche story-line
Personal Opinions:
With giving the basic idea of the anime, there are a lot of things that some people will find different from others, as it can be seen from the other reviews, hence, I'll give my own opinion on this anime. 
The art felt a bit disappointing in the first episode, but as it progressed, I got used to it and started to like it along the way, fitting in with the feel of the story-line. The story line is a bit cliche, but it still works. It doesn't put you off and keeps you intrigued of what goes down in the next episode. 
Overall:
Boku no Hero Academia taps into our childhood fantasies of becoming super-heroes, and puts it into this anime. It is an enjoyable anime, giving us an anime that puts a comic into life. 
If you're looking for an anime with deep character backgrounds, unique story-line, multiple twists and a dark truth behind all the extravagance, trying to make logic out of every detail, this anime is not for you. 
If you, however, want to enjoy yourself with 13 episodes of heroic, edge-of-your-seat action, unique super powers, hero-school training, villain-worthy villains and an appetite to save others, this anime is for you. Remember, even you can be a hero.",8,Hi-no-Tori

                With the big three Shonen series (Except of course for One Piece) finally seeming to be dead and gone it was only a matter of time before a new Shonen Jump long runner came along to stand shoulder the shoulder with HunterxHunter. 
My Hero Academia aims to be that series and while it has little new to offer in terms of groundbreaking takes on western superheroes in anime, at least nothing the Tiger and Bunny and One Punch Man haven't already said well enough on their own, this series is very good at being exactly what it it. A Shonen designed to be as long
                  running as possible with as many interesting grudge matches, human character interactions and dynamic arcs to keep you engaged until then.
I will not lie, the story is par for the course, even so far with any superhuman high school story we've all seen a million times over our fandom experience, looking through any of our lists will yield at least one series with a similar premise, it is almost guaranteed. How My Hero succeeds is in that it is very good at being just that.
Fights are dynamic with Bones at the helm, seeming no less skilled in their craft in what could've been a back burner series carried along by the Shonen Jump label alone and most likely broken even for a good enough stretch.
Sound is passing, with all the background music fitting perfectly into it's place. The score is only as it is because of the amazing ""My Day"" by Porno Graffiti which serves as the OP.
How this series will sink or swim however will be, with any real superhero story, on how much the audience can find something to love about our characters and become invested in fight scenes that must be enjoyable in an of themselves. This is My Hero's greatest strength. As a superhero geek I will say that the heroes, like many western style heroes created recently in Japan is that they lack a motif or their motif is convoluted or not well thought out. A very disappointing example of this is a space suit themed hero with black hole powers that instead of names like ""Orbit"", ""Hayabusa"" or ""NASA"" was named ""13"" a mantle whose meaning still puzzles me. 
The series also does an almost Jojo esque job of mixing in familiar power sets such as Super Speed, Anti Gravity and Animal features with more offbeat and situational powers that all get their spots to shine, though some of the cast is left in the cold with only 13 episodes running.
Overall while My Hero Academia wont really be anyone's new FMA or Bebop it is entirely possible that it will serve as the Naruto of the anime generations going forward, and this series proves to establish a firm bedrock for good action anime for them.",7,Kakuman1995

Boku no Heroe Academia,that anime that NOBODY has heard speak, if today you have not heard of this anime (because you live in a cave or something like that) here comes a very quick summary: A world with many people with superpowers and our protagonist, wants to be a superhero but does not have superpowers,but he recive (because he is the protagonist) and that's it.
The story has nothing innovative, your typical character story that wants to be the number in one in something,has nothing innovative, if you have already seen naruto and HxH
                  and you liked probably you like BNHA, it's your typical fight anime, super bad guys, super good guys as the characters mature and develop physically and emotionally, the story is very simple, it's just this, in between adds some thing about the good and the society (which remains merely superficial)but mainly focuses on the powers and the personages (although I would like that it was focused in more subjects).
oh and also has some other plot convenience.
About the characters, what I can say about them, their presentation is horrible, they are very flat or with personalities that makes them very detestable, weeping, childish although over time some change something, others remain (at least during this season), the majority are generics and flat and those who are not flat are not bearable, villains are bad because they are bad and their personal motivations are mostly generic and nothing special.
As for the graphic section is the best of the anime, good animation, fluid and detailed with adrenalinic fights (seal of quality of BONES), without low quality, with an abundant use of light colors and warm, the best point of the anime.
The music is mostly generic, with some notable theme but most of the soundtracks are not good or bad, are generic for a fight anime.
In general is your anime type of fights, but with a horrible presentation, may end up being a good thing in the future, but at the moment there is a generic anime with very badly presented peronajes, an anime that has started bad but with something future potential if it develops correctly.
FINAL NOTE:4/10
ESPAÑOL
Boku no Hero Academia,un anime del que NADIE ha oído hablar,si aun no has oído hablar de este anime (porque vives debajo de una roca o has estado secuestrado o algo así) aquí viene un resumen muy corto:un mundo con mucha gente con súperpoderes y nuestro protagonista busca ser superheroe,pero no tiene superpoderes,pero los recibe (porque es el protagonista) y eso es todo.
La historia no tiene nada innovador, tu historia típica de un personaje que quiere ser el número en uno en algo,nada innovador, si ya has visto Naruto y HxH y te gustó probablemente te gustará BNHA, es tu típico anime de peleas,malos súper malos ,buenos súper buenos y la historia de como los personajes maduran y se desarrollan físicamente y emocionalmente, la historia es muy simple, es justo esto,a veces añade algo sobre el bien y la sociedad (que se queda en algo superficial) pero se centra principalmente en los poderes y los personajes (aunque me gustaría que se centrara en más temas).
Ah y tiene alguna que otra conveniencia argumental.
Sobre los personajes,que puedo decir de ellos,su presentación es horrible, son muy planos o con personalidades que los hacen muy detestables,llorones,infantiles aunque con el tiempo algunos cambian algo, otros permanecen iguales (al menos durante esta temporada),la mayoría son genéricos y planos y los que no son planos no son tolerables,los villanos son malos porque son malos y sus motivaciones personales son en su mayoría genéricas y nada especiales.
En cuanto al apartado gráfico es lo mejor del anime, buena animación, fluida y detallada con peleas adrenalínicas (sello de calidad del estudio BONES), sin bajones de calidad,con un uso abundante de colores claros y cálidos, el mejor punto del anime.
La música es en su mayoría genérica,con algún tema notable, pero la mayoría de los temas musicales no son buenas o malos,son temas  genéricos para un anime de peleas.
En general es tu típico anime de peleas,con una presentación horrible,pero que puede acabar siendo un buen anime en el futuro, pero por el momento es un anime genérico con peronajes muy mal presentados,un anime que ha empezado mal (MUY mal) pero con algo potencial futuro si se desarrolla correctamente.

It's MONTHS that I have to look at it and, finally, I managed to start this anime. I found it thanks to One Piece, because many people say it may be its heir, so I said, ""Why not look at it?""
Anyway, let’s move on to the review. I found it very interesting and good although, in just twelve episodes, the ability to give a full review obviously does not exist. So I’m going to be very brief, without spoiler season two.
The characters are interesting, although still not very thorough, they are all different and all have their
                  characteristics and peculiarities. I find it very interesting that any power has its own weakness or side effect, remind them that they are still human.
Despite this I find many differences between the powers and the difference in strength at times, it is really a lot, for example between Shoto and Tsuyu, the power of him is double and useful in every context, while she is useful practically only in a certain place.
For what little I have seen of villain, they seem to me very beautiful aesthetically and interesting character, as well as the good characters, like the professors, and I hope they are not superficial.
There are two things I don’t like at all, the first is the existence of Mineta. That character is USELESS, hideous, annoying, not funny and, if you find he funny, please, think about your concept of fun, he’s really stupid and I don’t understand why he was created.
The second thing, which I can already see, is how Yaoyorozu, and probably other women, are sexualized. What’s the fun in that? They’re minors, please stop. It’s embarrassing.
I know you could be like, ""Bro (sis*), it’s just an anime."" Yeah, ""bro,"" but if you want to see half-naked women, there’s ecchi and hentai for that.
However, apart from these personal things that don’t spoil the plot, I can say that in context it seems like a good anime and the relationship between the characters is good. Right now Bakugo and Shoto are my favorite characters and I know they’ll get better again, so I can’t wait to see them.",8,Laila_Vinsmoke

                In my opinion the story was un thought out and it was clear that nobody really knew what was going to happen next
Deku is sooo annoying and there are thousands of different characters with actually good story arcs that would have been amazing protagonists but deku makes me want to yeet myself off of a building
The antagonists are never really a threat and because of the huge network of hero's it makes no since for any of the villain groups to be targeting students even the main villain is kind of cast aside after a couple episodes and the constant change in villain makes the
                  story really hard to engage with
the characters with really cool story's that I mentioned before are all retconned or just never shown again afterwards just leaving you with deku and kachan who are the most annoying anime duo ever and if your listening to them on head phones it legit made my ears bleed.
the other characters in the class are never discussed and are purely there so this can be seen as a classroom
I'd give this like a 0 for everything apart from animation its a terrible show and a huge waste of time I wouldn't recommend it to any one",1,Blank_67

                This is my first review so any feedback would be appreciated
MHA, a story inspired by American Superheroes. It was really exciting when it came out, because it was somewhat close too One punch man which is fairly popular even today. MHA was really well received in the general audience, but it disappointed me personally.  
Story: 6/10
The story is a stereotypical Shonen. Underdog protagonist, cocky and talented rival, Good vs Evil, power of friendship etc. That isn't a problem, but when your story is ONLY that, than it is a problem. Anyway, in this world 80% of the population have superpowers called ''quirks''. We have
                  our protagonist Deku who was born without a quirk, so he got bullied by his friend Bakugo, and on a fateful day he gets All-might, his idol's power. Honestly it's like I'm reading a silver-age comic book. The story is just there to compliment the characters(who are not THAT good) and action. Overall it's just a bare minimum of a story, which I don't like.
Art: 8/10
This is the show's strongest point. I mean it's done by ''Bones'' so of course it'll be good. The fights are smooth and really well choreographed. The costumes and quirks are really well illustrated, and so are (some of) the characters. I also like the comic book aesthetic. Overall, Great work Bones!
Sound: 7/10
The OST isn't bad but it's not that memorable. Apart from ''My Hero Academia"" and ""You say Run"" I can't name one of the songs. The voice acting didn't bother me and   the SFX were really nice. I just can't give it more than a 7, comparing it to other series.
Characters: 6/10
The Cast was supposed to save this series, but there are 4-5 interesting characters at best. Most of the others are easily forgettable. Bakugo is just cocky and every 
1-A student is fairly bland, except for maybe Aoyama, but he barely gets any screen time. The character that was okay was Aizawa because he was this mysterious, cool and powerful guy. Another one is Kirishima, but season 1 is not his season. Ochako is just your regular naïve girl and All-might is just Captain America. Overall had potential but was screwed
Enjoyment: 6/10
In my opinion this is the most important and biased category. I liked some of MHA, mostly the action, but everything else I had seen before in different series like Naruto and One piece. I don't enjoy the wasted characters the most so the brings it down from a 7 for me
Overall: 6/10
Would I recommend it? If you're new to Shonen or Anime in general give it a watch.
If you are an avid watcher of Anime, and you haven't watched this by ANY chance, I don't think you'll like it.
Thank you for reading! Constructive criticism is appreciated!",6,Build0001

                An anime like Boku No Hero Academia is one that follows classic Shuonen tropes but adds a little bit of flavor to it in order to make it more appetizing to the palette. 
The creator of the Manga has said that his primary source of inspiration was Kishimoto's Naruto, and as such you can draw direct parallels between Naruto's characters and characters from this show. 
You have a  underdog with a pure heart for a protagonist, who has a childhood rival that he always wanted to surpass and has inherited a great amount of power from his idol and is now determined to make
                  his name known throughout the Super-Hero world. What makes the whole series work though is the versatility of the characters' powers and how they function with each other both during and outside of direct combat. 
Add to this an excellent soundtrack and superb artwork and you basically have a show that although doesn't really re-invent the genre but successfully takes the best elements of the genre and highlights them splendidly over the course of 13 episodes. I'm currently reading the Manga with great interest, and I would highly recommend people to pick up the Manga as well...because you ain't seen nothin yet.",9,DemonKingRavan

                When I talk about DC Comics or Marvel, and I criticize the regular, passable or interesting things (never bad) they do, I always have in mind two great motors as were ""The Avengers"" or the Batman trilogy filmed by Nolan (especially  ""The Dark Knight""). I ain't a big fan of this gender of heroes and superheroes and, still, I have watched most of these films so I can have a specific opinion and some values to offer to my readers.
In the same way, I am not a big fan of ""shonen"": it's true that there are big exceptions like ""Dragon Ball"" or ""Death Note"",
                  and these are, of course, some of the biggest exemples in my list (and some of the highest in position), but this doesn't mean that this gender passionates me. ""My Hero Academia"", or ""Boku No Hero: Academia"" has been able to prove me wrong once more, as these examples did before, in many senses.
I want to start saying that this critic is about the first 13 episodes, as I haven't watched the second season (which in fact lasts almost the double). I point that I'm looking forward to keep watching Deku, Uraraka and all of the characters in the screen, and that I will probably these following days.
I have read great things about the development of this series, especially in its second season, and I must say that I believe them entirely. Even if ""BnH"" is an example of simplicity and has a lack of originality, as it is what it is and we can't expect to watch ""Inception"" or ""Serial Experiments Lain"", at least, this anime does something extremely good, and does something new not only to shonen, but also to anime in general: a group of very interesting and well-written characters.
""Boku No Hero"" faces a huge issue: to present these characters (which are many) in a lapsus of time very short (13 episodes, as I said). Do you want to know what's best? It affronts this stone in its way almost having fun of it. With one or two sentences, ""BnH"" is able to present these characters in a quick and effective way, without wondering about developping them as it wouldn't work, or showing us their pasts; simply, it exposes its characters and announces what's coming in future seasons.
This would be a big problem if it wouldn't wake the viewer's interest, but all (or almost) of them wakes interest. Here enters the importance of visual: given to some incredible models, to some striking desings and to very concrete characteristics (and different the ones from the others), most of these characters are able to take place in our mind. Maybe it's hard to remember all of their names, especially for us occidentals, but I'm sure that all of these phisical appareances will stay in your mind.
That's how a first season should work: as an introduction if your goal is to develop the story slowly and peacefully in future products. Just to give you an example, the biggest excuse of those who defend ""Attack on Titan"" (first season) is that the first 25 episodes are just an introduction. I'm sorry to say that this ain't a reason to write flat and superficial characters: different fronts are open and later on stay in oblivion. The characters don't breath as they should, and they are used as weapons to force the story. This takes a lot of credibility. I'm only saying this as an exemple; you have my opinion about ""Aot"" in my profil.
""Boku No Hero"" gets to do exactly the contrary: it presents a lot of characters and, in its 13 first episodes (half of AoT) offers to them a moment of glory. Maybe they're not relevant, maybe they're not deep, but putting this patrons in the screen so soon and in a serie that starts in such a modest (and not mediocre) way would be overloading a script which goal is to move forward calmly.
It's true that we could ask something more about all of this; it's true that it's far from being brillant, sublime or perfect, as a shonen is what it is, and few examples like ""Death Note"" show us what you really can do in a screen directer for youth, but at least, ""My Hero Academia"" is able to do something different from the other shonen and creates a very worthy interest for what's coming.
There will always be detractors about great pieces, who avoid anime being stuck in big trunk like ""Hajimete No Gal"". It's a very unworthy situation that works this way in all industry and in all media. If it happens in true cinema, why wouldn't it in japanese drawing?",7,Yuee12

                Boku no Hero Academia is often credited with revitalized the saturated shounen genre. Many people see it as a show that incorporates the best aspects of shounen battle anime without deconstructing the genre or incorporating a dark twist. While it is refreshing to have a show that doesn't try to be unnecessarily edgy or intellectual, Hero Aca still falls short in numerous departments. 
Story 7- Hero Aca premise about a boy born without powers is a world where over 90% of the population manifests a special ability or quirk, had me hooked from the very start. It's a premise that is easy for anyone to
                  relate to, and one with a strong emotional foundation to get viewers to care about the primary characters from the very start. Even now, as a college student, I can relate more than ever to wishing that someone would give me one chance to succeed in the competitive world, much like how All Might passes on One for All for Deku. This premise is enough to keep the show moving for the first few episodes, but midway through pacing becomes a massive issue. Despite being only 13 episodes long, after episode 5 the show slows down dramatically and passing from arc to arc can begin to feel like a chore
Art 5- Considering that Hero Aca was produced by studio bones, a studio is known for vibrant color pallets, expressive character animation, and bombastic fight scenes, I was expecting the animation to be top tier. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Outside of a few instances of hype animation, the artwork for Hero Aca is incredibly flat. Characters are stiff and barely move. Backgrounds feel boring and lifeless, especially in classroom settings. While there are some pretty great fights, they are not outstanding enough to make up for the generic animation overall. When compared to Mob Psycho 100, Space Dandy, and even Soul Eater the animation simply doesn't hold up 
Sound- The soundtrack of Hero Aca is by far my favorite aspect of the series, aside from its premise. HERO A never fails to send chills down my spine while You Say Run is always timed perfectly with fight scenes. The OP is pretty standard but still manages to build hype.
Character- The problem with Hero Aca's characters is that they introduce too many too fast. The first 3 episodes center entirely on Deku and his relationship with All Might and Bakugo. These three episodes flesh out these characters tremendously in such a short period of time, especially Deku. Afterwards, we are introduced to supporting characters Uraraka and Iida, but before they can be fleshed out even remotely as much as Deku, we are introduced to an entire class with 16 addition characters as well as numerous instructors, and then a group of villains on top of that. Remember each characters personality, quirk, or even name is nearly impossible on a single viewing. 
Enjoyment/Overall 6- While it may appear that I am being overly critical of this series, I am only doing so for two reasons. For one, while I feel that Hero Aca has a great premise and a great main character, it has a long way to go before it can be viewed as the savior of the shounen genre. The second reason is that the 2nd season of Hero Aca is absolutely phenomenal and corrects most of the issues I've discussed above. While Hero Aca may not be a masterpiece, it is the predecessor to something quite possibly revolutionary.",6,jballot1234

                Who are you and why haven't you watched this show!? Have you been living under a rock for the past five years? 
Where do I even begin to review this anime? 
You've got an adorable cinnamon roll protagonist, interesting and complex villains, and a memorable ensemble cast that will have you pulling your hair out trying to figure out which of these characters is your favorite. 
It's got an amazing  soundtrack that pairs beautifully with the colorful and distinct animation. 
The story itself is the quintessential underdog story that takes the cliche's of your typical Shonen and amplifies it to the tenth degree. It's
                  compared to the Shonen greats like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Bleach, but it is so much more than just your typical Shonen! It's a must watch for ANY anime fan. PERIOD!",9,Briry18
31964,"
                Things with this anime is: it is hot-blood, a bit cliche, very fluid action scene, smooth like Stein Gate, and does the job well as an anime.
I mean, the pacing of the whole anime is so nice. It is very enjoyable to watch through this popular shouen.
Yes, I know the story is not as great as Fullmetal Alchemist, but as a general audience I found the Art, All the BGM (if you noticed that the name ""porno graffitti"" appear in the opening of the Anime, trust me you can google the name safely haha, I tried it, trust me.), the way they present this anime,
                  it is top-notch.
The story is pretty usual shounen style, A boy want to have power, no power? Never mind, the guys in your neighborhood happens to have the strongest ability, and pass it to you in a bizarre way. At least in Season 1, story is not this anime biggest strength. Oh, I forget he has a gay friend as well, arrogant and stupid at the same time. 
When it comes to character development, I found it our main protagonist has a plausible character development. At the very least, he is not born with a nine tail beast (I am looking at Naruto) or someone with unexplained absurd ability on evasion and tackle girls (hello SAO). He become stronger and stronger throughout the story, in a way that make me almost believe becoming superheroes is possible.
But Boi, I enjoy this anime. It boils the blood inside me. It makes me wanna shout out: Go get it! As thought I am in the fighting scene. The fighting scene give me a feeling similar to Saitama, very enjoyable. The pacing, lighting, audio and art, everything whirl up to be an insanely satisfying tornado that leave me ""Aweeeeeee"".
If you are looking for some light, fun and action-packed anime, with a superior tempo, this is the anime for you. If you like Fullmetal Alchemist, Stein Gate, Saitama, Attack of Titan, I bet you will like this anime as well. At least there is something common in all these anime: it is a feast that you don't want to miss it.",8,ShyDeath

------------------------------------------------------
Title: My Hero Academia
A/M: Anime
Synopsis: Midoriya has always dreamed of being a hero. He’s given the opportunity in an expected way from his idol, All Might. Now he must prove his worth amongst other students with special powers, some more powerful than Midoriya’s, one of whom happens to be his childhood rival who is determined to send Midoriya home on a stretcher. 
Pros:
-Every character is delightful, and the side characters are given just the perfect amount of screen time. Leads are fully fleshed out and have complex relationships with each other and themselves that carry the narrative
-The show never betrays its lightness. While
                  it has some tender moments, the show stays relatively fun
-Trite but highly effective and relatable messaging about what being a real hero is all about
Cons:
-Doesn’t really present any new or interesting ideas to super heroes or even the genre of super hero anime
Rating: 8/10
What did YOU rate Season 1 of My Hero Academia?",8,FireDemon2021
31964,"
                So, when I just got information about a very good show that I appreciate, Attack on Titan, was getting it’s season 4 premiere in December, it was natural that I got some anticipation, just hoping, praying that this season wasn’t a rushed piece of garbage with skipping original material. At the same time, I looked back at the Attack on Titan: way back in 2013, when I was still in middle school, it premiered. It truly was good back then as well. It got so much hype...too much. As a result, despite me enjoying the show, I wasn’t a super fan, just due to the
                  cringe fanbase and overhyped attention. Sure, don’t get me wrong, it was good, and deserved attention, but it was a little too unprecedented for me. Many years later, it cooled down, and the people that stayed for the ride truly enjoy the show, and don’t mind waiting some time for it to happen. Currently, in my opinion, all the attention that it’s getting is well deserved, and any fans that still enjoy the show probably genuinely like it, since all the people who hopped on the hype train got bored years ago, when season 2 didn’t immediately get released.
So why am I going through this long ass exposition for something completely unrelated?  Well, it’s a little related. When I was thinking about how overhyped the show was, I couldn’t help but think of a contemporary example: boku no hero. God damn, its a piece of shit show, yet it has so much attention. Like, I still thought AoT was good despite the hype. Boku no hero? Just garbage, even without any of the undeserved hype. Holy shit. Where do I begin? 
It’s supposedly the new generation of shounen, but comparing it to one of the greats like one piece of naruto are doing them dirty. They’re not even on the same level. Even comparing it with AoT is a disgrace to its name. What does Boku no hero got on any of these shows? Every single one of those great shows, despite not ground-breaking, still had a unique premise, and built an incredible setting surrounding it, with great characters, action scenes, and plot. 
What about boku no hero? Mind you, I actually read the manga years before the anime was even released, so I’d say I was ahead of the curve by quite a bit, but I still can’t believe how popular it really got. Yet, even just reading the manga, I dropped it relatively early due to how bad it was.
Boku no hero is a cliche filled story. There’s nothing much unique about it. In fact, it’s so overused that parody shows about hero animes have become popular, like OPM, which is good. I’ll come back to that later.
I mean, honestly, the hero concept is so old, it can be tracked to thousands of years ago, like beowulf. Of course, Boku no hero is not just about heroes, it’s about a world where heroes are commonplace and you can train to become one! It’s about a strapping young lad that wants to become a hero!
He...has a rival/frenemy that has grade A talent, the protagonist has grade F talent...can you even be a protagonist if you don’t start out with terrible talent. But OH WAIT, he’s an UNPOLISHED GEM, the best superhero “notices” his potential, and takes him in as his successor. I’ve never seen this plot development before! Wow, his rival that he never beat, he can now match, and has more potential than he ever could imagine. Wow, school is fun, there’s so many unique people there that he can make friends with. 
I mean, you get me? The plot, it’s pretty generic, bland, and filled with cliches. And my biggest, most hated cliche of all is this sort of “fantasy school setting comedy/action.” What is the cliche about this? It’s the one where the MC goes to this fantasy school about nurturing super powers, has the most crazy things happen to him like: kidnapping, super evil battles against the enemy of the world, etc OVER AND OVER AGAIN. This is my most hated cliche of all due to how ambivalent the nature of the school setting is. One day, you’re sitting in the classroom with your chum friends and have a good time. The next, you’re fighting mutant beasts that have infiltrated the school, five of your friends are half dead, and you need to slay the monster. Then another day rolls by, and it’s as if that life or death event never happened! Why the hell are you still going to school like nothing happened? Why does this keep on happening. At some point, you got to be wondering: why is this guy still going to school if he knows he’s a high value target? At what point does this cacophonous nature of the school end? Where tense situations happen all the time, and people’s lives are in danger, or even missing, yet after all is done and resolved, you go back to your fun, sunshine daily lives? Does that make any sense at all? 
Let’s compare the cancer school setting with One piece, for example. In one piece, it’s very clear cut at where the laid back scenes and action scenes take place. When luffy’s crew is on his ship and traveling, these are the most laid back of times, since they’re no enemies. When they discover a new place, they’re safe until they encounter the enemy, and when negotiations break down. There is no conflict or chance of it, until there are good reasons to do so, or the enemy is encountered by the crew. Very cut clean and simple, none of this “sitting duck” bs where the main characters just sit around having fun in a clearly vulnerable area before getting ambushed.
. I’ll draw up another example as to why exactly I hate this stupid cliche. In boku no hero, one of the characters end up getting kidnapped, and tensions are high as no one knows where he is, if he’s in danger, and whether he’ll return alive. Makes sense. However, a few episodes later, they storm the enemy base, they save him no problem. Happy ending. Really? Let’s talk about naruto’s chuunin exam, where sasuke gets “tainted” by orochimaru. Before the exams, most of the stuff is non-lethal stuff. Fun stuff with the ninja group, school, maybe some competitions, but nothing life threatening so far. Alright, that’s fine. And then, BAM. One of the most powerful evil practitioners infiltrates the secured exam area, and infects sasuke with his mark. Unlike in Boku no Hero, this event is life changing, and it has clear long term consequences. No one is happy, and nothing gets resolved. Things only get worse, and it’s a tragedy that can’t be repeated again. Eventually, as a result of this event, Sasuke gets swept away by Orochimaru and gets turned evil. It’s a one time event, and hundreds of episodes/chapters later, it still influences the plot. Now this is what I call story and plot. None of this: everyone gets away unscathed, goes back to daily lives, and gets stronger with the power of friendship.
Alright, so I hate the setting, I hate the story, and the characters are mediocre at best. What about the world building? It’s pretty bad. The most glaring example as to why the story will never breakthrough as anything but a “shounen with action” is how poorly the worldbuilding is utilized. In a world where superpowers exist, villains exist, and heroes fight to combat them, the heroes organization should be pretty damn strong, right? It should be one of the most influential organizations in the world, with far reaches into politics, financial industries, and news, right? Well, in this series, not really. They’re kind of just depicted as a weak organization apparently, where they get berated for everything. Even their “top notch” school seems pretty damn small and weak, compared to the scale of the organization that it should be at. It’s like...the heroes organization is on its back foot, even though it shouldn’t be. Where is all the security? If the school for talent is so important, why is there nothing guarding it? Where are the political and financial investments backings? Alright, that might be constraining to the plot, but what about just focusing on the organization itself? It doesn’t seem like a political entity, with no nuances involved at all, It’s just a convenient plot point that doesn’t get explained very well, despite its far reaching influences in the plot. I mean, just compare this with OPM. A parody show about heroes actually has unironically, a more realistic hero organization than Boku no hero. Is the hero organization in OPM anything special? No, but you clearly see the far reaching influences that it has, how rich it is, and exactly how special it really is. At the same note, it still retains its responsibility of protecting the populace, but at the same time, it showcases how it’s an immediately necessary entity that can’t be pushed around. 
Anyways, I could go on further, but those are the main points as to why I find Boku no Hero to be a disgrace",3,PixelB
31964,"
                Storyline was not as good as expected. It was initially extremely boring but later on got better as the episodes progressed. Towards the end, it became more gripping as it reached the climax.
I feel that this is good for young teenagers struggling to find a place in the world and is encouraging and motivating towards them. There is a constant message to be strong individuals and as the name suggests, be heroic and what heroism is actually about. It's uplifting and really positive, not necessarily realistic(because this is not under slice of life genre after all)
The humour throughout the series has made it interesting and
                  fun to watch.",7,holmeskudo
31964,"
                In a world where 80% of the population develop ""Quirks"" that allow them to use special superpowers, ""All men are not created equal"". Boku no Hero Academia follows Izuku Midoriya who is apart of the 20% without these ""Quirks"" but strives to become a hero like his idol, All Might, the world's Symbol of Peace and greatest hero. After an encounter with All Might, Izuku learns his secret and with All Might's help, enrolls in U. A. High School to become the hero he's always dreamed of being.
Boku no Hero Academia is Marvel/DC comics meets Naruto. Everything you see seems to come right out of
                  a comic book. It's exciting, action filled and incredibly interesting to watch. The superpowers are really cool to see and the conflicts are exhilarating. The characters and their powers are all unique and each one is very interesting to see. Though the anime does seem to focus more on the display of their powers rather than the characters themselves. There are a lot of characters to see but you only learn about a few of them. Also, the Villains are very vague in their presence and not much can be said about them. There is a second season on the way and hopefully it'll elaborate more on the characters.
There wasn't much of a story to be told. Nothing is too cliche or predictable but mostly the entire 13 episodes is about Izuku learning to be a hero. The most you can expect out the series is superpowers on display in a comic book feel, which is awesome to watch. Not much else can be said about this anime, I really enjoyed watching it and to me, that's all that matters. I can't wait for the next season.
Likes:
-I loved watching each super power used
-All Might's ""weak form"" made me laugh
-The characters are all incredibly intriguing and I would really like to learn more about them in the next season.
-The anime ended with sequel bait so I'm excited to see what enfolds in the next season.
Dislikes:
-It made me cringe every time Izuku would break his limbs",10,Caked_Bookies

                So My Hero Academia. Overall is a great anime. I mean one character has a greatly annoying voice, and in my opinion is completely useless. However lets get to the review. So weaknesses first here. The story is a rather simple one. Simple I want to be the best hero possible story. Not a bad one. One of my favorite types though. Like in Dragonball Z, One Piece, and all of the other shonen anime out there. However this is going to make the first season feel a bit slow. In the long run though it will be much better with each season. With this
                  type of story you have to have time for you to get to know the characters. So with that out of the way how are the characters? Well the first season doesn't show all of motivation for some of the characters. So some don't quite hook on to you. However the story isn't about the supporting characters. So the main characters motivation is pretty fantastic. They make sense, and they all have their weaknesses. They make pretty logical decisions as well. Now the art and sound. The art really takes well after the comic books, and does things the manga can not do. The art does a really good job on looking like a american comic book. Especially since the original author made this with a lot of influence from western comics, and movies. The fight scenes and movements are pretty fantastic. Then the sound is pretty fantastic too. Most of the characters have their own music to set there mood. It really amplifies the mood that the show is trying to show in their scenes. Then the voice acting is pretty good. Besides one stupid stereotypical dorky character. He complains a bit too much, and the voice is pretty bad as well. However the rest are really good choices too. It has some great new talent in the show as well. I am very happy to see how they do in other series. Then yah got some veteran voice actors as well. Overall the series is pretty good. I love my fighting series as well. So if you like that type of genre you will love this. It is also kind of refreshing hearing a good dub of a anime as well. Minus a slow story that I know will progress well, and the character that needs to shut up. I love this series. I would easily recommend this series.",8,SakaRaki

                Hey folks, this will be a review for Boku no Hero Academia. This show starts off a bit slow and somewhat frustrating. However after six episodes the show picks up and is really interesting.
The story revolves around a boy named Midoriya, Izuku. Midoriya is a quirk-less boy, who has always dreamed of being a hero. Quirks are basically superpowers, which in this world is more common than not having powers. As I mentioned above, the first six episodes revolve around Midoriya having trouble grasping his reality. Even though most Shounen shows have this to springboard into the story, this show lays it on rather thick
                  and makes it a bit harder to watch.
The later half of the show is rather fun to watch. Growth and a heroes reality are strongly prevalent. Its still a children's show, but it doesn't the hard line comic book approach of the good overpower the evil. The last 3 episodes were excellent and kept me interested.
The art was excellent. colorful, well detailed, strong body lines and in general the comic book feel to it. The soundtrack was alright. 
The characters are interesting. Of course all of them have an interesting power to learn. Even though the show focuses on Midoriya the other characters get some screen time. we don't know them as well as a show that spends all its time on characters but overall they were polished and interesting.
Midoriya is a young man with little power and big dreams. He embodies the character of the powerless young man who through hard work, and a good soul can overcome even life's greatest setbacks. However I couldn't help but hate him. His conversations, reactions, and what I only can guess is poorly done comic relief expressions were obnoxious. His friend Bakugou, Katsuki was also leaned more towards the annoying side of the meter.
Overall I enjoyed this anime. I look forward to the second season. I'm not sure how to describe what I liked the most about the show. It simply flows really well. The writers did an amazing job choosing personalities, settings, and ideas and putting them together in this story that really feels pleasant to watch. I would recommend this show to people who like superpowers. 
TLDR: Overall a great show. Shounen angle is a bit strong, comedy is weak, but would recommend anyway.",8,NSpectre7

                This is my first review but what I just wanted to say is, My hero academia is a great start on anime for the new anime fans because it’s overall a good anime.
I remember this being one of the first anime’s I got excited to continue watching and didn’t easily get bored of it.
Though some parts of the fandom can ruin the experience to some people, I would just suggest ignoring it and just continue enjoying the anime.
Watch it if you like good fighting scenes :)
And as an artist it gets the creative gears going with inspiration by just looking at the animation and art
                  style, there were many times I just looked at the animation and didn’t take in what actually happened in the story which made me have to watch it over again but it’s worth it!

Boku no Hero Academia, we follow a 15 years old boy named Midoriya who wants to achieves his dream of becoming a super hero. Hard you say? In this world having a super power is completely normal. In fact 80% of the population possess a ""quirk"". With this established, the world is similar to the ones found in comic books, where super vilain and super heroes exist. In this world, the profession of Super Hero is in demand. To achieve his dream, Midoriya

** SPOILER REVIEW **
STORY 
9/10
I can't give it a 10 because it's not finished yet but this story surprisingly holds its own. Let me explain. This anime manages to make the viewers wonder what other crazy battle or enemies the students and the teacher (aka super heroes) will face. My Hero Academia has a world where vilains are everywhere and heroes are needed! It is believable that if 80% of the population had a super power, there's bond to be some who aren't using it for good. 
ART
9/10
I'm not picky with art. As long as there's no obvious mistakes and that the animation is smooth I won't rate it below 9. The world is well drawn and pictured. I really like UA's campus. Uraraka is visually adorable and Todoroki is bad-ass. Visually all different and easy to spot. 
SOUND
10/10
I'm a sucker for this kind of music. It's soooo catchy. I'm already singing the intro. The atmosphere is well put throughout the anime, there's no long silences. Again, I'm not super picky but I like my background music. 
CHARACTER
10/10
I'm in love with these characters, honestly they're so fun and unique! (Season 2 also helps here) Midoriya is not my favorite but his character is your typical dream boy who won't give up and I dig it. I'm a big fan of  ASui (sue) character and Iida. There's obviously a great dynamic being build here and I can't wait to see them grow. Bakugo is definitely my favorite, at first I was scared he was going to turn bad but I love how they made him heroic in his own sadistic way.

                It's a bit difficult to say why this anime is so good and why it has a lot of potential.  It has every single cliche you can think of--You will predict every single event that this anime will present.  There are no plot twists. BUT what makes it different from the rest is that it has heart.  An emotional touch.
That and it is paired up with an amazing studio, Studio Bones.  I actually think is is some of their best work, too.  They understood how to make this show come alive through their beautiful animation and perfect OST.  I
                  actually read the manga before the anime premiered and I wasn't too impressed by it.  I only started loving it after EP 5 of the anime.
Now I really miss this show and I'm holding back everything in order not to continue in the manga.  I believe BONES could do a better job showing off the best two(?) arcs coming up according to fans.  
Whether this show lives up to be the next big thing, I have yet to see that but for now, this was my favorite anime this spring and I'll DEFINITELY tune in when s2 comes out.   I have hopes for this one and if this season didn't convince people that it's anything special, I hope it'll convince everyone next season.",9,xxxSmileAgain

The story is about superheroes and villains. The hero always wins and the villains always loses, it is very predictable. While many viewers categorize this as a childish anime (to be fair it is targeted for younger audience), however I do think the storyline and world building is pretty well done.
Art 8/10
The artstyle of the characters are a bit cartoonish-like. Surprisingly it is not that bad
                  and I really like the design of Ochako, she is so damn cute (props to her seiyu Sakura Ayane).
Sound 9/10
MHA did a really good job in this. The OST of this anime might not be my most favourite but it definitely made the series much more enjoyable.
Character 10/10
There are like a hundred characters in this series (maybe I exaggerated) but all of them are so well-written. I am most impressed by the strong and solid female characters, Ochako might be best girl for me but the other 5 are also very likeable and doesn't feel like extras.
Enjoyment 10/10
I instantly got hooked when I first watch this anime. Not because there are cliffhangers or plot twist, but because I want to get to know more about the characters and world building. Definitely worth a rewatch too.
Overall 9/10
It is a great show that I will recommend to other people. The simplicity of this show is what makes it good.",9,Bernardyuankun

                Boku no Hero Academia: 7.6/10 (I’m not rounding up for this shit)
My Hero Academia.. A Tale of a boy with no quirk (the dumbest name for a power). Oh, MHA. To its infamous fanbase, to the crybaby known as “Deku”. But yknow, it ain’t half bad.
STORY 7/10: The story is pure Shounen, a boy is born into a world with powers known as quirks and wants to be a pro hero. BUT BUT BUT! This little crybaby HAS NO QUIRK D: . And from this becomes a stan of most heroes and a straight up stalker to his fellow classmates taking notes and analyzing them.
                  All of this for his dream of being a hero… But then it all changes.. He meets All Might due to some events and is blessed with the opportunity to gain All Might’s ‘All For One’ power. Yeah, badass. If that doesn’t scream basic Shounen then idk what Shounen is. Outside of that the action is pretty good, pacing is fast and sweet, and entertaining at most times. The downsides in the story mostly comes from the childish nature of the show, but the show is mostly targeted towards pre-teen to younger teens so can’t bash too much there. 
ART 7.5/10: The art is really good for the most part. Not much to say. The character design is nice and unique also. 
SOUND 8/10: The OP’s fit the show very well, and the OST’s are pretty good for the most part. ‘The Day’ is definitely the best OP, didn’t skip it once. 
CHARACTERS 6.5/10: Oh, the characters.. Well.. Not everything is perfect? The characters are pretty shallow and one dimensional, and pretty damn childish. Bakugo and Deku TWO OF THE MOST DAMN IMPORTANT CHARACTERS IN THIS SHOW are annoying as hell. Deku always cries and even after gaining ‘All For One’ is still a weak character who is for the most part useless. And the show wants you to feel bad for em but it goes too far, and he ends up just being a nuisance. And Bakugo, ugh.. Man is like a bully NPC. Like your run of the mill bully from grade school. Nothing much else to say on the characters. They are all just average. But All Might can Detroit Smash me anytime he wants <3.
ENJOYMENT 9/10: Even if half of the cast has their list of shortcomings, I loved watching the show. It felt refreshing to get something so basic and entertaining. The action and fast pacing really help in this area also due to my monkey-brain not being able to handle long drawn out digoulge. It’s almost the same for Black Clover for me, the show can be so dumb its entertaining. 
OVERALL 7 + 7.5 + 8 + 6.5 + 9 = 38 38/5 = 7.6: MHA is just a casual fun show you watch after watching some messed up shit like Monster or Hellsing Ultimate. It definitely has its list of shortcomings, but doesn’t take away from the fact that the show is just a fun watch.",7,SashaFan22225

Enjoyment 10
At first I was very skeptical when I decided to watch the show since I don't really watch action shows, but this feel-good underdog story has captivated me. It is certainly a great action anime, but it also ""goes beyond plus ultra"". There are great characters that really portrays depth and diversity on what it means to be a hero. The synopsis might seem stereotypical, but this anime has delivered it in a way that refines the hero tropes without making them too cheesy. There are many endearing moments, hilarious moments, and thrilling moments packed in each episode. Although there are many shows out
                  there with alluring antagonists or antiheroes, this show truly makes you cheer for the heroes. This season is definitely a great origin story and it gave delightful hints of a larger world with great problems without forgetting about the story at hand. From the very first scene to the last, this show is truly entertaining.",10,purplelife

                Boku no hero academia has some low maturity if you're interested in a mature anime. But the fascinating story and the fun characters makes up for it. The story(not going to spoil that much) has an awesome concept basically saying that most of the population in the world has now superpowers and has now become a normal thing. The interesting part is that we are taken along with the story of a teenager who has no superpowers or quirks(as referred in the anime) and see him trying to become a hero. The story as goes with him, takes a massive twist changing his life(in a
                  good way) but not his good ideology of ""what a hero is and should do"" which is sort of shown as a property not many heros have in the anime(I guess) due to which this massive twist occurred. The anime goes on showing Izuku(the teenager) with his going to a hero school(as the title ""academia"" suggests) to become a hero(now due to that ""twist"", the world's no.1 hero).This anime goes on with Izuku's sense of heroism to shine.The ideology of hero(not only of Izuku's but others too)is reflected a lot in this anime. There is so much to the story I haven't told,or it will get spoilt. As a superhero anime, it has some cool action scenes and overall, a story of determination and heroism(also has some funny scenes).",7,crumie

                [REVIEW WITHOUT SPOILERS]
Oh boy, hard to do a review without spoilers of this beautiful anime. Because it's for some specific points that this show reaches greatness. Anyway, let's try:
** THE VERY GOOD POINTS:
* STORY: 8
The story is very good, as it mixes classic combat situation with school/training. It may not be so original, but frankly, where are the original stories nowadays? Storylines are good, there is thought and strategy, and from the first moment you are hooked in, and want to know what happens next.
* ART: 9
The art is very nice and enjoyable, plus it makes a great effort to strike what is the essential
                  factor of this anime: diversity of characters. In particular, one character, the real jewel of the show...
* SOUND: 9
The soundtrack is very nice, always on spot, catchy, and perfectly suits the story moments.
** THE OUTSTANDING POINTS:
* CHARACTERS and ENJOYMENT: 10
Really, this is an anime about character, spirit, feelings and emotions. Don't think you are going to find the classic ""hero"" traits here, because what makes this series so special, and intriguing, is how it redefines the same concept of hero. Which is not an easy and straightforward concept. What is a hero? That's the constant mantra of this anime, and the greatness is in how this question is answered. Because the truth is that it's not so easy at all, to define what a hero is. And as soon as the show progresses, many answers are given, and also many new questions come up.
On top of this, the enjoyment factor. Because yes, we can split votes into story music art and so on, but what really matters in an anime is: how much does it catch you? How much do you feel involved? How much do you ENJOY it? This show catches the emotions of the viewer, and never let them go. It is just pure enjoyment from start to end, touching your inner feelings, making you think, laugh, enjoy, question, participate.
Summing up, this is a top-class anime, well worth staying in the classics of animation. Watch it and just let it go, let it touch you deep inside, and above all, let it find the true hero within you.",10,AnimationPower

                I watched 63 episodes in three days. That could be my entire review because otherwise this will be a novel. I have written so few reviews but I could not help myself. I haven't cried from an anime in a very long time, and I was not expecting to cry during this one.
WARNING *Slight spoilers ahead*
Story 10/10
The story starts in a society where 80% of the population have quirks (super powers). Our protagonist, Deku, however, has none; but he vows to be a hero. We do not get the run of the mill story where weak boy becomes strong because plot - looking at you
                  naruto even though I adore you. It Is well crafted and well delivered while keeping high emotion and high anticipation - with some kickass moves.
Art 10/10
The movements, the character art. SO MUCH CHARACTER ART. You can't always tell if a character will be a main character, a side character, or just a passing conversation. It isn't like some anime where the main gets the cool hair, detailed design - EVERYONE looks different. It takes a lot of time to make each character with different augmentations, body types, and powers to make each scene look fluid and captivating. 
Sound 10/10
I don't know much about sound, but if I can think of absolutely nothing to complain about, then I have to give it a 10. AND THAT INTRO MUSIC AMIRITE?
Character 10/10
This has some of the best character development in any anime I've seen. And not just for the main character - ALL characters. Each person is given a time to show how they've grown, and just how far every single person is growing. Deku especially, since he is a genuine cry baby, and learns to actually use his quirk and train himself to not just rush in with no plan. Relationships constantly are growing, and no one seems 2D or bland.
Enjoyment 10/10
I. watched. 63. episodes. in. 3. days. NEXT
Overall 10/10
I think it speaks for itself. Sure, the first few episodes can be slow since so many people are being introduced, but it's not just a barrage of introductions. Each person being crafted and shown has a purpose that will carry through the anime and I honestly cannot praise this enough. 
Special thanks to my friend Katie for recommending this and dragging me into the abyss. xoxo",10,amykinsxoxo

                Story: 7/10. If you ever watched the movie Sky-High, then you basically get the premise of MHA. 
- World where people have special powers and can be real-life superheroes? Check.
- Main character who lacks special powers despite wanting to be a hero? Check.
- Really obnoxious 'rival' who hates the main character and has the power to blow up stuff? Check.
The plot of this show is fundamentally simple, and I think that works both as a strength and as a vice. Because of the simplicity, you aren't hung up on convoluted details; for a battle shounen, this works fantastically because the show becomes fast-paced, engaging and
                  dynamic. However, due to this we don't really feel much connection to the characters and aren't necessarily attached to the stories of the current arcs. After watching the show twice, nothing really stood out to me besides the fights and 'epic moments'; the character interactions are pretty forgettable in this season. 
Art: 10/10. Really great, not much to be said here. Bones knows what they're doing.
Sound: 9/10. Love the soundtrack.
Character: 6/10. Pretty simplistic, which isn't a bad thing but isn't necessarily great either. Most character motivations are pretty one-dimensional. We don't really see any growth from anyone, but given this is Season 1 and there are multiple seasons of this show, it's to be expected.
All Might is a 10/10 though.
Enjoyment: 9/10. I had a blast watching this show, and I think it's an easy one for people to get into: whether you're a hard core anime fan or something who just wants to watch something for fun. 
Overall: 8/10. MHA is one of the few shows that finds strength in simplicity. It's cliched, somewhat generic and not particularly revolutionary, but it executes its story in an entertaining way and keeps you wanting to see more.",8,Kuta1

""Oh my... OH MY GOODNESS!"" -All Might
How entertaining it was: 10/10. The only score that matters.
This show has been such an emotional and hilarious ride for me. Going into this series, I never thought I will like a wimpy crybaby protagonist so much. 
In fact, after watching the first episode, I was thinking about dropping the show because the main
                  character seemed so pathetic. I thought it was going to be a shitty knock-off of One-punch man. 
BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!
The protagonist is very smart, only wimpy because he is initially powerless.
This is a story of how he came a strong hero!
Right off the second episode, the series hit me with feel train. I laughed. I teared up. I became hooked. I went on to watched the whole series and jumped right into the manga. 
For a shonen genre show, this series features a very mature atmosphere, showing us the harsh reality of life. And yet somehow, the show makes it so funny, emotional, and action packed with its masterful story progression, narration, very well developed characters, the animation, and the music. It really knows how to hype people up, similar to what Haikyuu is known for.
Oh my god. Do not get me started on the music. I can easily write a page about how perfectly fitting and ear-gasmic it is. But you would be bored of reading by then. It contributed so much to the viewing experience, enhancing the feels and emotions in the series.
Season 2 is currently airing, and the manga is very good (ranked top 10 on MangaTown). 
Try the first 3 episodes. If you're in for a emotional yet funny action shonen geared towards both the young and mature, I guarantee you would enjoy Boku no Hero Academia.",10,AvariciousOne

                Contains spoilers (not super-specific ones, but general, non-specific parts of the story)
Originality is often overrated. It can be mind-blowing, groundbreaking, and even thought-provoking when it's done well, but I've seen many anime (or works in any creative medium for that matter) that present an interesting premise only to become something dull and unengaging because the execution and/or development of the unique ideas was poor. A super unique and original show simply cannot be good or better without high quality execution of its ideas, story, and concepts. My Hero Academia, however, is proof that standard fare can be very enjoyable and pretty damn good when it's
                  well-executed.
Story: 6/10-Good
It's hard to imagine a much more conventional set-up for a superhero story than the one My Hero Academia presents us. To keep the summary brief and spoilers minimal, I'll just say that we have a down-on-his-luck MC who fatefully ends up receiving some mentoring from a famous hero whom he's idolized since childhood, works/trains hard, makes some friends, and makes some notable contributions to the final confrontation (of season 1) with some villains. It's a pretty typical story, but it's well-told and I was consistently engaged throughout the show's run-time. There are some good, entertaining battles to be seen in MHA that develop the characters further as well.
Animation: 7.5/10-Great
The animation fits the show's tone and superhero theme perfectly. I haven't read the manga (yet) but from the images I've seen from it, it looks like the animators' intentions was to maintain the comic book aesthetic and they did a great job.
Sound: 8.5/10-Excellent
The value of an excellent soundtrack (and OP/ED) in an anime is often understated. My Hero Academia's OP was awesome and consistently got me hyped to watch each episode. The ED is pretty good as well and the OST is well-utilized in keeping the viewer engaged in the action and story of MHA.
Characters: 8/10-Excellent
It's hard not to like these characters. There's a good mix of powers and personalities to be found in the bunch and it helps keep the show really entertaining. Anyone who enjoys the show is sure to find one or more characters that they really like. Character development doesn't occur in the most unique ways, but it's enjoyable seeing everyone mature and grow stronger together, and that's what these types of shows (shounen/superheroes) are all about. I personally like Uraraka and All Might the best.
Enjoyment: 8/10-Excellent
Overall: 7.5/10-Great
I've only seen season 1 and while I wouldn't put My Hero Academia among my absolute favorites at this time, I really liked it and I definitely plan on watching seasons 2 and 3. If you like shounen, action, or superhero anime, I can strongly recommend that you watch My Hero Academia. If you're in the mood for something really different and unconventional, you may want to skip it for now though. If you're neutral about both of my previous statements, I'd say you should still give it a try as it's a great show in my opinion. The action, story, and characters are sure to hold most viewers' attention and keep them entertained. My Hero Academia strives to tell an enjoyable, good ol' fashioned superhero story and it does just that.",7,MorningStorm64

                People have given very long winded reviews about this Anime, but I'm going to be real, and I'm going to make this short and simple. 
If you are looking for an incredibly deep and complex storyline.... this isnt for you. If you're having a bad day and want some cheering up, this is where you go. 
The storyline, whilst simple, is obviously supposed to make people feel good. Obviously we are supposed to start off feeling sorry for Izuku aka 'Deku' because he's Quirkless, a part of the minority. However, he gets noticed by his all time hero, and he inherits an amazing super power,
                  goes to the school he's always dreamed to go to, and starts on a journey to become a superhero himself. Basically, he gets what he wants. 
The characters are also quite sweet. The Pro Heroes are OTT probably on purpose, and the students are all slotted into quite obvious archetypes that just makes them stand out. Once again it's basic, but the personality and designs of these characters just seem to make them kind of likable.",8,GermanPotato

                Story: The story is not new and yet it is very refreshing. I found myself empathizing so much with little Midoriya. This anime truly is a roller coaster and just cannot get enough! Me and my friends have enjoyed just chilling and watching this anime and laughing at the comedic scenes and cheering on the fighting scenes. Gave me Naruto flashbacks. We used to all hang out and order pizza and scream for whoever we wanted to win! I am so glad that this tradition is staying. This story keeps you on the edge of your seat man. 
Art: BEAUTIFUL!
Sound: Very nice! I liked the
                  music and I LOVE the voice acting in both Japanese AND English which is rare because I am so picky. They really did a good job in voicing these characters!
Character: I do not want to spoil these amazing characters but please watch to see for yourself how unique and interesting these characters are :D
Enjoyment: 10/10 all the way. 
Overall: I will always recommend this awesome anime! This is such an inspiring anime that just really speaks to me. I feel like there are many lessons to learn from this anime, for sure.",10,Sasunaru4life

                This anime is as good as people say it it - at least, if you enjoy this kind of anime. I do recommend people to watch this, but honestly if you're more into deep, gruesome and mature kind of anime, then skip this one. What are you even planning on watching a shounen anime if you don't like the genre? Because this anime is meant for people who enjoy this 'kid' like action-comedy about superheroes. 
The story of this first season is short; it's like what, not even a year long? But it is quite important build up for the future seasons. While most animes
                  might take the first few episodes to introduce the characters, the main plot of the story, etc, Boku no Hero Academia take the first season - which is actually a good thing. Things aren't rushed - though I haven't read the manga yet so they might have left some things out which honestly shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. 
I don't have that much to say about the art; it's good - obviously not the best, but certainly not bad - it's actually quite perfect for a superhero anime.",8,maggiic
31964,"
                GENERAL - Boku no Hero Academia takes a new route on the shounen series. Each shounen series tends to have its own  sort of ""main type of power"" (Wizards, Pirates, Ninjas, Hunters etc.).  In this series  it takes n super hero's.
These hero's have quirks which act as there super powers. These powers can range form simple things to help with an every day task, to the more powerful ones that let them become hero's. These quirks are first seen at a yong age so if there is no quirk then it is likely they flal in to the small percent that will
                  not have a quirk. This is where we follow our main lead Midoriya, he falls into this small category and has always dreamed that he will one day becoem a hero. With him having no quirk we see him struggle still holdign on to the hope he can be a hero without any quirk. Suddenly he has a quirk and is set to apply for  a hero academy.  This is where Boku no Hero Academia all begins.
Now this season of the series acts as teaser of sorts. With its 13 episodes count we don't get much timme to see our characters grow and not too much world building. As this is a problem with the episode amount and not the series itself I can't take anything away from it.
So we see the students  grow  and learn how to use there powers to there full effect. These can range from small tasks to team based games to show the different situations they might run into as a hero.
CHARACTERS - So as stated we don't really get much time to developing our characters in the first season here. But our stand out characters are  Midoriya, Bakugou, All Might and  Uraraka.
Midoriya  is our main male lead and acts as the series protagonist. He is a character that you could relate to. he has a nice personality and it is fun to see him grow as a character.
Bakugou acts as our rival of sorts. he seems to not want Midoriya to get into the shcool to start with and is angry when he finds out he did get in. We get a fair bit of development for him and will be interesting to see where his character goes form this point forward.
All Might in the person Midoriya looks up to. He is widely known to be one of the best or THE best hero.  His character in a lot of ways is kind of what you would expect from a famous super hero. Also most notable is the character design with the dark shading and edges to him to give a feel of what you might see in a comic book.
Uraraka acts as our main female character. We don't get to see tooo much of her in this first season but has potential to grow as a great character.
SOUND - So the sound is pretty great. It is nice and  fits the super hero theme fairly well.
ART / ANIMATION - So the animation is reallly nice with only 13 episodes they can put a greater focus on the animation.  With a long running shounen series the animation uslally isn't up to par at all times since its being made every week. This is one of the benefits of the short episode count.
OVERALL -So over all the show is fun to watch. It just would've been better  to get more episodes to get a better idea of the characters and this universe. That being said a Season 2 is coming up so it iwll be interesting to see where it goes from here. The show does a nice job of kicking off the series and is nice to see this new take on the shounen genre.

                Wouldn't it be awesome if we had super powers?
Boku no Hero Academia presents a world in which at some point 80% of the population developed what would be called ""Quirks"" -- special abilities that often have effects on the person's physical appearance. As such, Quirks play a large role in contemporary life, with heroes being in demand to combat villains, take care of city problems, etc.
Of course, with Quirks manifesting at around age four, educating future generations of heroes is in order; thus we have schools for heroics such as the one featured, U.A. High, which also happens to be the best Hero Academy in
                  the world.
Enter protagonist Izuku Midoriya. Born without a Quirk, he grew up doting on notable heroes, taking meticulous notes on their various abilities and characteristics. He dreams of becoming a hero, but without a Quirk it seems impossible but the #1 hero, All Might, bestows upon him his own Quirk, and the path to glory begins.
However... unlike that of prominent shounen protagonists such as Luffy, Naruto, Ichigo, etc., the journey to becoming stronger for Midoriya is rife with failure. Midoriya is a weak crybaby who does triumph throughout the anime, but does so often due to extraordinary luck and/or help from those around him.
But he always gets back up, even when he is in pain -- always keeping his idol, All Might, in his mind's eye, and never swaying from his goal of becoming a hero. Even when he's scared for his life, he still runs forward. Even when he's far behind, he finds a way to push forward. All that note-taking pays off when Midoriya compensates for his lack of agility or Quirk control by making use of the situation to succeed. Watching Midoriya clench his teeth through his tears and not back down, I am touched. The protagonists of the Big Three I named earlier, yes, there are times when they don't win -- but for those three, the plot armor is just too thick. Whenever Luffy, Naruto or Ichigo faces an enemy, you pretty much know who's going to win. But for Midoriya, the opposite often occurs. Academia presents a more realistic approach to the shounen genre, a story in which the main character loses a lot and is still struggling.
Like its rival, One Punch Man, Academia thus puts a spin on what too many shounen have been doing in the past 20 years. Whereas One Punch Man's Saitama wins too much and deplores the lack of strong opponents, Academia's Midoriya wins little, but gets back up and keeps fighting for his dream to become a hero. Like One Punch Man, although its first season consists of only 1 cour, the manga is ongoing and based on what's happened so far the entire story is quite ambitious and has the potential to run for quite some time. In terms of the quality of the animation/fights and enjoyment, I found One Punch Man better, but Academia has a way cooler soundtrack and more realistic and human-like characters
wait did I just say soundtrack? Boku no Hero Academia has one of the most unique and best soundtracks I've ever heard. Its invigorating, upbeat feel matches the hero motif perfectly. (In case you didn't know, the composer also scored Haikyuu!!.) It's one of those rare anime whose soundtrack is so good that it alone can make you want to keep watching. Usually the music kind of fades into the background since you're focusing more on what's happening, but watching Academia the music comes into aural focus a bit more and... like damn, it's good. ""You can be a hero."" The feels... Usually I don't say too much about the soundtrack because, like the animation, it's secondary to the plot and characters, but this is a different case. Even if the story weren't about high school students training to become pro heroes and using various cool abilities and a weakling protagonist is thrown in and he just wants to become a hero and so many thanks to All Might for choosing him, Academia also had to have a superb soundtrack. Okay, enough said. I just mentioned ""more realistic and human-like characters.""
Given the number of episodes released so far, I believe the mangaka did well with his characters. They're not too flat like many anime characters nowadays. Reading the manga beyond what has occurred so far in season 2, I appreciate Kohei Horikoshi's efforts to develop his characters. They feel like real people (albeit with Quirks), which is good.
Now back to Midoriya. What does it mean to be a hero?
Watch Boku no Hero Academia to find out.

                this anime changed my mind, i always thought it is impossible to sympathize with highly optimistic main male character, 
but my hero academia showed how fucking bad other anime’s MCs are.
Midoriya (the Main Character) is extremely optimistic but seeing his “real” struggle to achieve his goals makes you respect his will power
the only problem i have with this anime is the ending and development of a certain individual,
there is a real jerk in this anime (Katsuki Bakugo), he sees Midoriya as worthless, this guy has all the qualities a villain has, he is crual, he is kinda insane, he is narcissistic, he has a huge
                  ego. Midoriya in this anime starts to improve himself, he is getting stronger and Katsuki can’t accept the possibility of being  weaker than Midoriya.
this should have been the plot, Katsuki should have turned into the main antagonist, it would have been symbolic, Katsuki would symbolized all the people who are doing their best to keep Midoriya (us) down, his hatred for Midoriya would have create an interesting tension, there is no reason to keep this guy as hero.
and villians aren't that interesting or a threat to heroes with the exception of a brain-dead zombie called Nomu.

                Boku no Hero Academia is one of the anime of all time. Hopelessly shounen, and hopelessly mediocre. With not much to review, 5's across the board is fitting.
Since it seems I have to make this review longer, it is with immeasurable disappointment that I am forced to go slightly more in-depth. From what I can recall with clarity, BNHA remains undefeated in its simplistic story. A young boy, befitting of the 'shounen' title, is powerless in a 'quirk'(superpower)-dominated society. With irredeemably 2-dimensional characters ever-present through the entire thing, something like plot twists! or rather anything unexpected of generic shounen, chiefly character development (depth especially) and
                  world-building, is left out. Personally, this show is extremely undeserving of its - in my eyes - high rating. That is not to say that it does not meet the requirements of its target audience. Instead of the highly critical, it is marketed to the general masses that is the young and the innocent. Be that as it may, whatever it does is still just the bare minimum. With that, my review is concluded.",5,Faallacy

                Now we all love a good superhero movie and most of the good ones are origin stories, so this whole anime should be a good one considering how it is an origin story for the main character.
Like many shounen animes, the main character is on a journey to become the greatest at what he does, he seems rather unimpressive but it's kept interesting by his very nerdy side, all the speculation he has around heroes and their powers is the same as any comic fans would be. I would know, I am one. On a different note, he looks very submissive. I'd love to push
                  his face down into a pillow and whisper into his ear that when I'm done with him, he'll not be able to walk.
The fighting isn't what got me stuck, but the realisation that the characters wich seem so playful at first, with one noticeable exception, will need to learn the real truth about the world they live in, heroes don't always win and even if they do, it's not always a pretty sight.
Not that the fighting isn't good. One thing I really liked about One Piece was that they really could go anywhere with the fight scenes with the somewhat infinite possibilities of Devilfruits, this has that same element but better. Might be since they aren't handicapped as in the One Piece anime or because they are more varied since so many got these powers.
All in all, this anime like a special someone packs a punch, I haven't seen too many animes where fighting is central and still produces a big world and a story I'm interested in. Watch it, like it and try not to wear too much spandex afterwards.",9,SirMarmelady

                (Please Note: I am not hating on this series or saying the anime is bad. I'm just stating my honest opinion on this show. So please, don't be offended or hate on the review.)
Season one of My Hero Academia is a decent start of an anime series, but nothing too special. While I admit this anime is great and I have nothing against it, the beginning is a little bland. While it is good, I think it could have been done better. However I love the story and do think it is good. I also love the characters and think the humor is on point.
                  The second half of the season is really good and I think it makes up for the beginning of the series. Even sooo...... Sorry MHA season numero uno, you only get a 7, for anime waifus are lit!

                So I'm usually not hopping on many shounen trains. I didn't want to dedicate the time to Naruto, and after I had the end of Bleach somewhat spoiled I felt strongly that I wouldn't get the payoff I was hoping for at the end. There are occasional ones like Hunter x Hunter and Kaguya (kinda seinen but it's in Young Jump). Despite all this BNHA managed to take my entire week away while I caught up on all three seasons. In this review I'll go into just season one, and say that it's definitely worth your time.
Story: Oddly enough, the story was the weakest part
                  for me. I mean that insofar as the overall narrative is kinda all over the place. One moment you're not supposed to copy someone, the next you are; there's no real developed theme of how characters should develop besides ""Eh we'll deal with it at the time"". This can kinda get hectic when you see someone really develop a power and then they're like ""Alright, but now never do that again"". This isn't a huge issue, due to the amount of smaller arcs that the show pulls off very well and decisively. This makes it satisfying to see the end, but sometimes I found myself dragging in the middle of each arc.
Art and Sound: The style is just fantastic, I love the colors, the sounds, the effects. Each character (regardless of personality) looks distinct and distinguishable from the rest. The animation of each of these abilities is easily discernible as well. I did notice some background CGI for crowds in the distance occasionally, however it was only when my eyes would drift from what I was supposed to be focused on. The ""color coding"" of each hero really brings out the feeling of them being ""super heros"" in a very comic-like style that I really appreciate.
Character: Honestly I think the characterization of these kids is the best part of the show. The way Deku and others advance, and all try to do their best is something I did not expect coming into this show. I expected so much focus on Deku with some side plots, however the show seems to care about each character introduced in some way or another.
Overall and Enjoyment: This show is just like popcorn. It's not really something that might be satisfying until you eat a lot of it, so you'll just sit down and eat three entire bags until you're finished. This isn't a slap on the show either. I really enjoyed the time I invested to the point where I couldn't stop. If you want something to fill that void of shows that are only getting 2 seasons then stopping so you can go read the source material, you should definitely check this out.",7,AmericanSomnium

                I don't know why, but I cry every time I watch this.  Even though I've already watched it and know whats going to happen next.  It's that good!  Second season gets exponentially better too.  
This show is not the number one standing anime television series of all time for no reason.  It is loved and adorned by many.  I hate shows with too much fan service (which is every show I see now.  Lots of tits and ass in every movie or television show because caveman love stupid stuff to see.  BONER!).  I'd like to think
                  that I'm above all that immature stupidity, but a tiny tiny tiny tiny amount of fan service is totally fine.  For example, I don't want all the woman in my television shows to be devoid of sex appeal and I don't want all the characters to completely ignore that sex appeal.  However, in real life, people don't just straight up rape women.  I just want it closer to normal.  I think you get my point, and the only reason i wrong this second paragraph is cause the system will not allow a short review.",10,charliechuckle

                It is one of my favorite, why you ask, because it portrays something that has been missing in a lot of superhero anime recently: The hard work and continuous training it takes to reach the top.
The story revolves around Midoriya (our protagonist) who receives power from the world’s best superhero. But don’t get mistaken, that is just the starting. What follows is one of the best story about the hard work and choices he has to make on his way to reach the top. On top of that, adding amazing action sequences to the mix really packs a punch for all the action, superhero genre

                Probably, Boku no Hero Academia is my first Shōnen anime I've ever watched.
I can say already the story isn't the best but I've gave it a 10 because it was uplifting and I needed that kind of story (and I'm biased, like everyone else).
The art was actually were well animated and it reminded me a lot of American comic books were this anime and manga took it's inspiration from.
The sound was top notch and the music pumping but nothing special in particular.
The characters were diverse, actually funny and had pretty different quirks, which is to be expected. I liked that even All Might was not
                  truly OP and everything had a logic behind it.
I enjoyed this show more than I thought I would, I'm pumped to see the second season and if they can improve i in any way.

                I haven't seen much shounen anime. I watched bits and pieces of Naruto and Dragon Ball Z so this is my first shounen anime I actually sat through and watched the whole way through. I was a little leery of it since I heard it's a superhero anime that's based on Marvels and DC Comics and I was never much of a fan of their movies but I was surprised that I actually found this anime quite enjoyable. That made me think that maybe I don't like watching superhero films because the theater makes them loud and all that and I am sensitive to loud
                  sounds, I thought it was also the speed of them. It's weird though because I like action stuff.
I can't compare this to other shounen anime since I haven't seen much of them yet. The story is immersive and creative. It made me wish that we lived in a world full of quirks. It showed the great intensity of trying to become a hero, well-written in a way that most superhero movies don't do.
The characters all were distinct with unique personalities and abilities. All-Might was compelling and strong with a charming, likeable personality. Aizawa is an attractive, cool teacher even if he can be too strict. Ochako is a bit too polite but I still think she is a great character mainly because of her cheerful, amiable attitude and also she FLIES. Asui can say things that may offend people but she's also sensible enough to not be annoying with it. The only ones I didn't like were Izuku (wipe your snot, Izuku) and Mineta, who were crybabies but also in the case of Mineta, perverted. Izuka is not as bad as Mineta, he's just mediocre but what I liked about him is that he's cute and badass. Oh, I almost forgot Katsuki is another character I don't like because I don't like overconfident hot-headed characters and he was such a bully to poor Izuka.
The art is a little simplistic and nothing to write home about, the animation however is charming. It's one of the anime that has a really good dub, the actors were charming, funny and brought fresh life to their characters. I love its goofy comedy and its exciting action. The anime is a bit derivative and not completely groundbreaking but it executes most of its tropes creatively.",7,Angry_Anime_Nerd

1/2 My opinion
Animation = 10/10 The character details and varieties are amazing. The colors are sharp and the animations
are really great
Story/concept = 8/10 The world has changed. And there know exists heros and villains with unknown powers.
Buildup = 9/10 It starts off with little doku powerless and bullied, but he still wants to become a hero no matter what. And he does whatever it takes to get there.
Voice acting = 9/10 I found it hard to find different kinds of voice acts like English. But the Japanese version was really great.
Music = 8/10 The intro music ""The Day"" by Porno Graffitti is really a good intro song that suits the intro really great. But there isn't a lot of music which could be amazing. Imagine an epic scene where they play The Day where Doku just shows his colors in an epic fight scene against the villains. 
Personal feelings = 9/10 I found this season really enjoying and it's worth watching if you are a fan of Shonen.

                My opinion is rather mixed. My Hero Academia is a cliché storm of a shonen and most of what I've seen in it felt like deja-vu, so the first half of season 1 was pretty boring. But to be honest it isn't bad, I don't have any ""X is shit"" comment about it. I think if I watched it 10+ years ago when I was younger and had watched less anime, I would have adored it because the whole cliché things would have felt new to me. Basically I think for people new to anime (not just younger audiences) it should be great, but was
                  kinda bland to me.
It gets better in the second half of season 1 (USJ arc) though so I think it was a good thing that I continued watching.
The art style and animation and music (including OP/ED songs) are great so that's a plus. All Might is a very particular and original character and I've liked him a lot. Izuku/Deku/Midoriya (main character) was kind of annoying at first because he was whiny although it is kind of justified in context.
Bakugo (the rival) was kind of crappy and lame because he was so unlikable and a cliché bully but he gets a bit better over time so he's not a lost cause. Basically I think he's supposed to be the more violent aggressive hero but he comes off as very arrogant and sometime borderline psychopathic.
The only shit part that I really didn't like and would wish out of existence is the rat bitch (I don't know his name). He has no redeeming qualities, no heroism and no composure, panics at the slightest hint of danger and is useless in any situation. Worst part is that he's a creep that physically abuse his female classmates by touching their butts and boobs. I found him incredibly creepy and disgusting and unnecessary and he made me uncomfortable. Having a character wear a sexually revealing costume is ok for fanservice, a somewhat lovable perv too but a damn creep is not. Also his power is throwing his hair which is shaped like balls and they're sticky. All of these combined made me question why he was even there, in UA the most prestigious school and A-1 the best class of the school? And the teacher said he once expelled an entire class because they lacked potential? He also had better scores than Deku in physical tests despite having a useless quirk and being a chubby midget? How is he not getting expelled? Just so he can sexually harass his classmates? Get out of here :/",7,Rinar

                Shonen genre has always either received a lot of love or hate, which ever camp you belong to this is an anime which will resonate well with everyone alike.
STORY:
First season introduces us to Deku, All Might, and majority of the students of class 1-A. Though it majorly focuses mostly on deku and All Might. The story might feel like a cliche shonen story where the MC dreams to become the strongest in the world or like his role model(here it’s “All Might”) but that is where all the cliches end, the way character motivations and the overall plot are handled is refreshing while still maintaining
                  all the major parts which have made this genre so popular.
Bones has nailed the pacing, I haven’t read the manga but from what I’ve heard it is a very faithful adaptation of the manga.
ART:
If you look up the character designs for the manga and compare it to the anime designs you’ll be hard pressed to find any difference. Though it is very different from your generic designs and might require to get used to it but once you get used to it you’ll fall in love with them.
Animation is top notch as expected by Bones. I haven’t noticed any drops in the animation, but there might be a few if you go looking for it with a magnifying glass.
SOUND:
OP and ED are very good and memorable, especially the ED.
The thing which stood out the most in the sound department is the OST. Apart from being epic on its own, the OST was utilised well giving those epic chill down the spine moments. Though it is overused, I prefer quality over quantity.
CHARACTER:
It is this department which kinda felt lacking (at least for the first season) as we are introduced to multitude of charcters but the story focused only on deku, All Might and a little of Bakugō. This is kinda expected with limited 13 episode run, but what we got is more than enough, the character motivations and development were handled really well. 
The characters are the main USP for this show and the story handles them with respect. Every character introduced has a motive and required for the advancement of the plot without them being there for the sake of it. 
ENJOYMENT:
I don’t mind incomplete ending as long as the journey to this end is very enjoyable, if the ending is paramount for you, I recommend you wait,as this is a train with its destination still nowhere in sight but tends to take breaks at the stations in between(unlike Naruto and detective Conan). At least it doesn’t have the “GO READ THE MANGA”-ish Cliff hanger ending(for both the seasons). Action and comedy strike a nice balance in keeping this show entertaining. If you are new to anime then nothing is a better gateway than this one. I’ve seen people who hate anime fall in love with this show.
And how can I forget the epic OST, it just heightened the enjoyment of this show
TL;DR:If you are lazy enough to read the review, I recommend you just go and watch this show nevertheless as out of the story,character,art and the epic music this show offers something will definitely catch your interest",10,blank4lulz

                In terms of story i wasn't blown away, it was solid but quite simple- not necessarily a bad thing but not anything too special. The characters weren't bad - despite some of them being a bit annoying i think that only emphasised the fact that they are children, in the way they act and their morals which is good because it leaves lots of room for growth- i am excited to know what the characters will be like as the series continues and as the characters get older and get fleshed out a bit more. 
I have to say i did enjoy this series a
                  lot and was in the fandom for a long time- i think there is a lot to work with in terms of the universe and a lot of questions that can be debated, such as hagakure's quirk, the traitor etc which make the consumer think and want to keep up with the show. 
So in short, good show and i am looking forward to seeing which way the series will go.",8,sunnydracula

                The opening quote of ""all men are not created equal"", really hits hard. Other people call this show mid, trash or something, well what really matters is preference, yeah I think the first season was solid not quite flashy, I really like the mangaka's way of portraying Deku as the underdog ( ughhh, shonen), the premise of the story was promising with all the quirk inheritance, having the duty to fill the vacuum that the number 1 hero will left because he will fall at some point, the villain shigaraki was trash, He's portrayed as this spoiled brat that always throws a tantrum when he
                  doesn't get what he wants, bakugo is a jerk idk why fans love him, he's a garbage ill mannered brat that wants to be the best at everything.

                Boku no hero is a fantastic anime about a boy Izuku Midoriya's or ""Deku"" goal to become a superhero although he is quirkless (meaning he doesn't have a superpower) and his told he can't do it. 
STORY:
I felt invested in the story of Deku following his dreams to become a hero although for his whole life he was told he couldn't do it.
I have never seen a show so incredibly well paced, from being quirkless to being at the hero academy it never felt like too much or too little in one episode. Although, it would have been nice to have an episode revolving Deku
                  during the entrance exam.
CHARACTERS:
Izuku Midoriya or ""Deku"": 
with a backstory of bullying and being told you can't do something, you just have to be invested in a character like that. Although he does stupid things sometimes, his heart is true and he really just wants to help.
All Might:
I really enjoy All Might's character because he is funny at sometimes (when he deflates his bluff) but seriously cool other times. I can see why Deku looks up to him. He also cares about his students which is nice. :)
Bakugou, Katsuki:
Katsuki's grudge is pretty ridiculous. Being mad at someone for wanting to help you? He's quick to act and thinks he's the best but to the point where someone can't help you just a little bit is a stretch. 
Classmates: 
there's no backstory to the other classmates but that can be expected, there's no time to develop every single character. But what i really liked is that you can distinguish all of them from one another with their personalities and character design.
ART:
Great art and animation. The character designs are perfect and distinguishable.
SOUND:
great ED and amazing OP! Voice acting was good too :)

                First, an admission: It is kind of hard to review this anime as Academia is not only based on a long-running manga series, but it also has a currently running season 2 at the moment. 
By itself, it would not be as good. 
That's not to say that what was in Season 1 isn't atrocious, however. The main character Deku and his relationship with All Might are always entertaining to watch on screen, a mixture of both comedic moments and emotional ones that tug at the heart strings at times. 
Deku, while imitating a lot of shounen manga by being the underdog character, is no
                  less an entertaining character to watch, from his deep desire to be a hero despite being quirkless to his selfless nature like in episode 1. His progression to become a hero through having to work harder than anyone else in the cast along with subsequently controlling a deadly power makes him even more endearing. 
Unfortunately, the rest of the cast like Uraraka or Iida do not get as much development aside from basic archetypes, as most of the focus is placed on Deku. While I understand why, as it is a long running manga and there is a season 2 that does expand on the side characters more, a little bit more development on the supporting cast could have alleviated that problem.
As for the story, that is currently hard to judge. Not a lot happens story wise in Season 1 as for the reasons stated above aside from seeing the main antagonists near the end of the season, so I'm giving it a median score for now and I'm just gonna wait to see how it turns out. 
The animation, as done by Studio Bones, is excellent. It's bright colors and visceral action moments remind me of classic American comic books and all of the characters ranging from human to a cement person make them all distinct and the world of My Hero Academia all the more quirky (pun intended).The sound is also well done too with a bombastic soundtrack fitting for the superhero genre and an addicting OP to get you hyped for what is to come. 
Yes, My Hero Academia is cliched with a shounen action story you have probably seen a million times before. Yes, it is a superhero story and seemingly not all that unique in a world of superhero movies coming out in droves. That does not mean, however, that these cliches cannot be done well.",7,CocoApocalypse

                For some reason I don't think I can review the whole series in total? Idky that is. But I like the first two-three seasons of MHA but then it starts falling victim to what I think a lot of anime that run for a long time do: roster bloat. There are soooooo many characters that everybody gets diminishing screen time so it's harder to get invested in anybody. If you wanna focus on everybody, break it out into different shows/series. That's what another franchise I like (Certain Magical Index/Scientific Railgun) does and it works well. Better than having 75 characters splitting 24 minutes.

                WARNING: SPOILERS
My Hero Academia was something that initially I had been avoiding to watch mainly because it came across to me that the story would mostly be told in the setting of middle school. This was not the case and I came to regret this when watching it. In my opinion, the story that this anime has is something that I feel is up there with Death Note (though nothing compares to the first half of Death Note I think we can all agree). I felt like My Hero Academia is objectively a good anime as well as a subjectively good anime. This anime is
                  something that created such emotion in the scenes that even I, as someone who doesn't really get emotional when watching anything, was beginning to tear up at some parts. The heroes initially I didn't really care much for the amount of characters there were, but I came to change my mind on this as well for the amount of interesting abilities that these characters had. Sure some of them are pretty much rip offs of other super heroes like Sero being a tape version of Spider Man, but I think that for the most part a lot of these abilities were rather interesting. I also think that the design for them all was phenomenal. The humor that this show has I think is just something that you either love or hate, and I don't think it's something for everyone but I personally enjoyed some of the less serious situations.
Favorite Character: Tsuyu Asui
Asui was someone who initially I thought I wouldn't like but again, I came to have a change of heart. Her chill and calm attitude was great, and ability to perform well under stress in her given situations was great. She is able to comfort her classmates as well which is also pretty nice. Finally, her power was something that I wasn't expecting and was actually a lot cooler than it was going to seem.",9,Hiroshiru

                My Hero Academia is a pretty solid anime about a society of superheroes. The anime follows Deku the MC who has no ""quirk"" (superpower) in a society where everyone has a power, who one day encounters the #1 hero and inherits his quirk. He journeys to become the #1 hero with the help of the friends he makes at Japan's #1 hero training academy. A typical episode consists of training and fighting with character interactions mixed in.
It's pretty great at what it is and never tries to hide it. Fight scenes are amazing in this show, but the general character development is pretty shallow in
                  most characters. 
The main draw is the fights. Also if you like MCs whose power grows over time and is effectively OP, this is a great show for that as the MC isn't technically OP but he consistently rises above and beyond to one-up all the villains he faces (usually not on the first try though.) It feels like each victory is hard-earned even though you knew they were going to win before it started. That isn't to say there aren't surprises or losses though.",8,Dr_Civilization

                TL;DR below.
Story 10/10
Midoriya Izuku was just a regular middle school student in a world where people with superpowers known as Quirks are the norm. However, he dreams of one day becoming a Hero, despite being bullied by his classmates for not having a Quirk. After being the only one to try and save his childhood friend, Katsuki, from a Villain, All Might, the world's greatest Hero, bestows upon him his own quirk, One For All. The story follows Izuku's entrance into Yuuei High School, a school that cultivates the next generation of Heroes.
Despite being a highly generic shounen anime, it was surprisingly better than expected.
                  The anime draws clear boundaries and balances out every super hero, other than All Might whom is clearly a few tiers higher than the rest, everyone else is pretty balanced.
Not to mention the villains, having a ultra strong super hero, All Might and his disciple Midoriya, we also have a super strong super villain, All for one and his disciple Shigaraki.
All preparing for the ultimate face-off between the two strongest quirks.
Character 9/10
We start off seeing the wimpy Midoriya, not able to achieve anything but if you were thinking you'd see a replica of Naruto, you though wrong. Midoriya had the Naruto personality that's for sure but after meeting All Might, he began to gain confidence, still wimpy but definitely much better off.
As for the other characters, well I'll leave it to you to find out!
Art 10/10
The anime  doesn't particularly have very fancy visuals or charismatic tone. However, what I like about it is because it is plain. Plain but vibrant too!
The art allows us to focus more on the story and all the characters better because we won't get captivated by the visuals of the characters so that is definitely an ULTRA PLUS point for the show!
Sound 9/10
I really love the sounds made by the different powers and also, the art style of certain characters also suit the voice acting perfectly! 
Take Shoto Todoroki for example, his voice is acted by none other than Yuki, Kaji and suits him perfectly!
TL;DR (Overall) 8/10
If you're wanting to watch an action-filled comedy anime, Boku No Hero really packs a *Smash*",8,DoomRanger

Now, yes this review is pointlessly late, but with season 2 out I thought maybe I could quell any doubts that this series is bad. So as far as the story is concerned it is okay, it is full of tropes and cliches, its locked in a school setting (bleh mediocre) and for the most parts its just your everyday shounen adventure.

                  though the story is by no means surprising or truly original at that, it is an entirely enjoyable series. Now the sound and music is good, not really stand out music but that's not what i was watching out for or expecting anything really. Now the art this is where it stands out from the pack, using a more unique drawing style using deep colour, heavy lines, and animated outfits really draw your eye. Characters are about average, you know your standard hero who sucks at everything but the ""power of friendship"" always saves the day. This is kinda where i was going with the cliche part. Too often are there your shounen series with a weak ass lead only to be supported by a weaker cast who easily overtake super villains. Now with my thoughts out there who should watch this? I think everyone who is a fan of your classic shounens, naruto, one piece, and even some of the newer ones like one punch man. If you need deep story or outstanding character development or maturity look elsewhere.",8,bridgetheman

                •	My hero academia is one of modern big three. A shounen which is basic in most of its aspects, but executed excellently and feels different which is good.
The world is a familiar world. World of superheroes and villains, pretty basic.
This season is kind of a premise of the series.
•	The story is really good, gets you hooked up from first 2 episodes. It brought me the emotions I had a child, looking up to a superhero which was portrayed good.
The story revolves Izuku, where he is trying to adapt to the current society [most of them have super powers, but he does not]. This season follows
                  the way him starting in order to achieve his dreams i.e. become a hero like ALLMIGHT.
It has a school as a base for all the main characters, so the story progresses along with their school life.
•	Story 8 very good
Story is something refreshing and the way it plays out is really good.
•	Art 9 Great
Art is good and the animation is done by bones…
And we have allmight who can be seen as a jojos reference.
•	Fight 8 Very Good
Fight in this show are actually kind of like JOJO, where application is preferred over firepower.
•	Sound 10 Outstanding
The osts are really good.
•	Character 8 Very Good
The MC is a very good character, he is actually a thinking MC not like the usual straightforward and dumb MCs we usually see in a shounen [ it has become repetitive over the years]. There are some 1D characters, hoping they get developed in the future. Currently most of development is on MC.
•	Enjoyment 9 Great
•	Overall 8 very good",8,Sopseii

                Boku no Hero Academia/My Hero Academia is quickly growing in popularity, and with the second season winding down as I'm writing this, I figured I might as well rewatch the first season and write this review. My Hero Academia starts with about as generic of a story as you can get. Izuku ""Deku"" Midorya is a quirkless (that's this universes name for people without super powers) teenager who's had dreams of becoming a hero since he was young. Of course, he can't exactly do that without a quirk, so all the people in his life basically tell him to give up on his dream and
                  that he'll never be able to achieve it. That is, until he meets the #1 Hero, All Might, after being attacked by a villain on his way home from school. Eventually, All Might comes to see potential in Deku and decides to pass on his quirk ""One for All"" to him. The rest of the season then shows Deku getting used to his new quirk and beginning his life at U.A. High, a school for becoming a superhero. Despite this incredibly generic premise, MHA manages to bring out the best in its clichés and tropes. The entire world of My Hero Academia flips the generic superhero show on its head, mostly by having super powers (in this case, quirks) be a regular thing in the world. Society is dominated by super heroes, their quirks and villains. The first season doesn't go too deep into the world, it still does offer a strong story between Deku and his idol/mentor/teacher, All Might (as well as Katsuki Bakugou, but we'll get to him). I will give MHA a 7/10 for the story.
The art in MHA is very good. All the characters have unique and recognizable designs. I love the designs of the pro heroes, and most of the students (particularly best girl Ashido). With just a look at their character designs, you can tell what most of them are all about. Bakugou's spiky hair and aggressive smile immediately tells you he's easy to anger and has an explosive demeanor. I could go into more examples, but it's more fun to let you guys discover that for yourself. I'll just give this an 8/10 and move on.
The OP of this season, ""The Day"" is just fantastic. I honestly listen to this almost every day. The ED is also very good, but not nearly as good. The soundtrack is just great in general. I'm not a huge fan of music, so I can't say much more than that without getting into an area that I have no idea about. 7/10.
Now on to the characters. I really love them. Most of the characters in the first season are fairly one-dimensional, however I think that's mostly a good thing. By only giving the supporting characters a small amount of characterization (for now, most of them do get development later on), it allows for the show to focus more on the central dynamic between Deku/Bakugou and Deku/All Might. As for the characters they do develop, Deku is a very strategic thinker, which gets him a few victories in this season, although I think the part I like most about him is that he is not instantly great at using his new power, like I've seen in some other poorly written series. Deku is still very clearly new at having this quirk in this season, and I really like him growing into this slowly, rather than instantly. Bakugou, on the other hand, is amazing at using his quirk, and despite his harsh demeanor and aggressive nature, he is still shown to be very intelligent. I won't spoil too much else about the characters, but the few they do develop this season is great. 8/10.
Overall, I very much enjoyed the first season of My Hero Academia. I binged watched all 13 episodes in only 3 days. MHA has set itself up to be a fantastic long-running shounen. The first season shows off only the bare minimum of what MHA has to offer. The few amazing characters they have this season eventually evolves into a large group of fun and complex characters in the future (at least in the manga, however the show has been very true to its source material so far). I enjoyed this season greatly, with a 9/10. As a long-time fan of all things super hero related, I cannot recommend My Hero Academia enough. It takes some of the most tired tropes in shounen and breathes new life into them. Season 1 of MHA is getting an 8/10 from me, and I can't wait to see what this world will continue to offer in the future.",8,Nyrotike

                First of all i wanna say that this anime was probably one of the biggest suprises of my life as a weeb, i am that kind of person that try to avoid extremly main stream animes like ""My Hero Academia"", but this oppened my eyes.
Story 6/10: the weakest point imo, of course have a lot of interesting things but in general is the generic story about a little boy that wants to become an hero, the difference between my hero and a generic story is that is actually super well made (explained in the next topics), thats why is it so good.
Art 8/10: The art
                  style is not super super unique but is different from what is usual, but where this anime scores the most in visual terms is in character design, every character have a unique outfit adapted to his unique habilities, i think thats amazing because is something we lack in recent animes CREATIVITY!! (yes, even Momo outfit is amazing)
The less unique is midoria outfit but he is also the ""plane"" boy, so makes sense.
The animation is very good but nothing i should lose a lot of time talking about it.
Sound 7/10: some bangers, some of them very bad, other mid, so i think is an ok ost (excited for next seasons OST´s)
Characters 10/10: Daaammm such expressive personalities, they are not realistic as people normally complain but this anime was never made to be ""realistic"", i think the writter had a lot of work to make all of them different and with unique personality.
Enjoyment 9/10: I cried a lot, specially at the start, this anime have feelings and imo is the most important part of a piece of fiction, the meaning and the capability of making you feel something inside deep in your heart, obvious exist animes that do this much better but My Hero Academia is indeed a masterpiece in terms of feelings.
Like i normally do in the end of the reviews for animes i liked a lot, goodbye and thank you My Hero Academia.
overall 8/10",8,VitorP1914

                WARNING: Spoilers. 
First of all, let me start by saying I am by no means a lover of shonen in general and therefore can be biased against it at times, however, there have been and are shonen anime that I enjoy so try not to get too caught up with that aspect of this. 
Plot: 3/10 
If I had to sum up the plot with one word it would be convenient. Midoriya is born quirkless but yet his biggest dream is to be like his all-time favourite hero All Might and be the best hero in the world! Of course, he can't achieve that without
                  a quirk though... Good thing he accidentally bumps into All Might one day and it turns out that it just so happens All Might can pass his quirk down to Midoriya with no problem, letting him become his successor and fulfil his dream of being a hero! Oh and of course, All Might just somehow knows that this scrawny, whiny little kid has what it takes to be just like him, why? Because he just really, really wants to obviously. He said so at least! 
The absolute convenience of the plot is at times almost mind-numbing, probably the only set back Midoriya faces is that his one ex-best friend doesn't like him anymore (boohoo), and he can't control his quirk yet. Somehow though, none of this seems to really matter seeing as he ends up succeeding at everything regardless and everybody loves him for absolutely no reason anyway (maybe his quirk is actually just unlimited convenience?). 
Animation/Design: 4/10 
The animation in of itself is fine - there is nothing wrong with it and there is nothing great about it, it is just very average. However, the topic that bothers me the most with this anime at all and it's an argument that's been beaten to death is the sexualisation of specific characters, yea, it's unnecessary and honestly it's gross. Wrap it up however way you like - tell me that Momo absolutely needs her boobs out or else her quirk just won't work anymore, sure whatever, tell me that it was just very necessary to have a character commenting on others boobs and how he wants to touch them - tell me that it's fine that even the innocent characters blush over the skin-tightness of their outfits. Whatever. It's gross; they're teenage girls - there are ways that this could have been avoided, where female characters could have been designed tastefully while still incorporating quirks that wanted to be incorporated but at the end of the day the only reason this wasn't done is because the author knows that the anime community, by and large, has no issue sexualising teenage girls. 
Characters: 3/10 
Each of these three points are for Tsu, the only character I even remotely found entertaining. Every other character is about as two dimensional as the design, the main character is your typical weak-whiny into strong-unbeatable shonen trope, Bakugo has no personality other than random, baseless rage (which, is not a personality trait and is not interesting). I can barely remember any of the other characters names because they're that boring. Every character follows every trope that you'd expect them to follow. Don't expect anything amazing from any of them. 
Additional Comments: 
This anime, as a concept, is really good. Unfortunately, the execution left me less than satisfied. I understand that this review will probably hurt the fandom - I don't really care. This anime is overrated, boring and quite frankly not worth any of the praise it receives.",4,Strawboni

                This is not a series with much subtlety. Our hero promises to become ""the greatest hero of all time"" and gets trained by anime superman to face a group literally named ""the league of villains."" Our hero attends hero school where destroying and rebuilding full-scale model cities is somehow not entirely cost-prohibitive. Our hero's rival is so antagonistic that his superpower is literally explosions. Our hero's opponents are villains because they don't like heroes or society.
It's a fast paced 13 episodes that establish the setting and a lot of characters very quickly, and while the characters are very likeable and colorful, the world feels flat
                  and full of convenience. That doesn't mean there isn't a lot to like here, but this is clearly a series more concerned with cool powers and action sequences than it is with saying much of anything of substance.",7,buhtts

                With the western comic book heroes reaching new peaks of popularity, by getting numerous hollywood movie adaptations and breaking box office records it was only a matter of time when Japanese mangaka would grab the bait and try their own at writing a super hero manga. While not necassarily the first, but probably the most popular, Kohei Horikoshi started publishing chapters of his ""My Hero Academia"" in Weekly Shonen Jump by july of 2014. 
The series, which was seemingly strongly inspired by Shonen Jumps most popular output of recent history; Naruto, is meant to be an inspirational tale of a young man defeating his dispositions
                  and realizing his dream of becoming a super hero.
The setting, despite being pretty similair to Disney's 2005 film ""Sky High"" definetly seems promising, especially considering the world it's trying to immerse the viewer into. In episode 1 we are introduced to a world, where super heroes are like celebrities, who through good deeds boost their popularity and status. On the top of the super hero chain stands All Might, who is a big inspiration to Izuku Midoriya, the main character. This set up is something, that could have spawned a handful of good possibilities within the plot. Unfortunately Horikoshi doesn't play with his setting quite enough and instead resorts to typical formula fiction of the ""battle shonen""-subgenre, which uses over-the-top battles as the main attraction to which the plot tends to lead to. 
Returning to the lead; Midoriya. He is the main driving force of the story. Nature has not been kind to him and among other humans, which consist of 80% super-powered mutants (an information, which appearently exists solely to make his backstory more tragic), he is the only one, who despite his handicap strives to become a super hero. With him being shown as a smart kid, who likes analysis a lot, all the pieces are set to make him the first quirkless super hero, who could even despite his lack of  powers overshadow his peers. Like Batman. Unfortunately that's not the case. I won't spoil what happens, since it drags past the first episode, but despite it handling Midoriya's hardships decently, it does the idea of it being an inspirational story a disservice.
The series covers only a fraction of the existing story of the series, since it only lasts 13 episodes, unfortunately leaving most of the side characters feel one dimensional and like one trick (well 2 trick in Todoroki's case) ponies. The only character, who gets a fair share of screen time beside Midoriya, is his classmate Katsuki Bakugou, who has a severe case of pathological narcissism.
With the plot being mediocre and the characters not quiet satisfying enough it is however worth mentioning, that the series is well animated and gives quite pleasing action scenes.
Looking at the series as a whole, My Hero Academia only stands out from other battle shounens by a hair's width. It's worth watching if you're a fan of battle series or if you want something light-hearted to watch. But if you expect complex story telling, the series will likely fail to impress you.",6,robiu013

                My Hero Academia is one of the most perfect modern starter animes for anyone out there looking to get a friend into anime. It's fun, colorful characters are eye catching and engaging. It has great fight scenes, unique powers for each character, and boy does it get creative with how characters use their powers. 
The main character is one of my favorite anime characters ever, and that's partly because of his relatable anxiety when it comes to meeting his heros. Deku wants to be a hero, and he'd do just about anything to help others, but he's also kind of a nervous wreck and one
                  of the most humble shounen protagonists ever. It makes him come off as very charming and the audience connects well with him. 
Deku is also very optimistic, and since it's shounen, we get a LOT of speeches about believing in yourself. However, this anime isn't all about friendship, in fact this anime has a very beautiful message about loving yourself, and using your own abilities to get further in life. And does it in a way that isn't patronizing, or looks down on others FOR relying on other people. Part of being a hero is helping others, and the other part is learning to support your own problems in a healthy way so that you can help other people. 
The characters are all honestly great (Except for one, we don't talk Mineta Minoru) and they all have relatable problems that I'm sure will touch anyone very deeply. My Hero Academia is also an anime that loves Thematic Parallels, and there's a whole bunch woven through the story that involve Deku and the Main villain. 
The Music in the show, especially its OPs, are all great. My personal favorite op out of all 5 is Peace Sign by Kenshi Yonezu. It's such a happy, motivational song that it just fits right in with the series' tone as a whole. 
All in all, the show is great, the animation is top notch, the music is amazing and will haunt your playlist forever, and the story will have you from the get go. I'd recommend this for anyone wanting to start off with watching an anime for the first time!",9,LiseranThistle

                Eh I guess I gotta redo the review now the anime is over and I'll immediately say last two eps were nice but we'll get to that.
Hero Academia...What to say about it? Well first I gotta say that despite my rather ech score of it I do not despise the anime. It is something that seems to call back to anime of our youth where main character starts off as a weakling but then he obtains a power that makes him strong and his will only makes it stronger etc etc.
The problem with Hero Academia is that it is a jumbled mess of mediocrity that
                  only frustrates me due to it's great,well a bit more than average, potential.
Art and sound. Superhero anime are supposed to incite the power of characters' abilities into us with audiovisual goodness. This anime however doesn't do that. You'll see a character yelling and unleashing one of his strong attacks but there's no music or sound effects to punctuate the seriousness of his move and the lack of any wow inducing animation in those parts diminishes the impact. Not to say that animation is bad it's decent and it takes that Shaman King-like character look,as in there's a huge variation on bodies and characters are rather smoothly drawn without too much emphasis on detail. If you haven't figured out I like the art style tho what they do with it is just by the numbers presentation. Opening theme is somewhere between ,,high fist pumping hurrah,, and ,,yet another anime opening,, and closing theme is okay so let's get down to the score.
 LAST TWO EPS ADDON BEFORE WRAPPING UP:
 Okay I didn't feel like incorporating this into my whole review because it's mostly isolated to last episode. There's a big hoedown with a strong villain and animation feels damn fitting. However that wasn't enough to make me up the score so it'll stay a 6. It was a bit above average but not enough to make me give it a higher grade.
Story is as I already mentioned typical underdog story. 80% people have super powers and 20% don't of course our protagonist doesn't. One night as he was passing the alley with his parents a robber popped out of shadows and killed his father and mother. Mourning their loss he swore he'll become a crime fighter. Yes I'm taking a piss that's not what happens. Our protagonist Izuku dreams of becoming a hero.Even tho the society keeps mocking him for that his life is changed when he meets his idol and world's strongest hero, All Might or Strongy Of Strongstown The Third if you will. Strongy is looking for a successor to his power One For All but first Izuku has to train so his body could handle the power. He does that, boom he's able to take the power but not control it.Whenever he uses it he breaks the body part he's using. He enters an elite school for heroes and shenanigans unravel. I don't want to go into detail and only thing I'll mention is that The League Of Villains,the antagonist, shows up about four episodes before the end which is a bad thing by the way. The whole story is half baked and seems to be rushing things trough.
 LAST TWO EPS ADDON DING DING DING:
Now in the end there's a bit of a twist and a foreshadowing of some spooky organization which seems to be left for the second season but more about second season thought in the closing.
Also before this finished I gave story a 5 but now I'm giving it a 6. That's it go away.
Characters. I don't want to stick to these for too long. Characters are mostly describable in one word apart from maybe one,potentially two, of them. Honestly if you saw any anime of similar construction you probably know half the characters. I'll touch on All Might tho. I don't want to reveal stuff about him but I liked his generic hero behavior  mostly because he was an overpowered character with actual weakness. He's not too deep but was enjoyable to a point.Here's a 6 because I'm a such a cuddly lil' puppy, also because characters weren't too bland. 
LAST TWO EPISODES CURE COMMON COLD: 
That's a lie last two episodes change nothing in the character department okay bye.
Enjoyment is bwah. Bwah being the sound I make after a blowjob but also after watching an anime that promised me a lot during it's early episodes but the longer I watched it my enthusiasm fell down and I ordered strippers to make my enthusiasm erect again . It's pretty monotonous and doesn't have the kind of drive needed to break trough it's shackles of mediocrity. Here's a 5 for enjoyment tho I'm ready to change that if last two episodes contain 40 minutes of uncut emotion filled fights with a narrator passionately telling a extremely interesting story in the background.
LAST TWO EPISODES SAVE A BABY FROM A FLAMING BUILDING:
I left the past closing line for enjoyment but I did increase it by 1. Why you ask? Because it contained a pretty awesome fight,tho it lasted much less than 40 minutes, and a teaser for second seasons villain. Here's a 6 now get out of my life till second season airs.
Here's an overall 6 , if you came this far dear reader I hope you'll have a nice day and won't take this review too much to heart. If you did like Hero Academia you aren't a social reject,not for that reason at least, everybody is entitled to their opinion. It's to be noted that this anime has so much going for it and season two can easily become a good anime.
THE SECOND SEASON BECKONS:
Now you can skip this if you wanna go do some important stuff like brushing your cat you lonely dweeb however if you want to listen to me some more here's what i expect from season two in short.
Art and sound should be stronger make that sound stronger when hits land and make some more impact with those animations. Story is something I don't want changed much I just want it to be good enough to not ruin my enjoyment, so basically minimal work on the story. Please make characters develop or at least interact. You have some interesting chars in your arsenal bloody use 'em. 
I guess that's it basically what this anime needs isn't some grand overhaul but rather a mechanical checkup. So long suckers have a nice day.",6,ipoopcandy

                I've finally hopped onto the hype train. Honestly, I get the hype. Listen, if you're bitter about this anime because it's ""just another shounen,"" then don't @ me, but BNHA is super fun to watch. 
Okay, so, the ART. First things first, I'm gonna be straight, I'm not in love with all of the character designs. Some of them actually made me cringe a bit. HOWEVER, as a whole, the art style for this anime is phenomenal. I think it pulled off the comic book feel very well, especially when you look at the shading and color this anime has. Sound design is absolutely... like...
                  fight me if you don't think it's awesome. Obviously, the OP and ED songs are great, and the seiyuu work is stellar, but just the BGM is something I could on about for the rest of this review. The composer, I believe, is the same composer for Haikyuu!! so I quickly understood why it was I loved the music in BNHA.
Alright, I won't lie, I expected more from the characters. That's probably one of the only reasons I don't have this listed as a ten. I'm aware that more is to come, and they'll probably get properly fleshed out, but I'm reviewing this season, so it is what it is. Basically, I just didn't feel much weight behind the characters' personalities other than Midoriya. Although, all of the characters are super fun to watch on screen. I do see a lot of potential with many of them going forward, so I'll be excited to see if their well-written and diverse personalities will turn into well-written and interesting storylines.
The story itself is, yes, another shounen plotline, but listen. The typical shounen template can be used very well if it's paired with great world-building, and I felt like BNHA had it. Going back to the comic book style, it came across nicely in the tone of the story/anime as well. That original touch really brought out the uniqueness of BNHA. Other than that, so far, the story has been fairly average. Don't get me wrong, it set everything up perfectly for the future. I wasn't disinterested in the slightest the entire time, and that's difficult to do for the early stages of a story. 
Essentially, I can sense that this season was very much a spring board for what's to come. With the amazing art, music, writing, and character potential this anime has, I can't wait to continue. The hype is real, and the hype is accurate. On to the next.",9,BabyGirl06301

                (This is the first part of a series of video and written reviews called The Decline of My Hero Academy)
My Hero Academy's formula for success in season 1? Fun, loose tone. Solid animation and visuals. Characters that are loose enough to feel fun in a world that doesn't appear to take itself too seriously, which is for the best in a battle shounen.
What surprised me the most when re-watching was how fun and loose season 1 was. I had become so used to the tired and tedious melodrama and bland villains of the later seasons, that I had forgotten what made the first season good:
                  the amount of effort that’s put into its visuals and its tone.
Like I couldn’t believe All Might swore in season 1 while re-watching. It made me laugh every time because it was one of the few moments All Might felt human to me. As if his public image was just that, a façade put on for the public, and that he was a different guy when not in front of his fans or the press.
You’ll also notice there’s a lot of effort put into making the visuals engaging. Season 1 is very light-hearted and loose, something that is loses in the later seasons, opting for overly serious villain arcs that fall flat for a myriad of reasons I’ll get into later.
The production quality and tone become a much bigger problem later, but for now everything seems to be nicely humming along. This applies to the other 2 big things I wanted to talk about for season 1: Deku and Shigaraki.
Here’s a brief overview of what happens in season 1:
My Hero Academy takes place in a world where people can have quirks, which are superpowers basically. 80% of people have them at this point, but our protagonist Deku doesn’t. He idolizes All Might, and through a chance encounter ends up inheriting All Might’s ability. But, he struggles to control it and it tears up his body. Deku enters UA, the school that All Might went to, and begins going through the entrance exams and then begins life as a student. But during a training exercise, a group called the League of Villains (led by the series’ primary antagonist Shigaraki) raids the school and attacks the students. They are defeated without any casualties among the students, and season 1 comes to a close.
The Quirkless Debacle
I have a lot of issues with the way Deku is written, but for season 1 I think he works fairly well as the protagonist. I like the way the show establishes the traits he possesses that make him the worthy pick to inherit All Might’s ability over other, more talented potential vessels. Namely, the scene in episode 4 with the blob monster that ultimately becomes the deciding factor for All Might choosing him.
The problem I have with Deku in season 1 is that Horikoshi uses him to ask a genuinely compelling question, and then does nothing with it. When Deku first asks All Might “Can I be a hero too?”, it poses an interesting quandary…can someone without powers be a hero?
The question is really interesting and becomes more interesting as you go along considering basically every major character has a quirk. The only times this theme is brought back up are briefly with Melissa Shield in the first movie, and with Mirio in season 4. But it never really gets into it in as much detail as you’d like.
To solve this, I think it would be neat if One for All had an activation period. Where Deku would have to survive entry exams with a barely budding, weak version of One for All rather than having it be so powerful he can’t control it and it injures his body. Because at least then the answer to the question ""Can I be a hero too?"" isn't ""yes, but only if you have powers"".
After all, the definition of heroism they seem to like going back to after season 3 is ""a hero's job is to turn the lip service into reality"". The idea there, is that superpowers are not what makes someone a hero. What makes you a hero is if you can ""turn the lip service into reality"". It doesn't really say anything about superpowers. In fact, a statement like that, and when you think about how Deku throwing himself at the blob monster to save Bakugo despite having no powers is what convinced All Might to transfer the power to him, it’s fair to say that the traits that makes someone a superhero rather than just a guy with powers is explicitly unrelated to superpowers.
So why aren't there more examples of heroes or villains that don't have powers? People who overcame their handicap and became examples of what a hero can be even without a quirk? They set up Deku like he was going to be that, but then immediately retreat from it and the idea isn't played with again.
This plot choice bothers me because it’s the first big question MHA asks its audience, and it doesn't give that plot line enough time to come up with a good answer before basically erasing it from the narrative. It sets itself up to do one thing that’s risky and interesting, and then retreats to a safer choice that’s more convenient to write around later. When we get to the later seasons, you’ll notice My Hero Academy tends to do that a lot.
As it's set up, his power damaging his body is an okay way to prevent All for One from being so strong it feels like a cheap way of getting out of having a quirkless protagonist, but as you’ll see later the series doesn’t like to stick to it.
Shigaraki
The last thing in season 1 I wanted to talk about is Shigaraki. Shiggy is a bit difficult to discuss because Horikoshi’s intentions for the character aren’t always clear. Is he supposed to be stupid and incompetent? Is he supposed to be brilliant and intimidating? Horikoshi doesn’t always make it clear, but like most things in season 1, Shiggy is pretty simple to judge. After all, when you look at him divorced from the context of later seasons, Shigaraki is either a very, very badly executed attempt at an intimidating, intelligent villain; or a villain that’s written to be stupid on purpose at the start so that you can see him grow and become more threatening as the series goes along.
My take is that he’s written dumb on purpose here. His childish tantrum throwing, his empty words and half-baked ideologies that seem to indicate nothing whatsoever is going on upstairs, and the students and All Might repeatedly insulting him seem to point to the show being self-aware of how dumb and childish he is. In this context, how badly the raid goes for Shigaraki makes sense. After all, he’s supposed to be a moron here. And the results he gets reflect that. I think maybe you could have had him kill someone to establish him as something of a threat considering this scene makes him look incredibly stupid, but that isn’t an issue...yet.
Conclusion
Overall, season 1 of My Hero Academy is very solid. Good action, decent characters, and the looser tone lends itself to a much more enjoyable viewing experience compared to later seasons.",7,Buuubbblesss

                This review does not contain spoilers, feel free to read it.
I really recommend this anime, if you like Shounen, you'll love this one.
To start off, the animation and production of this series is top tier, with some of the best animators out there and many young talents. It specially shines in the important moments of the anime, so it gets you hooked more and more with every chapter.
In this first season the story does not play an important role, as it is more focused on introducing all the characters and their motivations and, although the pace is really good, it lacks something. Even though, it
                  is a good start for what is coming in 2nd season so nevermind.
Last thing I would like to comment is the BSO, OST or whatever you want to call it. I started watching this anime without knowledge of anything about it and the one thing that shocked me the most was the soundtrack. It's simply perfect for the show, and it became one of my favourites BSO from an anime. I mean, Yuki Hayashi's works are too powerful, they get you hyped when they want (I am currently listening to one of yuki's songs as I write this review haha).
And last, if I had to give a score to every part it would be:
Animation: 9
Story: 8
Characters: 9
Soundtrack: 10
I hope this review will be helpful for someone that hasn't seen the show.",9,FishAmorphus

                Just a quick warning ahead of time, this is only in reference to the first season. I'm actually getting through the second season right now and I quite enjoyed the sports festival arc. 
When watching this anime, I had just recently completed Hunter x Hunter and saw a lot of similarities between the two, that being the whole group of very talented teenagers going through a rigorous examination to obtain an idolized profession for their own unique reasons. Naturally, although this might have been unfair as they are two separate stories, I began to subconsciously compare the two. All of that said, if you've ever
                  seen Hunter x Hunter, you would know that Boku no Hero Academia doesn't hold a candle to it, and I think that's going to be the basis of this review: the first season of Boku no Hero Academia is another shitty carbon copy shounen anime with an almost absurd lack of depth to it abnormal for its genre. Keep in mind I have no animosity towards shounen animes, this one's just shitty. 
The premise of Boku no Hero Academia is okay at best: that slowly through what can be speculated as evolution, humans began to develop ""quirks"" which grants a supernatural like ability and can be wielded as weapon for righteous or evil intentions depending on its user. However, because of genes or a toe joint or some shit, a small portion of the population aren't granted these same blessings, which is where our protagonist comes in: Midoriya Izuku. 
The main sympathetic point of Izuku is that despite his childhood aspirations and idealization of heroes, especially All Might, because of his born circumstances, he would naturally never be able to become a hero. The opening line of the entire anime is, ""All men are not created equal. This was the reality I learned about society at the young age of four."" I would say this is the foundational concept for Izuku's character, and it's is an interesting enough concept, they just never really expand on it beyond a couple of faceless classmates exclaiming that he would never achieve his dream and Bakugo being an almost comical bully in how he just yells. Despite being such a major plot point, it's really hard to take seriously with all of the faces he pulls whilst crying. It is an attempt to mimic All Might, but a lot of these scenes I just burst out laughing for the wrong reasons. Thus, Izuku was never really a sympathetic character to me, the author could have easily took his time in establishing an actually well-thought out back story, but by episode one we have already met All Might, and I think that is Boku no Hero Academia's fatal flaw. It attempts to cram way too much into one season as opposed to an anime like Hunter x Hunter where the Hunter exam takes twenty episodes yet still keeps their viewers hooked (sorry, I just couldn't resist the comparison). 
The other major characters of this season are Katsuki Bakugo and All Might, neither of which I'm particularly fond of. Let's start with All Might. The author seems to have a weird fondness for America as it's referenced quite frequently in random interjections, and All Might seems to embody this as a big burly blond man wearing red, blue, and white while also having random lines in English. He's a very simple hero, exclaiming in a loud, masculine voice, ""It's fine now. Why? Because I'm here."" And although I believe that simplicity is the entire point of his character, there's nothing interesting about him. I literally just do not care whenever he comes on screen, and he's supposed to be the supreme, most powerful hero in the entire series. This is an obvious problem. His non-flexing counterpart is not very intriguing either as it mainly just serves for bizarre comic relief, nothing really relevant to the plot. Honestly, the funniest character in the entire series is the mic dude. 
As for Bakugo, his entire character is just mean with a very lacklustre depth to him. He's a continuos bully that doesn't actually act like how a real bully would, he mainly just calls Izuku useless (Deku), constantly threatens him, and jokes that he should kill himself. The supposed depth to him is that because of the overwhelming amount of praise he's received from adults, classmates, and even Izuku himself, he's developed an intense hubris and belief that out of everyone around him, he is inevitably in every scenario the best one. It's an okay concept, but it's hard to feel any emotion about it as he's just yelling all the fucking time, even when it's supposed to be an intensely emotional moment after he loses to Izuku. I literally just don't care about what is supposed to be the main emotional dynamic in the series, because the author doesn't allow me to care by making these characters so one dimensional and almost non-human in the way they behave. 
As for the side cast, they are kind of just there. They have certain moments that suggest that they might become an actual character of interest, but they're never really expanded beyond that. As for the female characters, the manga author, what's his name, I actually hate him so much. He continuously sexualizes these minors with in his own words ""self-insert"" character Mineta to where their main character trait is ""girl"" and ""hotted boobs"" despite their potential. Take Yaoyorozu for example. She was a hero recommendation and thus has immense talent in both her quirk and intelligence, but if you've seen her hero ""costume,"" it's clear how the author actually sees her. It literally makes me want to smash my computer. There are some interesting characters like Todoroki and Kirishima, but they're never really expanded upon in this season, just kind of left to dry.
The art is fine, although its style lacks for any sort of emotional connection with what's happening onscreen. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul, but if you've seen how characters are drawn in Boku no Hero Academia, they're just tiny little pupils. You have no idea the amount of restrain it is taking to stop comparing this anime to Hunter x Hunter, especially in this section.
The sound is also fine, the soundtrack is not particularly moving though and doesn't do a great job in establishing tone. It's whatever though.
Overall, the first season of Boku no Hero Academia is mediocre at best. I believe that despite the childish premise, it has immense potential as seen by how its massive fandom has claimed these characters as their own and expanded upon them in more thoughtful ways the author ever could. The issue with Boku no Hero Academia is that it has no flow and is immensely crammed, which results in a stunning lack of plot depth, character development, and intrigue. It's not horrendous to watch though, so I'll give it that.
TLDR: mediocre shounen anime, lack of depth in plot and character, extremely rushed, oversexualization of female cast, one dimensional main characters.",5,pogety

                The show is very much a 9 across the board in terms of story, art, sound, and character development. Although, I would say my personal enjoyment was 10/10; I watched the show as it came out and man was it hard to wait for the next episode.
The summary is already provided and is quite accurate so I will not summarize. I will just explain why the show is not as lame as a lot of other shows across the hero genre and others.
The thing that makes anime worth it is a sense of purpose the character has, without undue melodrama by him/her and those around
                  them. Midoriya seems whiny at first, and I started the show out afraid that it was another run-of-the-mill series with an overpowered protagonist. However, there are several things set in place to make Midoriya well-rounded and thought through. He has studied the art since he was a child and had to use his wit because he grew up quirk less (powerless) unlike the rest of his classmates. He is driven by his incredibly large heart and selflessness; a trait that they keep consistent throughout. Basically, his personality is quite like Superman in that sense, where he stands for good vs. evil; but without the invincibility. 
Another major piece is the level of maturity of the anime. There are no unnecessary lewd scenes, every scene has a purpose, and characters have very human responses to everything that is outside of their control. Even as quite a young audience can watch this show and enjoy it for what it is, it's not cringe worthy where you wish characters had not said or done something as someone older viewing. 
A main theme in most anime is admiration for another character or the main character. Usually, the person who is admired is quite average but dramatized to fit the image of ""unattainable"" by others. Like those shows, we do have a strong character who is unlike the rest, however, he has apparent weaknesses and is limited in the way overpowered characters are usually not. Further, the show does not have one-dimensional characters who talk about their extensively-useless feelings every five minutes. 
Lastly, one of the best parts is progression of abilities for ALL characters. Where characters have very strong fighting abilities, there is an explanation; where they do not, they grow at a reasonable rate and you get to marvel at how they make way for themselves. 
Overall, the show has steady growth, likable characters, character development, and a very healthy dose of hype. If you are looking for the next good thing, this show is it.",9,ninjabia0

                Boku no hero's first season is probably one of the most boring and ''meh'' things I've seen and the worst season of the series
  I watched because a friend recommended me and although I think that all the following seasons are very good, this one just bores me to death. Nothing really happens It just starts and ends without nothing really happening, its just buildup/filler for the next season and even though build-up is essencial the serie end ups letting me unsatiesfied because I just watched 5+ hours of nothing
   The art was good, nothing special, I really liked the characther designs.
                  The only thing that really bothers me is the way hands are drawn like they are baloons
   Dont really have anything to say about sound, I did love the op but the ed was meh
   I actually really most of liked the caracthers even though the majority doesnt really have a personality just a couple characther traits. I especially liked midorya. He's just sooo adorable and I just want to hug him. He was probably the only thing that kept me from dropping this series
   Again, the only thing that brought me any type of enjoyment was seeing midoryas journey
   Overall, a solid six, but I would definatly watch it just beacuse the following seasons are much, much better and definatly worth your time",6,El_993

This show blew me away upon my first viewing and even though I've watched the show well over a couple times it still continuously manages to have a large impact on me. 
Why should you watch this show? Ties right into the story of this show, What is a hero and Why do I want to be one? The answer is different depending on who you ask. Some see a hero/this show as oppressive, while others see it as an inspiration. I see it as the latter, please read on

-Underdog story
-Overall grounded despite dealing with superhero society
-Great job of limiting powerful abilities 
-Good at throwing in twists and very good at building tension
-Diversified conflicts (personal, Interpersonal and physical)  for not only the main character but side characters 
-Demonstrate humans do heroic things, not superheroes do heroic things . 
-Plot of the show is constantly in motion, IT RESPECTS YOUR TIME
-Has many deep themes. Bullying, self esteem, idolizing, insecurity, mortality, and being a parent/mentor are just some aspects explored in just 13 episodes

-Top notch  
-Moments of just lip flapping are short lived especially for a certain character that is overly expressive with his hands 
-Characters are expressive and have a colorful appearance
-Tied in with great animation is the cleverness put into the use of quirks in the show. Despite a character having the ability to cause explosions he utilizes them in unbelievably creative ways. -Fights although short lived feel very impactful  and are really easy to follow. The last big fight in the season being particularity great with phenomenal camera work and visual effects that enhance not obscure the scenes.

-Contends with the amazing OSTs in shows like Attack on Titan and Hunter x Hunter
-Worth listening to even if you don't watch the show
-Music is utilized to enhance what the scene is trying to portray from sadness to hype
-Some soundtracks will make you re- envision those particular impactful moments in the show 
-Prefer the Subbed voice actors but that's not to take away from the good English dubbed as well
-The Subbed cast are phenomenal you really couldn't have picked more suitable VAs for all the characters because even the side ones do a great job 
                                                                  CHARACTERS
-The VAs are complimented by the phenomenal characters in the show
- A variety of characters are multi dimensional and all bring a unique perspective
-They think and behave realistically and some under go development
-Change doesn't always occur by characters fighting sometimes its done indirectly 
-This shows complexity comes from its characters depth and also from the world being very well connected by those characters
-Wide range of personalities and abilities makes for great interactions  
-Your sure to find someone that you can get behind
My utter enjoyment of the show is undeniable. There is an episode that the characters mention is “right out of a comic book” I couldn’t agree more. That moment to me captured perfectly what I love about shounen anime, the ability to defy unfavorable odds and surpass your limits. This show just cuts to the heart of things whether it be those depressive down moments or those elated nothing can stop me moments.
As a homage to Western comic book heroes and all the shounen shows prior to this anime, My Hero Academia is an amalgamation of what makes a show go PLUS ULTRA. With the mangakas Kohei Horikoshi very soul put into this series, teamed up with the phenomenal production done by Studio Bones you have a timeless anime that has gotten the attention of millions and will continue to inspire those that want a HERO.",9,Frozen0ice

                Many people see this anime in many ways, either you worship this series or you hate it beyond anything. To me I'm on neither side, I'll watch this series and have a good time but I won't mind if I dropped the series. The story was alright, it's definitely unique but to me, It didn't intrigue me all that much.  I definitely had a lot of fun moments watching this series, when Deku awakens his quirk for the first time I felt a form of satisfaction that definitely got my attention. The characters are interesting but at this point kinda underwhelming, I'd like to
                  watch future seasons and then I reckon I'll be more interested in these characters. The sound design is pretty good, especially the voice acting.

The superhero trope is squeezed bone dry. The most enjoyable part of this show is the part where it fades to the credits.
The characters are cool though, some characters even have a sliver of develooment. In seriousness, the show itself isn't horrible, it's perfectly fine being 'mid' and it will never be anything better than that. Maybe someone explain to me what's so significang

31964,"
                My Hero Academia (MHA) doesn't try too hard to break out of certain well-established formulas, but the execution is solid and the themes have a universal appeal. I feel that the creators of MHA have tapped the same sweet spot that western franchises like X-men and Harry Potter have, combining themes of growing up and fighting for what you believe in a setting where there is a clear distinction between good and evil. 
Maybe it will come later, but don't expect to see much philosophy in MHA season 1. Like another hugely popular show Fairy Tail (which I had to drop), MHA is heavily dependent
                  on giant chains of fight sequences that often don't have much context other than the typical ""hey, I'm the next bad guy and I'm here to kick your ass!""
//spoilers below
Story: ""fair"" because while it wasn't a bad story, it was extremely generic and didn't really offer anything new or interesting. That's not a bad thing, but high ratings in this category (at least for me) require either more originality or substance. MHA is a simple and enjoyable story, and it's strength is in execution.
Art: Character design looks great, and might be my favorite thing about the show. Certain characters like the frog girl (Asui) have a really distinct and well-thought-out look compared to more ""regular-looking"" characters like Iida, but what makes it great is that the characters' personalities fit the way they look. And it's interesting, because you wonder whether they act that way BECAUSE they look that way or whether the way we see them as the viewer is warped by our own biases.
Animation was also great, and fight scenes were very satisfying.
Sound: It was good. It's not that the soundtrack was bad, I've just been spoiled by too many good soundtracks since I started rating these things. Nothing stood out too much.
Character: As mentioned in the art section, character design (both appearance and script) was excellent, and probably the one thing that MHA really excelled in. At the end of season 1 we already have a pretty big cast of characters that we care about, and that's enough for me to want to see this show through the next season and probably beyond. Tsuyu Asui and Deku in particular had a great dynamic that I'd like to see more of.
Enjoyment: Very good! Because the show stays simple and true to the hero & academy genres, there isn't much complexity and not that much room for the creators to screw it up. As a result, we have a show that doesn't take too many risks and reaps the reward of not making any major mistakes. That predictable but somewhat satisfying arc makes for a very enjoyable 13-episode stretch.
I'm really looking forward to going through season 2, and now that there is an established cast of characters I'm looking forward to seeing them develop and finding out some more about their backstories. While MHA isn't going to blow you away, I don't see why anyone would trash the show or give it a really low score. It's pretty solid.",7,AnimeBear422

                It's the new Naruto.
My Hero Academia has become for a new generation what Naruto was to mine, and what Dragon Ball was for those who came before. It's a gateway anime and a masterclass in shounen that does more than just tick all the boxes of all the tropes you've come to expect. I mean, it does that, but it also manages to be a really good story anyway.
Superheroes were always a focus of western comics, but it's hard to ignore the huge internationally attention they've been getting for the past decade in multi-billion dollar big budget films. Boku no Hero is a product of
                  the merging of that western super hero aesthetic with the coming-of-age storytelling of shounen manga. Setting it at a school for superpowered kids is a simple and easy way to facilitate the kind of story arcs so prevalent in the genre. You want to have another tournament arc every week? Sure, why not? Just call it another lesson or exam. And we let them get away with it because what else are you going to have kids in high school do?
The show wouldn't work nearly as well without All Might and the sheer presence his character brings to the series. The switching from burly muscle-man to skeltal dying-man is both hilarious and effective in setting up moments where a seemingly weak character gets to do something awesome, one of the great strength of the genre. We see just how strong he is when the evil league of baddies attacks and we get our first look into what it means to push past your limits, to go beyond, PURUSU URUTURA! Sorry Christopher Sabat, it will never sound as good in American English as it does in broken Japanese Engrish.

                Well for starters I highly recommend this show to everyone. Really enjoyable script and the relationships with the characters is outstanding, no real filler episodes 13 episodes and it tells a story no cringeworthy dialogue and is just real fun to watch.
It's one of those shows where there really is no real villain and the stakes just don't feel that high, after all, it is set in a school.
The main character is set up properly and you never really think this could never happen in real life, no one has superpowers (quirks). It's also one of the only anime you can watch in dub as
                  it actually has good voice actors who know how to portray a character through the medium of voice.

                *mild spoilers, please watch out qwq really nothing major, mostly just things that are covered in the first few episodes.*
Boku no Hero Academia is the story of Izuku Midoriya, a seemingly fun, lighthearted, enjoyable shounen show that has taken *some* inspiration from western comic-books and the world of superheroes, and I have to say, for me season one was exactly that, with some surprises and unexpectedly good parts thrown in!
So let's talk about how this first season, while being the worst out of the three so far in my mind, was the start of an anime that eventually became one of my favourites!
Story - (
                  7 )
The show begins with, as stated above, our main character, Izuku Midoriya, a take on the probably well-known introverted, anxious, but intelligent type who, in this world where supernatural abilities - named quirks - suddenly emerged, is in the now rare group of people who are ""quirkless"", attracting bullying in school, predominantly by his much more powerful classmate Bakugo who, on the surface, seems like the typical mindless bully.
Izuku's life is filled with anxiety and he's trying to come to terms with the fact that his childhood dreams of becoming a hero will never come true, and that his idolising of his favourite hero, All Might, will stay just that - idolising, never being able to realistically aspire to such goals, but, of course, this is a shounen and the story quickly picks up as All Might notices Izuku, deeming him heroic enough to inherit his powers, becoming his mentor.
Fairly standard, even cliché story but with surprisingly good execution and the great characters (we'll get to that ^^) and their dynamics raise it to a standard where this simple premise becomes something great.
Art (9)
Not much to say on this front, it's great! ^^
it's a crisp, sharp, colourful animation style that's a mix between anime and basically any superhero comic-book from the last three decades with plenty of good motion, effects, and action, good flow, all the things you could want, it's not flawless, but more than good enough!
Sound ( 9 )
Again, not much to say on this front, other than it's really impressive in my mind, the voice actors and actresses are doing a fantastic job (in the Japanese dub at least, don't @ me about the English dub qwq)
The soundtrack is wonderful, even good enough to listen to by itself for me, particular highlights of it for me personally as far as season 1 goes are You Say Run, an exciting, well-composed music track perfect for action (that I'm also listening to as I'm writing this) and All Might's Theme, a great re-imagination of classical superhero themes!
I don't have many complaints as far as the sound goes, it's great, it fits, let's move on, I tend to write too much.. ^^
Character ( 9 )
I'm so, so tempted to give character a 10, and spoiler, in my later reviews I most likely will.
HeroAca, at its heart, is a character-focused shounen action anime and that more than shows.
Characters are very important to me and HeroAca thoroughly impressed me, even the more stereotypical, cliché characters are executed very well and they end up feeling so, so fresh and fun, not just the protagonist Izuku but the deuteragonists, tritagonists, and background characters too!
Season one is especially focused on Izuku though, like most of the show, but even more so in the first season I feel like, Izuku is a timid, introverted, awkward, but passionate protagonist who you can't help liking and rooting for, his main motivation is to become a hero and save people with a smile, to become what he idolises and aspires to be.
What I hadn't talked about before which I've been reserving until now is how much I love Izuku's power and effectiveness as a character. 
The reason for the criticised slow pace of the show is that it's slow because while yes, the story and worldbuilding are important, what's important right now is to see Izuku grow and follow him along his journey as he gets used to his newfound powers which, as of now, literally destroy his body, shatter his bones, and we follow along as he trains and uses creative, smart thinking to do his best while he's still very limited.
I could go on and on about different characters but take my word, they're great, I'll need to have a long character analysation about mainly Deku, Todoroki, Bakugo, and perhaps a few more in the future though!
Also, PS, I hate Mineta -w-
Japan, please, stop including pervy characters for no real reason :c 
Enjoyment ( 8 )
Let's wrap up this review now as I'm really getting carried away, HeroAca is a highly enjoyable show that yes, perhaps doesn't have the breakneck pace of similar shounens but still entertains and hooks you as you go, as you fall in love with every character except Mineta, as you enjoy the ride and see the characters grow before your eyes, whether they grow by themselves, by their mentors, or by motivating each other.
The pace does pick up slowly with the further seasons and, in my opinion, they're written much better as well, but season one is good at what it does - being a much needed introduction to a super fun, great show.
Overall ( 8 )
Overall I have to give season one an 8 as it's great, but aside from the, in my mind, emotional and amazing first two episodes and a few very fun fights, isn't much more then a setup for further things to come, and the writing could use some improvement which it definitely gets later on! ^^
TL;DR:
The start of a fun, very well-executed shounen show with plenty of unique things to set it apart from the other shounen giants, great characters, audio, and visuals, and a - so far - simplistic story that's fine as is, as it works.
Thank you so much for reading my first review! ^^",8,LilyMeoww

                Well, let's begin. It may have spoilers, but nothing that wasn't at the first or second ep or in the synopses. I'll advice when they appear.
Warning: I do like MHA, but not like some people that just say it is the best shonen ever, we still have YYH, FMAB and HxH to compare with.
I watched MHA in 2016, and it was like ""OMFG, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS"" and now I look back and think ""Well, it's quite good, but we've seen it all before"".
Like Naruto, for exemple. He was a rejected kid, but 'cause he have a nine tailed fox like monster inside
                  his belly that could destroy the village at any time. But with Deku is quite different. He is rejected because he do NOT have powers, so you, as an spec, feel represented with him. And that's good. Until ep 4 or 5, when he obtain that power, but not any power, my friends.
Now it may have major spoilers, just skip this paragraph. ALL MIGHT GIVE HIM HIS OWN QUIRK. So, he's quite strong, huh? But, wait, his body wasn't prepared to that power, so he has to train more and got his body strong enough to that quirk. And then the second best scene on season 1, in technical terms, like sound, art and animation, happens: the beach scene, when Deku finally got the last fridge out the shore, and yells in a nirvana of emotions. Now he is strong enough to this.
Anyways, when he finally got the powers, the anime really starts, and he discover life is sweet, but it's hard as well. The training part is one of my favorites of all seasons, so it is worthy just watch those episodes again and again. after that, we have the exam to enter the hero school. After, we have the school day to day, and some quirk tests. Oh, don't forget the field trip that goes wrong and everything. And don't forget the main villain as well.
Well, I think that's enough.
Story: 7. Good, but we've seen something like that before. Nothing new, so, average.
Art: 9. Great, but not perfect. In the manga it was better, in my opinion.
Sound: 8. What can be said about SFX and OST in a Shonen? It just fits like a glove in the anime.
Characters: 6. Fair, but a little bit exaggerated. Take Iida, exemple. He is the classic perfect student that become the Class President. Ochako is SUPER annoying with all the ""Deku, Deku"" thing. Jirou is the only one that is quite good.
Enjoyment: 9. I've watched it when I was 15, so it was really good at the time, it was the first shonen I watched knowing what the shonen deograph is. But now, the enjoyment would be something like 7 or 8. Yeah, 7.
Overall: (7+9+8+6+7)/5 = 7,4. Quit average, tho.",7,pedroguscos73

                Slade’s Quick Review
All might is alright, Deku is heck eww, and I don’t know anyone else’s name off hand. The super hype show of the forever is good! It’s just not amazing, and reason is because of the lack of development. The action in the show is really good and props to the show for actually trying with its massive supporting cast. However, the show does the same thing over and over and the worst part is that those parts are the good parts. When stuff is going on it feels fun and has you really involved and when stuff isn’t eventful my god does
                  it feel like your having to trudge through snow. Besides being a lot lighter hearted and a completely different plot it does feel a bit like attack on titan with its massive hype and slow plot. Though I liked attack on titan so keep doing your thing my hero, but please make something different happen…",8,Slade-VonParade

                Lazy people can read first and last paragraph
No Spoiler btw
Before you read realize I am pointing out mainly the flaws of the show, but it has many great aspects that make it well worth the watch.
Watching this show felt like having my 1000th bowl of cheerios, but I used whole milk instead of 2%. It is exactly what you expect from a generic shounen, but it has good art and comedy that elevate it from being painfully generic. This show feels like something straight out of a mid-1900's comic book, overused tropes and all. But it was worth the watch and pretty entertaining overall.
Story: 5/10
This
                  is the thing that annoys me most about the show. The story is so generic it is unbelievable, and as far as I can tell there is nothing remarkable about it, it is just the most generic plot ever. Boy wants to be stronger, then he gets stronger. I did lie a bit though, as the one thing I did find unique was All Might and the time limit to his power that seems to shrink every time he exceeds it, but that whole thing is wildly inconsistent and I will hit on that later. Overall pretty generic story, nothing special at all.
Art: 9/10
This is the best aspect. It isn't the Fate series or anything like that, but the rather simplistic art style works well with the consistent amounts of light humor. During fights, the art kicks into full gear and is filled with endless Sakuga moments (when the art ups itself to a whole new level for a big moment). Overall the art works very well for the show and its many elements.
Sound: 6/10
I'll keep this short. Good OP, good ED, but I didn't notice a single song in the entire show until the final episode when I realized I didn't notice a single song the entire show so I paid extra close attention. That isn't all bad, however, as that means it was bad by any means as I didn't hear it and think Oh My God turn that off, but it wasn't memorable either. So I think that means it adequately served it's purpose.
Character: 7/10
This is my problem with shounen anime. It seems that the more minor a character, the better their power, and the more major the character the more simplistic it is. Take Deku, All Might, Bakugo, and Tenya(fast boy) for example. Deku and All might are so generic I don't need to say anything about them. Bakugo is cool in that the combustion is from his sweat and he can store it up, but it doesn't function any different from normal combustion users in super hero shows. Tenya is literally just the flash if the flash was slow. Then there are characters that are extremely minor that have great and unique powers. Aizawa and his ability to erase other quirks is alright, and it is better that he also has physical ability outside of his quirk. Belly button guy is funny and his power is unique. Grape ball head kid is basically half the fan base when they see Momo and Uraraka in their outfits. And frog girl is literally basically a frog, and that still feels unique in its own way and kinda funny.  On the whole the characters just don't feel that special, they seem good but not great when I feel they have the potential to be better and it wouldn't take much. 
Enjoyment: 8/10
Action was great not even gonna lie, but my issue goes back to the story here and that is that it is very steriotypical which hurts the enjoyment because it makes it predictable. The comedy was very funny, and the action was nice to look at, but I walk into the show feeling like I can guess what will happen every scene before it even happens because the show fails to deviate from any trope whatsoever. It's flashy, it's fun, but it is hurt by how generic it is. Don't get me wrong though, it is still extremely enjoyable and worth the watch.
Overall: 7/10
This show is generic done best, and I think as good as it could have been for never deviating from any trope at all. It is very predictable, and very steriotypical, but it is saved by great art and comedy that lift the show for me. I just wish I wasn't able to watch the show and feel like it's a story I've seen a million times every episode, but hey they did a good job with what they had.",7,Pilot7766

                Boku no Hero Academia is a story about a boy named Izuku Midoriya or Deku who is born quirkless(quirk = superpower) and his struggle to become a hero. 
Story 3/10:
The story is as cliche as it gets. It's a typical show about superheroes with the heroes winning against every villain almost every time. There is nothing unique about this show and feels like a cheap remake of One punch man. The story is filled with plotholes with unrealistic fight scenes which favours the heroes almost every time. I would not recommend this anime to someone who wants a good story.
Art 8/10:
The art style and animation
                  are really good even though it's a bit childish and feel like a cartoon. The fight scenes are animated really well.
Sound 10/10:
Boku no Hero Academia would have not been as enjoyable if it didn't have the amazing music and background score. It's one of the major plus points of this anime which can give goosebumps in some fight scenes. I honestly think 'you say run' is one of if not the best anime OST I have ever heard.
Character 6/10:
The character development is a major turn down for a character-driven anime like BNHA. The main character is a wimp and remains a wimp for the entirety of the show. The other characters are more interesting in my opinion. The villains are some of the worst I have ever seen in an anime. they don't feel threatening at all.
Enjoyment 10/10:
If you don't focus a lot on the story then the anime is pretty enjoyable. it has funny comedy scenes and the fight scenes are very enjoyable. 
Overall 7/10:
Overall BNHA is a decent show with its fair share of enjoyable moments. I would say you won't miss anything if you skip this anime.",7,MajorBat666

                Pretty much this series, and others like it (Naruto, Bleach and other reskins):
Weak guy: I wanna be a hero
Strong guy: you can be a hero
*Weak guy gets his powers but fails*
Strong guy: You suck, but I believe in you!
*Filler*
*Weak guy keeps failing, but looks awesome while doing it*
This series might do absolutely nothing new, but it does everything right, and I love it so much. The action is epic, with incredible animation and sound work to boot. The characters themselves are enjoyable, yet cliche, but that's okay.
The only thing holding this anime back is the predictable story.

                This review is spoiler free.
Boku no Hero Academia is possibly the biggest show of the new generation of anime. Everyone knows it, it has a lot of passionate fans and it's generally a well rated show. But looking back to season 1, does it still hold up?
Story - 6 (Fair)
The story of BNHA is not bad. It's just your basic shonen story. But what makes it interesting is the setting, where superpowers, in this show known as quirks, are very common and part of everyday life. Being a hero is an occupation, like any other job out there. But our main character, Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya,
                  does not have a quirk, but he looks up to heroes, especially All Might, aka ""Symbol of Peace"". When he finds out that All Might's powers are weakened and he's looking for a successor, Midoriya is faced with a challenge to achieve his dream of becoming the number 1 hero, with the power of One for All. The story explores themes of heroism, what separates people who are heroes just for money or fame, and heroes of genuinely want to save people and make the world a better place. Though in season 1 it focuses more on introducing the characters and the setting, so the best moments come in later seasons.
Art - 8 (Very Good)
Studio Bones did a great job with the visuals of this show. The artwork of Kohei Horikoshi, creator of the original manga, translates well to anime form. Action scenes look great and the characters are very expressive. 
Sound - 7 (Good)
There's some great music in BNHA, but overall it's not that outstanding. The voice acting and sound design are good. Overall with this aspect of the show I don't have much to say. It's good, that's about it.
Character - 7 (Good)
There's a lot of interesting characters in this show, unfortunately a lot of them don't get explored that much in the first season. Deku is an alright main character. Bakugo, or Kacchan, is very unlikable character, but serves well as a rival. Ochako is cute and fine main girl, but doesn't offer much when it comes to her personality. All Might is a very interesting take on the ""American Superhero"" trope, but gets better later in the series. Other side characters are interesting, but don't offer that much at this point of the story.
Enjoyment - 7 (Good)
BNHA is a very enjoyable show in my opinion. The first season is just the beginning though, and I would be lying if I said I enjoyed it as much as the later seasons. But overall, it's a well made battle shonen that kept me entertained.
Overall - 7 (Good)
So... does BNHA deserve the popularity it got? I'd say so. I don't think it's amazing, but back when I watched it, it was definitely entertaining ride, good gateway series, and it just gets better with later seasons.",7,Weebbe

                Decided today that it's a good time to start writting reviews, and this seems like a great starting point. If anyone still hasn't given this show a try they don't know what they are missing. This review may contain small spoilers.
Story 8/10
The story is a typical shounen one. Main character struggles to become a hero even though he doesn't have super powers (or quirks as they call them here), while almost everyone around him has them. The hero he idolises gives him a quirk but he has to learn to control it. We follow him through his jurney of becoming a hero. While the story
                  is simple and stereotypical, it's written in a really good way and there are very few plot holes involved.
Art 9/10
Fluid animation and consisten art style.
Sound 10/10
Great opening and ending themes. The tunes fit perfectly over the scenes and emphasise the right feel of the moment.
Character 8/10
Very good character introduction, but slow developement. Some characters may appear as too one-dimentional in terms of character. This is however, well resolved in the following seasons. If we take them in account, overall character developement would be 10/10.
Enjoyment 10/10
Action packed scenes and quality commedy keep you wanting to watch more. Great balance between serious and comical moments.
Overall 10/10
One of the best shounen out there and I belive everyone should give this one a try. If the first season doesn't do it for you, the second and third one will, I assure you 100%.",10,SegiMan

                I watched season 1 and it was decent.
My favorite is eraser, I hope his injuries actually make him stronger. All might is way awesome. I didn't know there would be more seasons, but I hope it stops at season 1 I don't want them to ruin it. The power shown by all might is ridiculous. It is really super cool.
It was cute the chicks were saved by the guys. The strongest chicks were at level of just making small objects slowly come towards her. Very very cute. The guys did a very great job saving and keeping them safe. This is the cute I look
                  for.  I loved how All Might explained how it can't be inherited by anyone, and he has to train the body, making it very clear no chick can inherit it. So cute.
However there is some stupidity, like the whimp-iness of main character (MC) in his dealings with the girl he likes. He even lets her call him something that is used as an insult by another guy. And he lets her definition of it, guide him. Both of which is a huge negative on his growth as a man.",7,blagoh

                This is the first anime that I watched in a long time that had that ""shounen""feel to it,just like Bleach,Naruto or One Piece!I don't know how to describe it but it's there!That feeling that makes you wanna watch more,learn more about the side characters.makes you wanna life in that world as a character and so on.My hero academia definetly had this ""shounen"" feel.It's like I was watching my childhood anime all over again!The characters are all interesting and epic(still couldn't decide on a favorite).The pacing is great(even though it covers only 2 small arcs).The animation looks sick in all the action scenes,going along with the
                  amazing soundtrack to match every awesome moment and the overall epicness of this anime managed to get me pumped for every episode.I've watched Re:Zero,Jojo,Kabaneri,etc. but this is the only anime this season that managed to get better and better with every episode!You should definitely watch it and after finishing it you should definitely read the manga!I honestly think that this is the shounen series to replace the big 3 in the future or even surpass them,who knows?",9,Varen-san

                Great addition  to current animes that are airing. 
Overall story: The overall premise isn't new. Inspiring students dedicate themselves to save the world. The writing itself is what makes the story interesting. The story moves at a good pace with not many fillers. 
Characters: The MC is pretty cliche. I find him to be predictable and boring. With that being said, almost every other character that is a part of the main cast is very likable or interesting. The deuteragonist especially is well written and brings complexity to the story. Due to his character he is easy to hate but slowly begins to show
                  character growth by the end of the 1st season.
Art Style/ Directing: The choreography for the fight scenes is my favorite aspect of the show. The creativity is apparent when it comes to the battles between the MC and the 2nd MC.",9,minjosudi

Music: 8; Has many great hype songs, but most of the more everyday soundtracks were forgettable.
Characters: 6; They were fine. They were all really fun characters, but most are very one-sided and doesn't get any development.
Enjoyment: 9: It was so fun to watch this anime! the hype scenes were great, it was funny and just enjoyable overall
Spoiler review:
Story:
I don't have much to say here. Most of the scenes were handled very well. I really liked the kind of symbolism of all-might's forms. That his bigger form is the symbol of peace and the form he wants to show the world, and the other form is something he doesn't want to show the world to keep the symbol of peace alive. 
Something that this shounen anime doesn't do that many other shounen animes do is increasing the power top. In the last episodes, we see all might go full out. This is the top. This is what Izuku is thriving to get. By doing this we kill two birds with one rock. We make sure that the power top isn't increasing, and we get to see Izukus power goal. 
But I did have some problems.
One of them is that it doesn't make sense how some of the people got through the first U.A test. How did Mezo get through? He can just put his body parts on his arms, how does that help to destroy robots? Or maybe Mineta, whose quirk is to pull off balls of his head that can stick really well. or maybe Toru who is just invisible. 
Another thing that I didn't like was how the powers were handled. For example, if Bakugo can get thrown forward if he makes an explosion behind him, why doesn't the exact same thing happen when he makes a giant explosion? 
Visuals:
I really liked the art style that the characters have. The sharp and comic book style it has. 
The animation is also great. You get to see that in scenes such as; Izuku punching the robot and all might vs numo. 
It also had many good character designs; such as Midoriya (both with and without the hero suit), but especially the hero suit. The reason for that is because it shows his love for all might while also being really cool), All might (the reason why I love his design is again because of his two forms. You can see that in his big form he looks like the big tough superhero, while his other form doesn't), Eraserhead, Yuga, Tsu, Lida, Ochaco (hero suit), Ojiro (hero suit), Kirishima (without the hero suit), Koji (without hero suit), Jiro (both with and without the hero suit), Sero (hero suit), Fumikage (both designs), Todoroki (without hero suit), Bakugo (both designs) and Momo (hero suit). 
But it also has a few bad designs, like; Mina (Both designs. She looked weird), Koji (hero suit. Very forgettable), Sato (hero suit), Todoroki (hero suit) and Tumora. 
Music:
Has many great hype soundtracks like you say run, but the more everyday soundtracks were forgettable. The OP was good while the ED was very good.
Characters:
They were fine. They were mostly one-sided and not really developed, but we're all really fun. My least favorite in this season would probably be momo cause she is basically a perfect character. But something I really liked was Bakugo. I understood why he was so angry. He was at the top for so many years and now he got to go to the upper class and he wasn't at the top anymore.
Enjoyment:
As I said before, really liked watching the show. The hype scenes worked great and the characters were all fun. 
It was overall a very good show",8,Protogeist

                Overall I find the story Very enjoyable as the main character, Deku discovers/explores his new quirk. The art is also nice as everyone has a unique face yet they all fit within the same art style. The show was animated by Bones which is know for producing some other shows with great animation like Soul Eater and FullMetal Alchemist. The opening has an amazing song. The soundtrack is very nice too. The show has a dub, and it isn't that bad of a dub. Overall I enjoyed this anime very much. I recommend this to anime beginners as it has a very nice and understandable
                  story. It also has the theme of superhero's which might be easier for beginner anime watchers to grasp. But at the same time seasoned anime watchers could engoy this anime as it has well written character depth and 8/10.",8,NamelessWeeb

                I've heard it suggested that Boku no Hero Academia takes after western comic books more than Shonen anime. I don't think that's accurate. From the humor to the themes to the structure, most of what happens in this show would not be out of place in Naruto. Not the least ""Japanese"" element is the fact that it's set in a highly competitive, oddly specialized school.
That's not necessarily an insult, but if you've seen a lot of anime you'll probably find this one a bit tired and predictable. Its central theme is that anyone can do great things with sufficient effort, which is fine, but a
                  bit played out by now. The interactions between Deku and Katsuki certainly resemble - once again - parts of Naruto's dynamic with Sasuke or Neji.
Naruto fans will also recognize the use of flashbacks. Besides the minute-long recaps at the start of every episode, Boku no Hero flashes back to previous scenes with alarming frequency. This is one of a few techniques that I suspect were used to save time on animation: although the fight scenes are fluid and well-animated, there's a lot of dialog set over mostly static backgrounds.
The early episodes are slow-paced and repetitive. The show quickly settles into a rigid formula: a problem occurs and Deku is helpless, but he saves the day in the end by doing something reckless, usually at a steep cost to himself. Almost every single time, the reckless thing he does is using One For All.
Deku is probably the biggest problem with the anime. He's not the least interesting character (that would be Ochako,) but he reacts the same way to most things: with fear followed by heroism. It really gets old watching him act so weak again and again, when you know he'll pull himself together and win in a few minutes. Katsuki is a better character. His personality is exaggerated and grating, but he's got some admirable traits to balance things out and I'm interested to see how he will develop in the later seasons. I like the idea behind the genesis of his hatred for the protagonist.
Some of the others students are interesting. I especially like the kid with the head of a crow. A subtly cool moment occurs during the mock battles, when he walks into the building in his cloak, followed by his shadow. It's framed in a way that gives him a sense of presence. Unfortunately, we don't see much of these characters. I expect they'll get more screen-time in the later episodes of what I expect to be quite a long-running series. This first season is only scratching the surface, and it shows.
All Might is the real standout character. He's a lot of fun and he has vulnerabilities that make him compelling. Eraserhead is less interesting, but one of the highlights of the season is an action sequence focused on him.
While the school drama is tedious, Boku no Hero becomes more interesting when the real world breaks in and the students have to face it. Half of this season is devoted to an engaging multi-character battle featuring two creatively designed, sufficiently creepy villains. Those episodes are ultimately what make the show worth it. However, I can't help but feel that it would've been a better narrative decision to make this season a little darker. The way it plays out makes it seem like the scenario was contrived to protect the characters from harsh consequences, which would've been more appropriate in a show aimed at little kids rather than teenagers.
I can understand why Boku no Hero Academia is popular. A lot of mediocre Shonen anime come out every year and it's clearly a cut above that pack. Is it as good as the now-complete ""Big Three"" or something like Dragon Ball? My inclination is no, but let's be fair and wait until it has a few hundred episodes to judge.",7,Evillordexdeath

                ( Before I continue, let me just say that this my opinion. NOT a fact. Thank you)
Boku no hero academia is a very good anime. It has good character development, interesting art style, and awesome soundtracks. Even though I like this anime, there are also some downsides as well.
Good parts: 
One good things about this anime is the message. Although some may say that the message, anyone can become a hero, is corny and a bit unrealistic, I found this to be very inspiring and heartwarming. In other words you don't really need to have powers or capes to be a hero. Just lending a
                  helping hand to anyone in trouble is good enough.
The characters are also pretty decent as well. Sadly, the series only concentrates on Deku, Bakugo, and All Might so far. The other characters are yet to be explored thoroughly but they do have a lot of potential so I hope that as the series goes on,  we would learn most of the character's personality and reasons for wanting to be a hero.
For me personally, I just adore the art style. It's rough like sketches and thick outlines matches the superhero like theme very well. Also, the action scene in episode 12 was just amazing. (No spoilers) 
BTW, can I mention that the ost for Boku no hero academia like ""Say you Run"" and ""You can be a Hero"" is like a 10/10. It really conveys the emotions of the current scenes and makes you think you're actually inside of the anime. I tip my hat to you Porno Graffiti.
This show also has good pacing. Every time each episode ended, it made me want to see more of it and just when I thought nothing interesting can come out of the current episode, something new and exciting comes out in the end that makes me wanna see more.
Bad parts:
The premise of Boku no hero academia has been used many times. The idea about how the world gets super power and stuff  just gets repetitive at times and this show is no exception but how they handled the details and such made this show worth while.
Also the trope,"" I want to be a hero""  is a bit cliche. It's basically every goal of every shounen main character ever.
I sorta did found Deku's character a bit annoying and jarring. He cries literally every two seconds and he gets nervous about everything, but these type of characters are luckily not overused. This creates an opportunity to make the character grow stronger each passing day, so when you look back at how far he/she developed, you feel somewhat satisfied. 
I give this show a 9 out of 10 which I may have gave it more credit than it deserves but this is my final conclusion. Hope you liked this review!!!",9,archanic24

                Honestly... I don't think boku no hero is good. But before you click of this review I do enjoy the show and I do think this is worth watching. The show is inspired by american superhero comics e.g Marvel and DC. I think the basis of why the main point of the show (Quirks) *This part may contain spoilers* They are lazily explained in my reason and im not sure if its just laziness or it is planned to be explained in the future. Quirks were said to have just appeared 4 generations prior to the start of the show which I definately think is
                  a lazy reason but moving on. I did enjoy this show and you can tell that it is just a test to see if people will enjoy the show. This is probably why the first season only has 12 episodes whereas all the other seasons have over 20. I thoroughy enjoyed the othr seasons but i think the outcome of the entrance exam to the last episode is very predictable and repetitive. 
I know all I have done in this review is roast the show but I do think its worth watching. It has pretty good animation but its worth watching mainly to enjoy the other 4 seasons (as of now).",6,DylanPalmer

                Boku no Hero Academia Season 1 Review
Dated: September 24, 2019
Plot: 
Honestly, I never thought this anime was good. I really have no interest in trending anime's and this series is one of them. For me, trending animes is just an overrated one. Well, not all I guess. Trying to find some good action anime in youtube, I've come to watch the fight between Midoriya and Todoroki. And because Todoroki looks so cool, I tried watching the first episode, and the next one, and the next one. And I got hooked up. 
This anime is about heroes and future heroes. The setting is a world where
                  different skills or powers can be discovered in a human being and they can, if they like it, may want to become a hero. Our MC wanted to become one, wanted it in desperation. However, he was born with nothing. Nothing at all. Thus, his journey of having no skill but wanting to become a hero will begin once he encounters the best hero of all, the one he admires so much. 
Characters:
Useless characters are so out of date, and I'm really glad it is. Useless is different than weakness. Every character has weakness; they should be. That's where they have a room to grow; that's where character development takes place. Useless characters are just so annoying. The MC is yes, weak, but he have so much potential and intensity in him. He has that goal he wanted and the will to reach it. Side note, I really like the character of Aizawa, he is so cool. 
Sound and Animation: 
The voice of Bakugo is so intense. He's one of those characters who's so childish, but you can't help but like. There are characters whose really cute, there are those that are cool and then, there are characters that are somewhat weird. And I think, that's just right since heroes are not the same. It is what makes it unique. 
Enjoyment: 
I love it. I so much like how the anime goes. The actions are exciting, the pacing is just right, not too fast and not too slow, just right. It will make you excited on what's come next. It will let you hope that all of them will grow and wanted to watch them do so. 
Ending: 
The ending of season 1 is just a warm up. It just made the characters realize that what they wanted is not a joke. It's like letting them re-think what they are trying to reach and how serious they are to achieve it. It is also the introduction of the antagonist of the story. Not some cheap one who always get destroyed but just a warning sign that something more horrible are just around the corner.",10,KyasutoNaito

                Watch it if you enjoy action scenes and high-quality graphics. Watch it if you like marvel/DC and all the other blockbuster movies.
 My Hero Academy started a new era in the Anime industry. The era of looks but no substance. The era of no conviction is needed because a hero needs to be a hero and a villain simply is a villain. The honest score for this anime is 6, however, I gave it 3 because it showed the industry how to be mainstream and how to print money without trying too hard. The formula is otherworldly animation and VA and that's all there is
                  to it.
Again this anime( and its future seasons which I'm not going to write a review for because they're pretty much the same) is not bad, but it was made purely for entertainment, it's made so you don't need to think just enjoy the allure of the coloring and quality of the frames. An anime just like all the blockbuster movies we see Hollywood make each year. Also, show some respect towards women. It's ok for women to have characters of their own and not be just a support to the MC.",3,pedram_foroughi

                Ok,my hero academia is a pretty wierd anime,why I say that,bcause is overrated but also is underrated.People say is overrated because is overrated and he have a pretty trash fandom and is underrated because is not that bad like people say and is a good anime when you are bored,if the main character was a interesting persona from first and was not a stupid shy persona and side characters were not made for 12y.o. who think trashkugo is hot this anime can even be one really good overlooking fandoom.The fandom is pretty trash because are just personas who ships andults with childs who are under
                  10y.o. and another wierd and stupid personas who overestimate midoria,the another part of normal mha fans are the normal ones,this fans just watch the show and thats it,and the last fandom part is the one who think Endevoar didnt nothing wrong,if you watched berserk ""Endevoar didnt nothing wrong"" is like ""Griffith didnt nothing wrong"" I mean,he is nr.2 hero and he abused his childrens and his wife and people think he is now a good guy just because he tell his son that he will be a hero of which he can be pround,this is like I kill a persona and after that I say sorry and I am forgiven.This anime have a pretty wierd logic,before you say this anime is trash because you dont like the fandom,watch it,but dont begin be a femboy.",7,papandau5566

                I gave this show an 8, but it was a bit generous. Although it is entertaining, the show can be very childish. I feel like it would've been so much better if
1. They didn't have people fanboy over cape wearing super heroes
2. They villains didn't call themselves the ""Villains League""
3. There weren't silly quirks that changed people's appearances as a whole and made them non-human. They're supposed to be normal humans with powers, not genetically modified mutants. 
I enjoyed watching this but a lot of the silliness ruined it for me. I feel like the show doesn't know what age it's trying to target. Sometimes

                Nothing bad but also nothing so special about this whole series. Its good and thats it. Unlike any other shonen series, MHA story felt too plain and simple. Maybe its only my preference to like anime with complex and deep story but MHA in term of story didnt intrigue me much. 
But not gonna lie the animation is dope and soundtracks used were really awesome and match the situation. OP/ED is also synced well with the story theme. I can say for now MHA has the chance to be the new face of new generation shonen series but no doubt that it still nowhere close

                (SPOILER FREE REVIEW)
Story (5): As someone who's seen a fair amount of shonen, the narrative of BNHA doesn't do anything particularly new for the genre, nor even among the subtype of hero-based anime. The initial idea that one day people suddenly started getting powers and choose to become 'heros' and 'villains' isn't the focus and isn't explored further, leading the plot to focus almost entirely on the high school life of its cast with few external villain appearances intermixed. Needless to say, if you're looking for a more inventive shonen story world the pickings are plentiful elsewhere, and the character tropes here are so generic
                  to the point that any experienced shonen/anime viewer has likely seen them done better and many times before elsewhere, and in a far less predictable and formulaic manner.
Animation and Style (10): The art of BNHA is by far its best element, with a crisp, consistent, and clean style accompanied by a huge and well implemented budget. Action scenes are the highlight of the show, with punchy loud and effective visuals, my hat goes off to the effects artists on this project and to the original magaka for such a visually pleasing animated series.
Music/Sound (9): The music of this show is effective and generally above average, working to build hype during tense or active scenes, with a banger first OP and solid ED to boot. The voice acting is also on point, capturing each character very well, the protagonist Deku and his rival Bakugou both standing out as amazing performances, Bakugou's VA in specific really carrying his scenes with his performance. Very little to dislike here from an audio standpoint.
Characters (6): I'll be frank, the fandom around this show is quite vocal about which characters they like and dislike, etc., so giving an objective opinion can be difficult without an uproar. What I will say is that upon completing season 1, I didn't like any characters particularly, though I rather aggressively disliked Deku, due to his generic and boring personality that lacks any uniqueness among his shonen peers. The characters in this show improve a lot and grow as the series progresses, but that isn't super apparent until late season two and beyond, so for the first season in specific here, don't go in expecting anything that breaks the mold for a shonen cast.
Enjoyment (7): I generally enjoyed this show, despite a notable element I will place here [skip the Enjoyment section to avoid a minor ep2 spoiler]. Deku being introduced as one of the few characters with no super power initially in a world surrounded by heroes made me quite hopeful this show would be unique, giving me a sense that lacking powers could be a metaphor for disability or other inherent obstacles that make your life and ambitions harder -- I was very excited to see a protagonist who was specialized in collecting information and strategy surrounded by more typically physically powerful peers/heroes. However, instead of Deku using his inherent skills to find a clever or unique work around, the show opts to break its own pre-established rules that you either have a power or do not, and has a hero coincidentally have one of the only powers you can give to another person. The power he receives is the most powerful we're aware of at this point, and turns him from a promising and genuine underdog into a normal overpowered protagonist, with his only obstacle being his own incompetence/inexperience in utilizing his new near limitless powers.
Overall (7): This shonen is generally rather bland from the characters to the plot itself, not doing too much interesting outside of that. The main things that really pull me in are highlights in later seasons, the voice acting, and the visuals -- if the animation and action visuals aren't to your taste, however, I doubt there's much else here to carry your experience or to provide something new in the current saturated shonen genre.",7,Aquatics

                When all seemed lost, Boku no Hero saved me from the abyss
To start i'll explain that i'm not a fan of Shonens never had and i thought i never will but Boku no Hero has been the exception. Now like an anime called Re:Zero i was going to give this anime a pass but thanks to some pestering from friends i watched this series and boy i'm glad.
Unlike every other shonen I've watch i like the main character, Deku is great to watch the way he figures out how to get passed every obstacle he faces. Even all the side characters are a joy to
                  have on screen.
Like other Shonens Boku no Hero uses arcs though the arcs in Boku no Hero are much smaller which i think makes them much more enjoyable to watch as the pacing doesn't feel bloated unlike other Shonens that take 50 episodes for the protagonist to get their and another 20 to kill the villain.
Boku no Hero is climbing the charts so eventually if your a non Shonen guy like me you probably gonna end up watching so why not start it now",9,Noel_Phantasm

                My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Academia is a Shonen Jump manga series created by Kohei Horikoshi. It was inspired by American comic books, particularly DC and Marvel Comics. Let's get to the review, shall we?
Story: The series is all about Izuku Midoriya, a superhero fanatic who dreams of becoming a hero if he develops a Quirk. But a sudden turn of events, he ended up lacking one but everything changes when he met his all time favorite hero, All Might, in person.  Later, he is destined to inherit All Might's power, One For All. The series story is a coming of age story with
                  a zero to hero concept since it shows how Izuku progresses from being a zero to a future hero. There are also laughs and running gags that make us laugh very hard.
Characters: There are many characters with different personalities like Izuku himself being a determined and passionate although he originally didn't have a Quirk and tries his best to save people even though the person is a bully like Bakugo or not like most characters. Just like the most comic book series, there are villains (League of Villains) gives color to the series similar to Rogues' Gallery or Legion of Doom.
Art and Animation: Bones, the animation studio that brings you Fullmetal Alchemist series and Heroman, gives the heroic and comic feeling in their animations like All Might's smashes. 
Sound: The series' music is the best giving the superhero feeling to most superhero fanatics. The opening ""The Day"" by Porno Graffitti is super awesome and I get an LSS upon hearing it.
Enjoyment: The series is super enjoyable to watch despite mixed reviews by most critics. Now I'm watching the second season. ""Go Beyond! PLUS ULTRA!!!""",9,The_Anonymous28

                Would I be lying if I said that this is the most controversial anime in recent times? Just enter this section and you realize what I'm talking about, several bad and rare notes that are good. I'm going to counter that and also give it a good grade, but on the other hand, I'm not going to turn a blind eye to script flaws, especially this season.
History (7): One thing I have to agree, the history of BNHA is anything but groundbreaking, at least before they changed their appeal. The weakest child is chosen by the greatest hero to be his successor and even helps
                  him get into the young hero's college and blah blah blah! Basically Harry Potter, with a bit of Batman and Robin. What always saved that part for me was the development of minor characters like Bakugou (I'm not a fan of his) and Iida and the student-master relationship between All Might and Deku.
Art (9): Undoubtedly one of the best shounen designs! All characters are cute, unique and square. I wanted to live in a world like that!
Sound (8): Lmao, is pleasing to my ears.
Character (8): All Might is the best and that's a fact! But I also like Midoriya, Iida, Kirishima, Shoto, Uraraka, Momo and you probably will too if you have common sense. Jokes aside, it's thanks to this group of characters and Bakugou too that the series is successful, remove them and you'll see how boring it would be. It would be up to Mineta, Aoyama and even the Nomus to occupy the space... I throw in the towel!
Enjoyment (9): I truly feel more satisfied with Japanese superhero adaptations than Western ones.
Overall (10): ""Just believe in yourself, and you can become a hero!""",8,O_Anticults

                A generic storyline with a generic main character set in a generic world. 
We have a weak but determined hero with a strong sense of justice who has to go through tough training while earning respect from his peers (learning the 'power of friendship' along the way). The fights are broken up constantly by the characters analyzing every strike for 30 seconds, the hero’s shout the names of their attacks... you get the idea. The amount of Shounen clichés is set to overkill in MHA, there's no suspense or wonder within because every part of it is so cut and dried. This was like a
                  bad re-tread of all the Shounen series I've sat through.
You know what the worst part was? How it made me feel like I was an idiot. I know I'm a bit older than the 13+ age group this is aimed at but having every part of a character’s actions completely spelled out for me was just plain annoying. I didn't need to have Deku's inner thoughts tell me what another character is doing or thinking when I can clearly tell just by my own eyes or by recalling the events of, you know, the previous episode.
Moving away from the negativity, the presentation was fine and I did like the over-the-top character design. It was goofy and embraced it. And as stock as he was I did like the All Might character, I thought he was the highlight of the show. To its credit, this was at least watchable and there's nothing particularly offensive about it; hence why I'm being kind here by giving it a 5. There's at least some potential shown here, enough to make me consider giving Season 2 a try.",5,Ghost-Hardware

                Boku No Hero Academia follows the journey of a young boy trying to achieve the dream of becoming a hero, inspiring his ideal from the top hero that ever exist: All Might.
However, this young boy is quirkless, which means that he doesn't possess any powers at all compare to his school where he is the only one in that case. Even tainted by the bullying he is getting from his idea of becoming a hero despite his situation, he isn't giving up and even met All Might, the person who saved him.
 But after a harsh discussion between the two and learning the dark secret
                  behind All Might and his life situation, All might clearly state that only being a police officer would fit for his cases. Izuku Midoriya who will be the main character if the story didn't give up and even tried to save someone who was bullying him the most since school from a villain who couldn't be beaten by any pro heroes present on the scene.  Thinking about his books, he had the idea of throwing his backpack which clearly shows that this short kid definitely knows how to make up strategy in a crucial moment. All Might, who was scared to jump in finally accepted it thanks to the kid who shows him how a hero must work works and gave him back the spirit he had before.
And that is where it all started. Despite the blame he received from the pro heroes, he saved the spirit of All Might and he gave him his power because hence All Might possess a power that can pass through the generation and he deemed Izuku as the next successor of ""One For All.""
Story: 8
The only flaw of Boku No Hero Academia would be the story which is basically isn't what make how much popular the anime is. Sure it's heartwarming a lot and the cliffhanger are there, but it's just a normal story of someone becoming a hero. But that doesn't mean it's bad! The way they pull it off make it extremely enjoyable along the flashbacks that are placed well and not too much, not overflooding the anime.
Art: 10
The visual of BNHA is remarkable. They are matching well with the sounds impact, as well as being colorful, flashy and we can clearly understand what is happening even when things are moving extremely fast like in a battle or a crucial moment. When there are some comedy scenes the face drawn are well funny or even cute during some occasions. The model of each character are well made and the little details they put, like when someone is doing a fist, their eyes and facial features reacting toward the action make it even greater. There is a lot of details here and there that make the visual enjoyment even better. 
The opening is awesome and hype me a lot. The angles and movements they are doing with the camera is lovely along the amazing transitions (Like when Izuku start running on the screen and the background suddenly change)
Sound: 10
Nothing more to add apart from the fact that they are awesome to hear. They are placed when needed and not abused.
Character: 10
The character development in this anime is really one of its strongest points. Even with the flood of characters Bones did manage to show off each character's personality and powers well. 
Enjoyment: 10
Extremely pleasant to watch. It's great and did satisfy my taste well.

                the story is quite interesting. the art style is also pretty unique. I'm a fan of the soundtrack as well. I like most of the characters as well, they're all pretty cool. except for one: mineta. I get that he's there as a satirical character, but he's not even funny. all the ""funny"" scenes involving him are just uncomfortable. the series would've been way better if he wasn't in it. if it weren't for mineta, I'd enjoy it a lot more. overall, it's an alright anime, but I've seen better.

                Warning, some spoilers are included in this review!!
Story (9): A great story about following your dreams, no matter what anyone says, and never giving up on it. Following Deku's road from believing in himself and overcoming obstacles (his mother's words ""I'm sorry"" and Kacchan's bullying) was very heart-pinching.
Art (9): Cool fight scenes, though I haven't seen many anime with this many fight scenes, so I might not be a good grader in this category. I like the style of the characters. The style of each character kind of resembles how they are. Kacchan has angry eyes and spiky hair - resembling his aggressive tendencies -
                  while Deku seems more innocent and soft with his fluffy green hair and wide eyes.
Sound (10): Damn, how awesome the OP sounded after a few episodes. Still have it stuck in my head. The kind of upbeat songs when they had tests/tryouts and fighting were very fitting and kind of made me want to jump with the beat LOL.
Character (9): Loved every character, but Uraraka made me annoyed for some reason. She just seemed so simple, and it felt like she wasn't shown for anything but to look cute. I hope I'll get to know her as more unique in the second season... That's the thing about most characters in this series - they're unique. The powers each of the students had in Deku's class were crazily original, too, some of them almost laughable. But it was great.
Enjoyment (9): Couldn't stop watching after I had begun, and now I'm eager to begin the next season. Watching every character defeat villains, fight against each other, and other stuff was the most enjoyable part of the series, apart from seeing Deku's relationship with All Might or Kacchan develop through the series.
Overall (9): Although it was really great, some things were missing, though I'm not good enough to point my finger exactly to what. It's like when you compare this anime to how you felt watching another that you thought was even better, but you can't compare them and say why the other was better. Something like that. Anyway, My Hero Academia was a great watch!",9,ciaovatos

                I had high expectations on this anime, everyone that I knew recommended it and it seemed a good show. It surely is, but it's a bit overrated. Let's start with the story: very funny at first, it soon becomes more mature (still in shonen canons), but it's too foregone at times. Anyways, watching this show you will not feel like wasting your time.
The art is well done and it stands out among the other shows, that have pretty well the same style. I personally think that suits well the story and I appreciate this ""diversity"".
The sound is also good. The voice actors are nailed, and
                  (except bokuto and other ones) they suit their character pretty well. The openings and endings are amazing, they really entice you to watch this anime.
The characters are built poorly, they feel fake. I thought this show could break some shonen canons, like the ""bad characters"" (the antagonists) that are bad just because (Bokuto), or the week guy who suddenly becomes strong and everything (Midoriya). Well, this show has them both! But there are also good ones, like todoroki, who has a troubled past, or Shigaraki, a mysterious and even crazy personality. The creators surely could have depth more issues through characters. 
Then, we have the enjoyment, and I can say that I really did. Boku no hero academia is a must-watch shonen, the plot is funny and light and with its numbers made history. I got really passionate to this series but, I have to debunk a myth: this is not the greatest anime of all times, and will never be. Watch it if you like the genre and if you're looking for a light storyline that grows deep every episode.
Also, we haven't seen the end of the series yet, and maybe my opinion will change. But until then, these are my grades:

                First of all...the most negative thing that I found about this series is that it's story is boring af. I have seen a lot of shonen at this point, but this is the most boring shonen I have ever encountered. But still I have given it a 7 and it is because of the other aspects. For example, its art style and animation is very good, the fight scenes are great and music is good too. Characters are not that great...the only character I liked in this entire series is All Might. The majority of criticism this show gets is due to its story. You
                  can watch it if you don't care much about the plot. Since I am a weeb...I am not gonna drop the show no matter how bad it is. So yeah..I will continue watching it and hope its story improves in future.",7,AniManga_Boy07

                Boku no hero is a really well done shounen anime, with a variety of casts that have relatable struggles and their own unique personalities. I love the entire cast of 1A, even mineta (pls get a redemption arc). Deku's struggle to achieve his dreams and his entire journey is one most youths these days can relate to and I certainly do.
 It is a tale of hot blooded passion and achieving your dreams, but also goes into world building and is not afraid to portray the reality of their society that mimics ours and shows that there are flaws, it is not perfect, but even
                  so, you make do with what you have.

                This is a very good show. The story is basically your typical shonen story, however I always say that execution is key. Not execution like murdering people obviously. I mean it doesn't matter how basic your story sounds on paper.  It's how you present and develop this story that makes it stand out. How you execute it. The story is simple enough, about a kid who has no superpowers in a world where everyone has superpowers, and he wants to be the greatest superhero. Wow I wonder how long it took to come up with that. But then, as I watched, I found that
                  the writer continuously found ways to make this simple plot very entertaining and stand out. Its nothing tooooo special, but I think there is room for something a bit more original to go with the good writing.
The animation is good. Nothing really that special. In comparison to other anime, it does not stand out. There are some well animated scenes which cannot be said due to spoilers rip, but yeah just take my word, I know what I'm talking about I think. The backgrounds are awful though. I can't tell if they were just going for a certain style or if they were trying to match the style of the manga or something (which I haven't read so I don't know what it looks like in the manga) but they did something wrong there.
The music is good. I like 'you say run', but that is the only one I can remember. Otherwise, the music is quite bland.
The characters are very good. Obviously I cannot go into details due to spoilers, but there is some good character stuff happening here. Midoriya is good. His design is good and his personality is good and his development is good. A good character really. All might as well is great. He is just so fun to watch and his personality is very good. I also find myself liking Bakugo a lot too. There are also many characters in this season who do not get a lot of screen time, but are still good as supporting characters. They all have unique powers too so that is cool.
I enjoyed this show. Far from the best, at least season 1 is, but not bad. Not bad at all. I give it a 8/10. Solid show. Do recommend.

Animation is good, character design is unequal, music is lame, scenario is unroriginal.
BUT this is very enjoyable, because the rythm is good.
You don't waste too much time on subplots, the crying sessions are not too long and overall, there's a great sense of humour. It feels like the anime is aware of its own clichés.
Remember when Naruto was good (a long long time ago), well this is exactly the same story with mutants. (no spoiler)

                This a review of all 5 season of my hero academia
This show was hype up and considered as a gold standard of fighting shounen it has a theme of super hero that you can casually find in western comics and has a school setting and being a super hero is like a job or profession by enrolling a prestigious academy 
It has a good animation and a mediocre sound track
This type of the show is only appealing to the fojushi, casual anime watchers and didn't watch much anime and like it because of the premise and considered it as fresh,special,better and masterpiece 
But if you
                  see it time to time the anime become downhill and the manga
The fans didn't bother until there's a fighting 
And here's a list of the problem that proven the crap it was all along
1.destined to be no.1 this show has no tension since the mc narrating the whole show and openly said that he will become the no.1 hero in the end
Of the series why will people watch the show thats spoiled the very ending 
this means the whole show is full of fake suspense
2.too much plot convenient the show over use this shit 
Like in when deku saves hes bully so that he looks heroic in the eyes of people
The hero exam is meaningless since besides of defeating the robot there's other way to gain points its means its favoritism because all might want deku to pass so that his successor can enroll in the school 
3.the fighting is dull its just punching and standstill the animation team makes it amazing by using flashy effects but if you think it there's no strategy involved
 heck the mc use 1000000% of power that is complete asspull power up
4.heroism the show use points to determined if you are better or a worthy to become hero by passing test
Im gonna say it heroism is a trait not ambition or a goal
There's a a character that wants to become hero because she wants a money ""uraraka""
There's who want to become popular ""mineta""
There's even a bully who wants to be a hero""bakugo""
5.idiot mc deku write every powers and weaknesses of other hero so that he can countered it but he didn't even used it and use the power of one for all heck he didn't even know how to kick until season 3
6.bulliying why deku just kissing bakugo ass he didn't even try to defend his self and idolize this maniac bully as if his a wife that was very happy when his husband kick his ass
7.op mc besides of super strength deku has another 6 quirk that kill the tension of the show 
8.boring side characters most of the side characters are one note and have one type of personality
9.nepotism deku wants to become hero and didn't even try to become one heck he even practice his body when all might promised that he will pass his power 
10.crappy world building it has a themes of having a superpower when the child was born it means the world also change but as you can see it have a mandane setting so its means its suck
11.not  punished the villain get constantly gets punished by the heroes but the heroes also made some terrible things like bakugo he was a maniac bully he should be not accept in the hero academy 
Endeavor he made many terrible things to his wife and children but he didn't punished besides of having a scar on his face it means its double standards
12.bad pacing it has an arc of super dangerous and have a world level threat of villain and then the next arc it was about silly tournament or training about bunch of kids who play sports or visiting their rooms
13.flashback over 9000 especially in the 4th season it constantly have a flashback that interrupt the plot and the fighting for every 2 mins it even have an sitting in the table and infodumping about of how they feels
14.re-cap ep its mostly have a long recap ep or introduction in the beginning of the show especially in the 4th and 5th season it even constantly showing the powers of the characters that the viewer should know in the the first 2 season of the series
15.trying = winning mentality just as i as said deku lost almost all of test but he was favored by the instructor and allmight to pass because he really tried 
Thats  was  bs mentality of this show saying that as long a we try we can have all the things we want
As you can see i provide all the good things and the problems of this show And my verdict is this show is bad and promote retarded mentality 
The writing of this show is on par of fairytail one of the bottom of the barrel fighting shounen",4,Katomegumi_10

                My Hero Academia is a rather controversial show, with many claiming it to either be hot trash or a masterpiece. With the first season, I believe that while not being the most original or fresh idea shonen has seen, it's still a very solid introduction.
The plot is quite formulaic with tropes that are done way too many times, but it still maintains charming and fresh enough (at least for the first season). It is quite fast paced, and it doesn't waste time meandering too much.
Deku is likable for the most part, being someone you would root for and has much potential for growth. Cast of
                  supporting characters are quirky and interesting, world is intriguing with an ambiguous societal hierarchy and offers a lot of potential to explore interesting subject matters like discrimination. School setting is utilised well, with the concept of a hero school being quite interesting. 
The Art style is cartoony in a good way, and it is aesthetically very appealing to see. Animation is very solid, and fight scenes look fluid and aesthetically pleasing, as expected of studio bones. Ost is not bad, makes you hype and emotional. 
It's shonen done right. Good introduction to the series, and very nice gateway anime to newcomers.",7,Fguyretftgu7

                Boku no hero academia, more like boku no pico lmao. its this pretty overrated imo anime. Allow me to explain why
Story:
about some dude called Deku who wants to be a hero, because they're cool. he takes the big hero, all might's dna inside him orally and gains the power to break his bones. then he tries to replace the big guy because he is fucking old. 
he then tries to train inorder to become the greatest hero, because again he thinks its cool and just wants to save people because yes. its pretty generic if you ask me, but i'm glad they didn't 100% focus
                  on the protag.
Art:
the villain designs are pretty cool. shigaragi has some cool hands, but what is cooler is the rest of the design. other villains are designed pretty sick too. some heroes look pretty nice and the animation overall was done well I guess. the clouds being animated well brings a tear to my eye because of the nostalgia. just hits different after season 4.
sound:
cool music for both sides imo. the clouds make no sound tho, that's kinda boring. the villains definitely deserved a bit better music, but still good i gues. the sound effects were pretty nice for once, especialy for a generic shounen anime. 
characters:
I kinda put it out already, but deku is super boring crybaby. like yeah he got bullied, but that his fault for being cringe. Shigaragi is pretty based and cool overall with his decay power and shit. The rest of characters are ok,but I really like todoroki and bakugo. other hero characters are ok I guess and villains are interestijng and cool written.
enjoyment:
I didnt really enjoy the show that much in the end. I came in for the cool villains, but decided to give it a shot as in try the other seasons too. still kinda overrated anime. if you like this anime, then i guess do that, but I think it's a bit shit, full offense jk.
the other seasons are bit more worth watching than this one, so I guess i'd recommend skipping unless this is your thing or some shit. 4/10, would roll in mud.",4,Lonely_Blade

                A Shounen protagonist not obsessed with eating? Thats Boku no Hero Academia for you the anime about a young man named Izuku Midoriya who lives in a superhero fueled society where everyone has powers with the exception of him. But his Idol the number 1 hero of japan/the world(they never explain) All Might can help him out. 
The series has its very own style of animation almost mimicing western silver age comics. From the shading, bold lines, flashy costumes its very fun to watch and is great at catching your attention on what you should focus on. Almost every character has a moment where they
                  pose and the announcer screams about them and their power and its all good fun. Now the action is also well animation and doesn't really drag on as much as you'd expect from a Shounen series. Each fight is also really interesting to watch. Each are so good at mixing in their powers to the fights. And in creative ways. Theres this one kid whose palm sweat is like napalm and they literally show all the creative things he can do with it and the potential he has. And deffinatly watch for the fight in episode 11 its very intense and is personally one of the best.
The characters have their good moments and their bad. Izuku is very different from your typical angry protagonist that shoots first asks questions later. He's kind of a crybaby. And its nice to see something different. And its not just he cry for no reason they show he's had his share of rough times, so he's got reasons to be emotional. This also this aura of him that really makes you want to see him succeed and I actually found myself growing attached to him watching the first episode. All Might is probably the best character. He starts off looking so bland as your typical one dimensional honerable brute, but that changes is seconds after you meet him. He's still a nice guy and as the show progresses you really start to see his relationship with Izuku bloom. But hes still the kids mentor he can be harsh with him, at times. He kind of has a weirdly sassy attitude about certain things. The best part is he has so much depth to him yet he always has this heroic grin. Its like that guy at a shop whose constantly smiling while trying to convince a customer they dont sell that brand no matter how much their soul is about to collapse. It leads to great comedy.
 Even the side characters are nice, the little gravity girl, the class rep, Izuku's homeroom teachers. Each on the surface are basic Shounen stereotypes but are still enough of their own thing that theyre interesting to watch and id like to see more of them. The only complaints with characters is id like more of the extras in his class. These kids have cool and fun designs id like to see them do more/ emphasized more on their goals. Theres a kid who has six arms that sprout faces, this one girl has pink skin and looks kind of like a moth, one of them is a timid looking rock monster and I really want to know more about all of them. And I have to say im not a fan if Izuku's rival the exploding sweat kid. He has such a terrible attitude to him, to say his personality is just screaming is an understatement. So id either like to see improvement from him or less of him entirly.
Either way its not only good Shounen but good story either way.",9,kaizoku-okubey

                Boku no Hero Academia - Is it better to be born great, or to become great?
As I'm writing this review, I've seen many complaints that this series has a childish plot and that it's too derivative of comics. I should begin by dispelling those notions, because I worry I won't get anywhere I want to if I don't. As a huge comic book nerd, I can assure you that it's not the most derivative superhero series I've ever seen and that of course you're going to think it's childish - everyone thinks superheroes are, to a degree, childish. They run around, fight evil, and wear
                  tight, bright and colorful jumpsuits.
So, I guess if you can't get over that, this series probably isn't for you.
At its core it feels like a love letter to the X-Men and western comics, and furthermore, a spiritual successor to Jojo's Bizzare Adventure. I can see why all the MHA fans ""migrated"" to JJBA - they share the same creative/analytical fight styles where almost anything can happen and you'll still suspend your disbelief. I find that very entertaining, but I can certainly understand if it's not your thing.
Still, I find that time and time again people are going to immediately discount it because it seems ""immature"" or ""childish"". I don't think that's a legitimate complaint - childishness and quality are too separate things. It might not be for you, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Are you seriously going to go knock a Pokemon or Mario game out of someone's hands because it's not ""mature"" enough?
And, once again, I repeat, this is a superhero story. On the outside, they all look childish. Batman is a guy who dresses up as a bat, for Christ's sake - if you stop when you see his appearance, you miss the point entirely. You need to dig deeper. You need to look thematically.
That's the part of My Hero Academia that was the strongest for me. It could be just another superhero story, but it's not. I find that it actually takes a quite investigative look at what being a hero actually means, especially in a world where everyone is powerful. At the core of the series lies the question: what makes a hero, and within that question, is it better to become a hero (All Might, Todoroki) or to have been born to be a hero (Nomu, Kacchan)?
As much as I like the quirk of ""spontaneous mutant powers"", that does have a certain eugenic connotation to it. The X-Men are great, but if you strip away the societal stigma, you get what Magneto is saying: some of us are just plain better than other people.
I was very cautious that this series would go down that road. The other alternative wasn't much better, either - what if Midoriya just doesn't get a superpower, and we get some intellectual b.s. that's all ""well his power is being such a great leader and being so smart on the battlefield!"" That's not the case, luckily. The series manages to somewhat cover the topic surprisingly gracefully in the first few episodes.
When Todoroki asks if you have to be superpowered to be a hero, All Might initially can't answer. It's a tough reality - in a world full of super danger, a regular person is just going to be a liability, aren't they? But, as the show goes on to teach, it's not just about being born great, it's about putting the work in. Luck is certainly a present factor - that's an inescapable quality of reality and as the show states, no one is born equal - but the show seems to hopefully suggest that we can all self-improve into better, stronger, and more competent people.
And, furthermore, just because you might have the right friends, the right powersets, and the right environment, it doesn't mean you're a hero. It's not all just effort into being powerful. Eraser Head constantly reminds the class that creativity and control (i.e., restraint, extension, adaptability) are the two most important factors.
Take Kacchan and Todoroki: outside of ""One-For-All"", they easily have some of the most powerful quirks. They're especially vindictive and are constantly on the precipice of good morality. You get the sense that if they were fighting for the wrong reasons, they would easily be considered some of the most brutal villains in their world. They walk the thin line.
If I have any serious complaints, it would probably be here. Most of the villains are one-note. The show does a much better job at comparative/competitive hero relationships than ""hero versus villain"" relationships. 
My other main gripe is that the episodes seem to blur together. If you're binging them, you're going to end up watching the same scene back-to-back. It's a Shonen, though, so I suspect some element of that is to be expected. There are also a lot of characters who I can't pin the names down too well - luckily, only a few characters are actually referred to by name, and you can just give the other characters ""codenames"" in your head. It's pretty apt for the genre. 
But I digress. I should probably answer the question: in the end, what makes a hero? What are the qualities of a hero?
It's not about causing the most property damage, destroying the combat environment, being the most powerful, or martyrdom. Above all else, the superhero's job isn't to be a victor, it's to be a savior: not just of the masses, but of oneself, and most importantly, hope. Even though All Might grows older and weaker (and importantly, doesn't overextend himself except when it's absolutely necessary), he still does what he must to cultivate hope. The subtitles might call him the Symbol of Peace, but to me, as the ultimate hero, he's much more the Symbol of Hope.",8,solmasque

                My Hero Academia is a story about a boy, born without a ""quirk"" (powers) born into a world where almost everyone has quirks that desires to become a hero and his journey towards his goal. As a result he trains hard and does his best to overcome this major setback proving that hard work beats talent! Except... He doesn't... 
He instead shows an act of reckless bravery that could have cost him his life in front of his role model who is a hero and as a result he gains the approval of his long time role model and inherits his powers. While My Hero
                  Academia is not the only shonen anime to be blamed for this stereotype, of a main character who is born with or attains a power and as a result becomes strong, it can be seen to undermine the premise of the story. I believe a main character that is born weak and instead substitutes natural talent for hard work in order to reach his goals would be more enjoyable and prevent this hypocrisy of My Hero Academia's message however this is just my opinion.
While the animation and fight scenes are quite enjoyable, the characters in this anime are quite bland; the main character Izuku Midoriya is a very passive and emotional character, his rival Bakugo is arrogant and violent and throughout the story he can be seen to suffer from Sasuke syndrome where he becomes even more hostile towards Midoriya because he sees him as inferior to him despite Midoriya's success and Todoroki Shouto is a quiet boy who despises his father due to his father's narcissistic behavior and that's it... the rest of the characters have barely any personality. 
Overall I rate it a 7 because despite it's several flaws of mediocore characters and a relatively bland storyline I am still able to enjoy the fluid animation and fight scenes coupled with the praiseworthy soundtrack that that allows the anime to clearly demonstrate acts of courage and portray characters overcoming their limits.",7,Pen_Sharpino

                Ooh, My Hero Academia. One of the most famous animes of all, even your grandma know's about it! I was excited to finally start to watch Boku No Hero, for it being so popular, it must be good, right? Right!
I thoroughly enjoyed watching Boku No Hero. It gets everything right. It's funny, it's action-packed, it's emotional at times and is supported by a nice cast of characters.
Let's start with the animation and music. The opening theme song was amazing! I loved it so much! So full of energy and AH! 10/10 (as of the rest of music, it's good, I guess) And the art and
                  animation in the show is really beautiful and outstanding. It shows so much character and it wouldn't be the same with the unique art style. Lovely.
And the story and characters don't lack behind either! The story is amazingly written, very creative! From the first episode to the last I was hooked! All the episodes were fun and entertaining, I was never really bored. The plot was effective in telling what they wanted to; when it was supposed to be emotional, I felt emotional and it was supposed to be funny, I laughed.
The characters were also very nice and creative, although they may be a little bland, and sometimes the characters, including main characters outside of Midoriya and All Might felt one-sided. But they were all very nice, and most likely will get better fleshed out throughout the show. 
Overall, I would call Boku No Hero Season One a pretty good start! It was very fun to watch and I sure the show will only get better from here! 
Great show!
I give Boku No Hero Season 1 a 7/10.",7,1cherrybomb1

                As a Boku no Hero fan I couldn't leave my profile without a review of each season of this anime.
The first season of boku no hero works extremely well as a character driving, focusing almost entirely on Midoriya's anxiety and insecurity and its contrast with Bakugou's overconfidence. Of course, this makes almost all the other characters like cardboard, but they contain a certain charisma, like those of Re: Zero.
I'll only be able to talk about three persongens for now and some situations. Not that just focusing on 3 characters makes the anime bad, quite the contrary.
Midoriya, Izuku: Just perfect. His insecurity, anxiety and childhood problems
                  in the face of this equally unequal reality is perfectly well addressed since the first episode of the anime, managing to get chills from the viewer in just 3 episodes. The development of the character is, yes, wonderful, making the experience of re-watching the anime, simply phenomenal, clearly counting on 2 friend to support him in a very decent way, nothing much, but functional. And yes, Midoriya is a crybaby with a reason, if you complain about it, honestly I think you saw the wrong anime.
Bakugou, Katsuki: Honestly, I'm not a fan, only in the current part of the manga I started to think he was good (04/18/2021), but I understand his importance for the plot. Acting perfectly as an impetus for the improvement of Midoriya, Bakugo creates excellent doors for its development.
All Might: The source of everything, with its simply perfect design, the hero manages to make even the viewer feel good about his arrival, thanks to the voice actor's breathtaking work. The structure of the classic American hero is very well placed in this character, of course, as well as the other 2 previously discussed, opening doors to scenes that deepen his psychological.
Note: The uniforms and design of the entire Boku no Hero cast is perfect, but the All Might is something else. All the contrast in his design of classic American hero (clothes with a pattern of the USA flag and classic shading of comics from the same country), with the Japanese heroes, more stylized as anime is beautiful.
As for the villains, I don't have much to say, since my worst criticisms of them come in future seasons (but currently the manga is perfect 10/10). The atmosphere of tension in their presence is well created, for now I can say that.
Finally, Boku no Hero Academia, is an anime that marked me a lot and I recommend it to anyone who wants to start watching anime. Both for its excellent approach to themes, as well as for its pleasant animation and unique universe style, Boku no Hero is undoubtedly one of the best shounens (as a genre, not demographics) ever created.

                When I first heard of My Hero Academia it didn't really seem like an anime I would enjoy. After watching One Punch Man and thoroughly enjoying it I decided to give this one a shot and after watching this first season it quickly became one of if not my favorite anime of all time. Everything about it I loved but where this anime really shines is the characters and the development of them all. The very first episode actually nearly made me cry during a very specific scene.

Another thing is that the characters are easy to relate to because in school everyone has shared the experiences that the characters are going through. I also enjoyed this anime because there is a vast variety of characters and each of them can be argued as
                  the ""best."" If you need to escape reality for a little while, I recommend watching this as it will bring up your mood and make you day a little more bearable. Overall, a great anime.",8,xdiogo630

                Boku no Hero Academia is born in a moment where superhero stories are a marketing hype. Marvel is putting out great movies about superheroes stories, and DC is trying its best. Much like the era where zombies were insanely popular, it's now the superhero era. And it was at the right time that Boku no Hero came out to know exactly how to be popular - appealing to the right type of crowd.
The cartoonish art direction, the reference game and even how the story is told makes Boku no Hero Academia a global title. A storyline that know its limitations and that we all have
                  definitely heard before - an academy made by heroes, and for heroes - doesn't get as old as what really shines isn't the story in itself, but the main cast of characters. The show hits its apex in the relationship between Izuku and All-Might - the two best characters in the series. That's the high point of the whole thing.
Izuku is the protagonist of the show. A well-defined character from the start, Izuku easily steals the attention of the viewer with the marvelous character development he gets - making even the most praised series think how well it was written. In only 4 episodes, the stage is set for greatness as we follow Izuku go from a nobody to a full-stack protagonist with a LOT of potential. These first four episodes of Boku no Hero Academia are a delight to watch. It beautifully introduces the conflict and the story gets SO MUCH done in so little time, I can only praise the screentime management.
Boku no Hero Academia does remarkably well with a storyline we've all heard before - and that's why it's a shounen that works. It appeals to the right type of juvenile crowd, but doesn't make it a ""let me turn my brain off to enjoy this"" experience. It's a rational water drop in an ocean full of mindless shounen shows.
But Boku no Hero Academia doesn't have only four episodes.
The supporting cast of characters left me wanting more. With the exception of Iida, the supporting characters were introduced in a most uninteresting way. None of them got the attention they deserved as all of them were briefly touched episode after episode. After the Katsuki clash, the show seemed to turn into an episodic mix, which is, in my opinion, a poor storytelling device. Each episode had its own conflict built-up to have it resolved in the next episode - only to have its place substituted by another episodic conflict. It would probably be better to take the sweet time to introduce new characters, or to have less side-characters/more flatened-out side-characters.
While the four first episodes were stupidly good, the last episodes were slowed down. This is a common flaw in shounen anime.
I am a strong believer that an anime season must have a start and an end that should hold its own by itself - not needing any other seasons before or after to feel complete. And the ending for the first season of Boku no Hero Academia doesn't hold itself. It creates another scenario and hopes to have you interested until whenever the studio decides it will produce another season. That is quite the turn-down for me and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
On a resumed note, Boku no Hero Academia is a great example of basic storytelling done right. I will write what I believe: If your show has great characters, you don't even need a great storyline. Boku no Hero Academia is a prime example of this - having a pretty simple story that renovates itself through the characters involved.
Art, animation and sound are all stylized to be cartoonish and I love it. It feels good to have consistent animation all throughout the show, as well - it's kind of rare these days. Good work.
All in all, Boku no Hero Academia is a great watch and should be fun for almost anybody. There are no real let-downs and the plot can only go up from here. If you're a western watcher, this show should also be a pretty familiar experience and easy to swallow!",7,hunternoobx

                My Hero Academia - Season 1 (Review):
With an upcoming 5th season later this month, I thought I might as well check out the widely talked about My Hero Academia (also known as Boku no Hero Academia.) While watching this, I decided I was going to completely ignore the toxic as all hell fanbase that notoriously plagues this show like a curse. I figured it would be unfair to judge this show beforehand because of the people that watch it. So I went in with a fresh, unbiased mind to see what I would think. 
And genuinely, I liked it! Before going in, I literally had
                  no idea what this show was about so when I discovered that it was a superhero shonen anime, I was pleasantly surprised. I like superheroes so I was intrigued to see what they would do with the genre. And for the most part, it's really enjoyable honestly. It's not entirely unique, I must admit but the whole premise of a society where 80% of people have superpowers is pretty cool just by itself. The characters are pretty fun, I like All Might, although in the beginning he says he can only hold his form for around 3 hours and that decreases over the course of the show so I have no idea how he manages to hold it for entire lessons never mind entire school days but I digress, maybe I'm overthinking it.
The main character, I'm just gonna use the nickname Deku because I can't remember his real name for the life of me, is actually a really great main lead so far. His struggle of literally being the only quirkless person in his class and being pushed around and ridiculed for it, even by his childhood friend, is a pretty good backstory and a solid compelling character background so to be following him through the show was a delight most of the time. And I say most of the time because while he does go though pretty solid development (and training, like most shonen) it only appears to be in the first half. The second half of this season is superior for its characters and the overall story but the first half I thought was far better in terms of character development for Deku.
I'm really interested in the League of Villains if I'm honest. Their characters and quirks seem pretty awesome and they have a ton of potential to be a genuine threat and also a great general goal for Deku to go up against and conquer. Their part of this season was probably my favourite. The whole little USJ arc was awesome as shit and a great showcase for what's to come. Tomura Shigaraki has a really threatening quirk that I can see being adaptable and playing a big threat for the heroes in the future, but he also seems beatable, like he seems like a great first real villain for Deku to tackle because it seems realistic that he could eventually beat him. He doesn't seem to be the main villain overall though and I'm still interested to find out who the villain was that injured All Might like that, it seems to be a looming presence even over this mostly low stakes season and I'm excited to see what it is. Kurogiri was a cool threat and I'm wondering if he'll play a bigger role or not since his weak points have been exposed and he's not too difficult to take down anymore. Nomu was  a curious part of the show, I'm not entirely sure it was a real person since it took every command Tomura gave it and when it was separated from him, it didn't resist arrest at all, almost as if it was on autopilot and wasn't fighting back because it had no commands to. It seems to be a creation rather than a person, like a Frankenstein's monster type deal so I'm interested to see if there'll be more of them to come. 
The main plot isn't really complicated or anything, it's relatively basic and simple. It's not bad but it's not outstanding. The show has potential for some incredible arcs to come so I'm hoping it delivers on it. The only part of the plot I didn't like was that no one died. It seemed like they were going for higher stakes at the end when Nomu was smashing Aizawa's head into the floor, I was like finally the show is getting dark. I was loving that it didn't seem afraid to be darker with its content (the violence was great by the way) and I was intrigued to see a Shonen with higher stakes, a darker plot and violence. But the Aizawa survived all that stuff when it definitely looked like he was dead and I don't know, I kind of thought it was a cop out. If the show took risks and actually killed him off or you know, maybe actually injure at least one of the students other than Deku, I feel it might've left more of an impact. But the fact that everyone walked out of USJ alive and no students were actually harmed when the villains that attacked are supposed to be the main threat, I think it kind of cheapens their credibility. They better do some good stuff with Aizawa's character since they cheesed it and let him survive, otherwise that was a waste of a potentially impactful moment and a missed chance to establish My Hero Academia as something different, a show willing to take risks, but I guess not. Anyway, I still have 3 seasons to come and a 5th one yet to release so maybe it'll get miles better, who knows.
Overall, My Hero Academia is probably my least favourite out of the Shonen I've seen so far (granted, I've not seen too many) but it definitely shows potential to get much better and as of right now, I'm in season 2 and the tournament arc seems like it's going to be fun and it appears to be improving so I'm glad about that. But by itself, season 1 is good, but rather basic and misses chances to establish itself as something new and different and instead plays it safe. But I will admit, I love the Japanese take on superheroes and I think my enjoyment is what mostly makes me want to be generous with this show, I like longer anime too and My Hero Academia feels somewhat comforting to me right now. It's rather basic but has the possibility of getting so much better and on an entertainment level, I thought it was genuinely great. I'm looking forward to the later seasons to see how it does.

                Story: Lots of crying (on par with Deadman Wonderland, so much the creators made somewhat of a meme out of it in season 2), lots of weak and unoriginal story lines, and generally unlikable or cliche characters. The powers are what make them interesting, not their struggles / personalities.Oh, and WAY too many flashbacks.
Art: It's somewhat of a hit-or-miss, but I honestly think it's great. I was amazed by some parts!
Sound: I'm not really a fan of ops / endings, and the same applied here. Skipped both every time to protect from opening spoilers, and watched them afterwards. I didn't miss much. General sound and
                  music are good though.
Character: As described above, poor. We just get a bunch of random characters thrown in our face all at the same time, and don't really have any time to explore them. Since the seasons are so short, at the end of season 2 I still know only 5 names, mostly because the characters have poorly developed / -explored backstories. 
Enjoyment: However, mostly because it's watching people with dope powers fight a lot, the anime is enjoying to watch. 
Overall: I think it's a great anime for people who don't have the time to watch Naruto, although I think they've got the same amount of filler in percentages.",6,BluezamX

                Well goddamn, I have to give credit where credit is due, this really is a great shonen battle anime. This is a genre that may seem easy to write, but My Hero Academia does a great job of maintaining a balance between all the elements of effective characterization in this genre, escalation of powers, not one but two strong central dynamics between the growing up and education of Midoriya with All Might and Bakugo, general worldbuilding, and actually good humor throughout. I haven't seen the completion of one of the big shonen anime, and what I have seen has been limited, mainly old Naruto and
                  the first season of Attack on Titan. People might say that what makes certain anime of this genre good is more, ""you know it when you see it"" rather than an exact critique of how they work. I think what makes them captivating and popular to so many people is a great balance between the personal, smaller story of the main character, and the much larger adventure and world that can be explored for episodes upon episodes.
This first season is basically one big introduction to Midoriya and what he will accomplish as a great hero. The ending doesn't exactly segue nicely into what will really become of him in the future, or what that plot might hold, and the general narrative of this is a bit too quick in some ways. And that all comes down to trying to fit a lot in 13 episodes. The creators do an admirable job though.
There are positives and negatives here, but I think the show really clicks well with All Might. From the intro (and what absolutely great music is in the opening and ending credits) I thought everything would be way too earnest with him as it is with Midoriya, but he is so interesting as a genuinely strong hero, playing a front for his weakness and trying to exist as a hero in public as long as possible, a great honest sense of humor about his problems, and genuine charisma to all the other characters. Both of his designs are hilarious in their exaggeration, I love the blood spurting from his mouth as a quick sign of surprise or shock (and that sentence not sounding psychotic is what I love about animation). This show is honestly funny and has great character and power design as reflections of their personalities.
So in summary, I don't think the show is perfect, and I think there is some wavering in its quality in the next season from how it's set up here, but I feel a much stronger impact and connection to this first season than how everyone talks about Mob Psycho 100 or One Punch Man.",8,thestarsailor

                The story is quite interesting and at the start you really understand what the protagonist is feeling. The first few episodes are mostly just to tell you what is happening before the story really starts. I like how the show tells you both sides to the story and shows you why things happen the way they do. They give a good backstory to the villains. You don't get told much about each person in the class but you see how they all interact and what kind of person they are. The story sometimes has long fight scenes and has some funny scenes as well.

                One word: Cliche (therefore predictable)
Heroes named heroes and villains named villains. SERIOUSLY?
Protagonist was born without superpowers and wants to be the strongest in a world where everyone has a superpower. That already is a very bland theme. 
Will the protagonist ever meet and impress the now- greatest hero? Of course he fucking does. Does the protagonists' idol sees ""something"" in him. Of course. Will the protagonists' idol entrust him with his legacy? Yes. The story (and sometimes the dialogues too) are fucking predictable. 
The characters are straight up boring. Midoriya is the authors' attempt of creating another Uzumaki Naruto: an underdog who wants to make
                  it to the top. 
I HATE BAKUGO. His only personality is his anger over enerything. Did Midoriya go to a library? --HOW DARE MIDORIYA GO TO A LIBRARY! IS HE TRYING TO LOOK SMARTER THAN ME !! FUCK YOUUUU!!!--  Is there a new kid in the town? HOW DARE HE THINK HE IS STRONGER THAN MEEE! 
All Might is trying too hard to be inspirational, therefore is very immature. Of course everybody thinks All Might is the coolest person in the world for some reason. 
My Hero Academia is not a show to be wasting time on. Overrated doesn't begin to describe how unworthy it is of its popularity. Sound and the animation are the only good things in the whole season.

                MHA is one of the most talked about anime of recent memory. Is at least this season worthy of the hype that the later seasons generate? Frankly, I'd hope to believe it will get even better, admittedly I'd not watched beyond the first season. But as a starter, I think it is very good and does indeed live up to the hype. 
The main aspect that is worthy of note is how  seriously it takes its themes, it's character's struggles, and the imminent danger they face in situations. Sometimes, I feel like conflict in anime is just thrown in there, because they need something
                  to keep it interesting. But the danger is so poorly acted: the characters don't see it as much of a threat, it's not really a threat, and the viewer is like hooo-hummmm as well. 
But in MHA, there is always a real feeling of tension. It's always coming from the eyes of our main character, Midoriya, who takes situations very seriously. And as such, the viewer sees it the same way. The plot is honestly slow, but it's what you call ""slow and steady."" It's the story of someone gaining both the physical and mental strength to be a hero, and if he were to gain that all too fast, what would be the point of seeing his growth? But his growth is well documented over a long series of meaningful tests that he overcomes, and seeing even the smallest amounts of his growth is worthy of the viewer's elation. 
Next up, characters. I know they get even better in the future, but I already cannot stop loving many side and supporting characters. Their designs are funky, and at first, I was really put off by the designs. But some of the ""quirkiness"" of their designs lead to really unique characters. Take Tsuyu, for example. She could not be achieved without the overly cartoony art style of the anime, and thus the style often works. Of the characters, my favorites are Uraraka and Tsuyu, though there hasn't been much time to develop anyone but Midoriya so far, and to some extent, Bakugou. 
A slow and steady start for what seems to be a great anime that does live up to the hype. I give it 8.0/10.",8,41gguy

                I'll try to be as short as possible so I don't write stuff u already heard from everyone else without spoiling any of the plot development.
This anime came out around the same time as One punch man and it has a pretty similar plot. A world where being a hero is actually a job, and heroes have their own association. Ofcourse One punch man had a huge succes and this anime is somewhat less popular living in it's shadow.  But don't get fooled by this, it's an amazin anime. Comparing it to his more succesful brother I would say it's less gorry and more
                  targeted towards younger viewes. 
What's great: a diverse set of characters, a very likeable protagonist and, most important, it's that kind of anime that will get your heart beating and actually thrive of the character's emotions. My personal favorite thing about this anime it's that it managed to make a maincharacter that doesn't follow the same typical goofy funny looking kid of all mainstream anime like Naruto, One Piece, DB, etc. This kid is actually really smart altough he's wimpy at times.
Favorite character: Deku (a very DETERMINED kid who will stop at nothing to become a hero)
SCORE
1. why not higher? This show kinda lacks, at least for now, some great villains. I understand that it's only the 1st season and it's more interested in showing us the plot and the main characters.
2. why not lower? Because it has something that not many other anime have. The power to make a guy like me and maybe some of u who are reading this show us what u can do when u are 100% determined to succed.

                I have just started watching this anime series due to its availability on Hulu.  I heard good things from my co-workers and even before then, I thought the story of a superhero school had high potential for enjoyment.
After watching the first 7 episodes, I found that I was probably not the target demographic for this anime aimed for maybe young teenager age (tweens).
I just think that the characters are pretty bland archetypes of the school type variety.  Probably as bland as the Marvel superheroes in the Marvel movies.  I don't have time for such characters that are so cookie-cutter.
If you enjoy Marvel
                  movies, then I'd give this one a chance.  If I had a kid, then yeah, I'd definitely watch this with them.
So my review is this:  If you like Marvel movies, then Yes, give this a chance.  If you have a kid, then Yes, definitely watch the shit out of this with him/her.  Or if you're like me, then just watch if you need something to watch while you're cooking/eating or want something on in the background.",6,kintarofan

                This show had all the potential to be EXCELLENT, but it just wasn't.
Midoriya, the main character, was born without the ability to use magic - meaning he couldn't become a hero. I really love this trope and was excited to dive into another show with this type of concept. However, my favorite parts in these stories are when the MC overcomes those obstacles and ""levels up"" or grows stronger somehow. And while Midoriay does become stronger, it's not to the extent or fast pace as I wanted. For me, his progression took so long, and even by the last episode of season five, he's still
                  not using 100% of his power, and there's really no explanation why. 
All Might (who gave his power to Midoriay) was also born quirkless (without magic), and when he inherited his power, he was able to use it as soon as possible. So why can't Midoriya?
I will say that I do like a lot of the characters in this show, except for the villains. Maybe it's me, but their villainry doesn't seem justified enough. Others may not care, but I like to understand why someone is acting the way they are. And it felt that way throughout all the villains depicted - I didn't sense a true rage behind their fight. 
The biggest thing that let me down though, was the plot. It was lacking in so many ways. As I said, this really could have been top tier. Yet, five seasons in, and there wasn't some HUGE plot twist, or a ""WOW"" climax, or anything that made me feel like I HAD to watch this show. Disappointing. 
If you like these underdog types of stories, it's worth watching for that factor. I just wouldn't go in expecting it to be as good as some other shows, however.",8,hbaby1093

As the beginning of the series it has a special place in my heart, however is it very short and not as action packed as other seasons.The most action part is the ending which was very entertaining and arguably the best part of the season. Then of course there is Deku earning his quirk
                  which is a very memorable moment. Aswell as the very memorable scene that made All Might choose Deku, Deku jumps out and tries to fight a villian that is way stronger than him just to save bakugo.

I think this 13 episode series is the sweet spot for me. Doesn't take enough time and takes not much of investment. I'd be mad if this was a 26 episode season; anything beyond 20 episode requires commitment and if there is not enough meat to the story it is just a waste of time. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the characters and animation. It has a comic feel to it. Although the broad

                Yes, BNHA is a very good show but there are a few  things that I don't recommend about it.  For beginners, I do not recommend this anime. There are a lot of episodes throughout the series and if you're the type of person that watches series to the end it will probably take a long time. But besides that its a good show. Sometimes during some episodes it gets a bit boring but besides that it's a pretty good show.
-spoilers ahead- 
This is the main story if you wanna learn about it, the show starts off by introducing ""quirks"" which are the powers
                  most people have. But Izuku Midoriya(aka Deku), the main protagonist, that loves hero's(and wants to be one) doesn't have a quirk. This green haired child finds out after going to his local doctor and is devastated. But he doesn't give up. His dream is to go to UA , a school that trains people that want to be a hero. But he know he doesn't have a quirk. If we skip ahead, we see that Izuku meets All Might (the #1 hero) and ask him questions and then he goes on about how he wants to be a hero. If we skip ahead again, you find out that Izuku does get a quirk. How? You find out that All Might's quirk(One for All) is transferred trough DNA, so you know Izuku is desperate. So he eats one of All Might's Hairs.
Thats all I'm gonna put because this is getting long and I'm tired.
So now to the art, 10/10. The character designs and setting get better and better throughout the story. There face expressions really describe there feelings and how the settings looks is outstanding.
I'm gonna skip over to Character.
The characters feelings do match with there outfits, which make the story way better. There expressions match with everyone around them and it's fun to watch because of this when your bored.
Enjoyment, the show is very good! With the designs, story, and everything else, it's a good show to watch on a Wednesday afternoon.

Boku no hero is a fun anime to watch, the story could be better, like, have a better character development or just, stop forgetting about the characters, but its fun.
Izuku Midoriya as a character is development, you can see that he has more than one trait, but I cant say the same for the

The girls doesn't add much for the story beacuse the author doesn't know how to do girls, so they feel so shallow. They don't have much personality, they're there just because it needs girl. 
It could be better.
Art 8/10
The art of this anime is so pretty and stylized and so great. It's the perfection betweet American comic style and anime style.

*SPOILER-FREE*
         If there was a show that could be considered one of the Modern Shounen Greats, that show is “My Hero Academia”. As probably the biggest mainstream hit, other than “Demon Slayer”, it is a manga adaptation with studio Bones in charge of the animation.
	Animation wise, “My Hero Academia” really hit it out of the park, the fights were absolutely amazing, the powers and their interaction with each other and the surroundings was really creative and enjoyable to watch, and the climax moments were as good as one can ask for (also
                  due to the amazing music and soundtracks that really took the fights to the next level). The wide variety of characters and powers with the vivid and bright colours really made it stood out. The world was well designed as were the backgrounds and places throughout the seasons.
	However, despite the amazing characters and animation, “My Hero Academia” ends up falling in a lot of tropes and stereotypes that make it lose that sense of uniqueness that other shows might have. The plot is good, especially the anti-hero ‘Stain’ arc but in many other moments and plot points it was pretty much a power of friendship, good defeats evil kind of narrative, which I’m not saying it is bad, since it appeals to a very big audience, but not my type of tea.
	Overall, “My Hero Academia” is an amazing show and what a true Shounen is at his best, it does not have the best written story or characters, but it makes up for that in awesome action scenes and fights.",6,ICenturyI

                My Hero Academia
Next to magic, there is nothing greater than ""superpowers"" every child has ever dreamed of having or imitating real superheroes. Precisely because of the creation of various superhero comics like Marvel and DC, they are practically the embodiment of children's desires. 
Later, it was decided to get more out of superhero comics by trying to reach adults with them as well. With controversial topics, philosophical discussions about direction and wrong. About politics, the social system, and even the limitations of a hero in the free execution of his actions.
My Hero Academia"" also takes a cue from this. Although the first season begins relatively
                  colorful and looks like a typical colorful shounen, the manga/anime later develops into a relatively dark story of murder, betrayal, manipulation, and genocide. 
An exceedingly popular criticism of this Show, we have the melodrama, which I honestly can't support. Many of the characters are children who were blessed with a relatively normal childhood, and some had somewhat disheartening childhoods. And these try to become heroes and expose themselves to a lot of stress. I myself have seen one or two students dejected and even crying because they failed a test. These are normal human emotions. Not every child is our role model ""JoJo's protagonist"", who at the age of 17, looks like Rambo fights with some 200-year-old vampires in Egypt and uses broken ribs as toothpicks. 
What was an even bigger problem for me personally are the ""last-second rescues"" in this anime. Here it still kind of worked, but later you will see that the author wanted to defuse EVERY situation in the last second. In the long run, it gets really annoying. 
But here it is first in the prologue of the series, the first season. And what did it have to offer? 
[Story 4]
First and foremost, yes, the story probably takes the most completely typical and clichéd approach to a superhero comic. I'm not sure if this was intended as a ""gag"" or simply a superhero comic parody. But at least here we are. The protagonist is our super ""underdog"" who has nothing at all except his will. He meets the hero of heroes quite ""by chance"" and convinces him through his self-sacrificing actions to bequeath his power to him. 
The sequence of events in this season is only explained by various training exercises and probably the best part of the ""school days"" in MHA. Since it becomes much less interesting in the later seasons. Here the skills are tested and analyzed for strengths and weaknesses. Along the way, the concept of abilities in the world is presented to the viewer and the first bonds between characters are woven. Some on an emotional level, others just through humorous moments. 
At the end of the season, a little serious atmosphere is created by seeing the aggressive and radical actions of the ""bad guys"". However, this is still within Friendly Family bounds compared to later seasons.
[Music 8] 
The intro is not a new world wonder, though it does have a certain catchiness. The Osts, on the other hand, are very fitting and were able to underscore most of the moments very well. In contrast to seasons 3 and 4, the use of the osts becomes very spongy. Here you can still feel the quality behind the production.
We have the ""You Say Run"" Theme, what can be done wrong with this? 
[Animations 8]
What did you expect? Of course, this series is well animated, at least in the first season. The colorful presentation, transitions to a more somber contrast. As well as the choreography of the fights and presentation of the powers. Not to mention the last fight in the season, which has been both dynamic and very motivating. 
[Characters 5]
My Hero Academia has a great variety of characters with different personalities. This lends itself perfectly to creating a bizarre and exhilarating rapport and captivating the viewer. The characters are by no means deep, but make up for it with their personalities and charisma. 
Their design is also creatively done.  At first glance, you couldn't really tell who the protagonist is if you had never heard of the anime. 
Even as the manga progresses, you won't see much more of the characters than minor motivational traits and some moments of brilliance they''ll receive. Midoriya, Bakugo, and Todoroki are the only 3 that actually have more. Unfortunately, nothing that I would call above average. At the end of the day, they have relatively simple approaches. Todoroki with the family drama, Bakugo defining the envy and hate, and Midoriya the underdog trying to win everyone over. 
It's an approach, but not enough. 
[Conclusion 5]
My Hero Academia is, in MY opinion, an anime that I could rewatch 10 times without getting bored. It has almost everything I want. Substance, likable characters, emotions, music, and a strong representation of the will of the characters. Likewise, I've always been a fan of superpowers and supernaturals. And for someone like me, My Hero Academia is an absolute MUST. 
Unfortunately, you can't ignore the wasted potential. Even though the manga gets much better, later on, the beginning was very bumpy and squandered an immense amount of potential.

                Here's how it is this is very similar to OPM. If you don't think so you're lying to yourself but that's not a bad thing. They are both exceptional animes in their own rights and deserve to both be respected and liked despite their similarities which aren't that major.
Pros: Great character relationships, class rivalries, various powers.
Cons: Shounen troped comic relief that spoils the awesome.
~SPOILERS~
OPM = one punch(or huge combos) with no ill side-effects, MHA = multiple punches(or limited use of abilities) with devastating side-effects. OPM heroes get paid, MHA aren't paid but they're sponsored. Super Skills(OPM) vs Super Powers(MHA). OPM = MHA huge damage to
                  residential areas, Heroes vs Villains, hero ranking system.
Now onto the actual review ~may contain spoilers~ MHA is a very good anime it is paced slower than the manga but there are reasons for this to split it into arcs which are easier to maintain and we don't run into the ""One Piece"" syndrome of the manga/anime reaching the same point.
Deku(Izuku MIDORIYA) who is always beat down by Anger(Katsuki BAKUGOU) who is also quirkless finally gets a power transferred to him by the #1 hero in this world. This may seem unfair or OP but his every use of the power results in him destroying his body crippling himself till he gets healed. This arc is to introduce the heros the powers expose us to some villains, but mainly to show us this world and establish it. That's it really. It's entertaining and enjoyable but is better appreciated by those who have read the manga first, but it can be enjoyed by those who haven't",8,PharuanUndearth

                After a massive time of not logging into MAL for absolutely no reason, but still holding out an opinion on each piece of media that I consumed in between, I'm going to go back and retroactively grade and review everything I've been watching since September(?). Having only a minor recollection of the order, I'm going to spill what I remember out and then, if there is something I've forgotten weeell I'll come back to that as well.

OK unfortunately this means that each show that I watched with a different season will call
                  for my opinions on said season, and this is particularly awkward with MHA; does the fact that this season is mostly set up for what comes afterwards excuse that I enjoyed it much less, because less of a focus on all the (great) characters that we in full force later on to make way for the relationship between Midoriya and All-Might (and also with Bakugo)? Well, yes, but actually no. At the time, it was a seven and I am leaving that here BUT rest assured, what follows - from letting us know the characters in class 1A better to expanding the worldbuilding and giving us better villians - season 2 definitely takes the elements we are given here and works with them.",7,mattkerr494

                First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.

✦Story
Straightforward battle shounen, a bit more of ""tagged"" hero anime although. Meanings it's somewhat similar as ""T&B"" where hero system is made into official government approved system. Anyhow, we get hero schools, people born with ""quirks"" and thus the plot progresses by oddity who slowly grows towards a dream. Can't really say much else without spoiling. I found story okay I guess, though I'm not really fond such set-up or style.
✦Art
Art is very ""childish"", probably that's how I would describe it. Moronic hero outfits and very upbeat
                  and child-for art/animation style. It was okay, but simply not my cup of tea.
✦Sound
Not special, not bad. Simple and enjoyable. That's all how I can describe it.
✦Character
So we get utter wimp guy as MC, who we will slowly observe as he grows. Bunch of annoying stereo-types side-characters. Extremely aggressive muscle-head, a utter rich-boy-know-it-all-model-student guy, sticky bubblegum girl and so on.
Probably liked the most frog-girl. Aside that characters are watch-able for me, but not that fond of most of them.
✦Enjoyment/overall
""Modern'ized"" battle shounen, where are plenty of elements that I dislike, but battles are cool and that's a most important factor of such Anime type. So In the end it's good anime, but nothing amazing.",7,DesolatePsyche

                A shounen anime with an approach I had never seen before. In my opinion, they took character development to another level.
The story is very interesting, the context in which the characters are inserted is complex and I identified so much with the protagonists in many different aspects.
I love how this anime works with cliches: there are characters that do represent the classic cliches, however, they're way more complex that that, only their shell seem like the cliche, but they're complex and intense and way more than what they seem to be.
The art, including the animation, the battles, the character design is very good, beautiful, dynamic
                  and expressive, the colors are very well used. The voice acting, the sounds effects and the songs (openings, endings) are good, but I didn't find them outstanding, they're enough, they work well with the scenes. Something interesting about this anime is that it works many characters at the same time, and in my opinion, it manages to make fans feel empathy for them. The characters aren't superficial, each one has their own problems, their own advantages and they all grow through the story, they grow in power and in personality, becoming more mature, finding out more about themselves. Of course some supporting characters' development is not as well explored as the most central characters, but as a season 1, it introduced them in a very efficient way. 
The pace is very good, not too slow, not too fast, I found the anime very inspiring and very different from usual shonen animes, the protagonist isn't the usual extroverted, even reckless protagonist, actually, quite the opposite in many aspects, and that made things really interesting in my opinion.
It was really fun and inspiring watching it.",8,Sigmazyal

                I remember when i saw the news back in like 2015 or some shit that there was a new anime based on some manga i never heard of or spoken about, now my real review for Boku no Pico Academia is just as blunt and too the point, Do I like Boku no hero Academia (Green hair non-ninja Naruto, Blonde Explosion genderbent teenage Megumin from Konosuba, and Brown haired Love interest who can make the stratosphere disappear or Boku no Hero Macadamia however the fuck you call it)? FUCK YEAH. I think it's amazing!

                Anime extremely enjoyable to watch. It's colorful, alive, cheerful, up. It's delicious.
The story is friendly and attracts the audience. It's realistic. We would all like to be heroes, would not we? Some, even villains, if it were possible!
The way the plot is approached until it has falls of yield, mainly by the exacerbated weeping of the protagonist. He really is very chatíssimo at certain times.
The animation itself once referred to comic books. The directors, and author, probably pulled on this side of heroism.
Also to mention the fact that the anime always leave us curious to know what peculiarity will have a certain character. In this
                  first season, the anime goes from OK to GOOD. With great potential at hand. Let's see the unfolding, and the second season, of course!",7,Hygor_DDL

                This is just a very good shounen anime.  Alright, it has little more to offer than the classic shounen tropes, but if that’s what you like, you’ll find this one entertaining.  There’s classic superhero world building and power structure, larger than life heroes and villains, and naïve young people setting out into a world of violence.  The show has good pacing, interesting and likeable characters, and fun action scenes that correspond well with the characters unique abilities.
One theme that I think My Hero Academia tackles very well, is the idea of greatness.  The characters have familiar traits you would find in
                  elite athletes or really any other elite level performer.  Midoriya especially reminds of interviews I’ve seen with the very best athletes.  There’s no tragic backstory, and no strong external motivation for pushing forward; there’s simply this obsessive internal drive that forces one to constantly push limits.  He’s not especially charismatic, but I think that’s part of what makes him actually quite relatable as someone destined to become “the number 1 hero.” 
The friendly rivalries as classmates who are competing for opportunities while simultaneously becoming friends to help one another are fantastic.  There’s clashes of ego and reconciling weaknesses.  The students grow in meaningful and interesting ways throughout the series.  Watching as an adult, I like the idea that all the characters are still shown as kids.  They’re the elite so they can compete with many adults, but they can still be quite naïve, and it’s not on them to save the world yet.",9,mtl5059

                I was recommended to watch this so-called titular superhero-themed show after hearing non-stop about it for several years. It's clear upon watching the first season why so many anime lovers are intrigued and fascinated with it. The story is rather clichè; a kid without superpowers dreams to be a hero and... then gets those powers, of course gifted to him by none other than his childhood idol, All-Might. Now, these superhero-like abilities are called Quirks in this universe but it's still safe to say, the plot at the beginning was rather expected. As the episodes plow on, it is somewhat riveting to watch Midoriya Izuku
                  gain his 'Quirk' and enter the school of his dreams. Yes, yes this is all to be expected but then again it's anime. In terms of art, I rather enjoyed the style in which this series is drawn in. The presentation of All-Might is humourous; the man mirrors patriotism and relishes in an American-like demeanour. All of the characters have somewhat distinctive features about them, thus seperating this anime from those that draw teenagers with the same body shape and simply change the eye and hair colours. In terms of sound, the voice actors (Japanese as I watch the sub) are fitting. All-Might is loud, boisterous yet compelling while Aizawa Shota is presented as the tired, weary teacher with his bored voice. Now, let's talk about characters and most importantly their arcs. Our protagonist is Midoriya Izuku whom at first the audience is driven to feel sympathy for the Quirkless boy. His perservence and determination, coupled with his hilarious muttering and quick-thinking make this teenager a good central character for the story to revolve around. Personally, I found it rather unpleasant at first when Midoriya recieved All-Might's Quirk, I was more engulfed in the idea that the anime would centre around a character who really was Quirkless. However, soon it becomes clear that Midoriya, despite earning a place at his dream school and finally getting a Quirk, wouldn't be living an easy life. What I love about this anime is that it doesn't really focus too much on Midoriya, and often branches out on his classmates and their character arcs. The roles are rather clichè to begin with but each of these characters are soon given the spotlight and not simply pushed to the side like NPCs in a video game. Bakugo 'Kacchan' Katsuki is presented as Midoriya's 'rival' however instead of pitting these two boys against each other in a love-fuelled and hormonal driven arc (as to be expected of some animes *cough *cough), we can actually sympathise with some characters. While Midoriya does view Bakugo as somewhat of a rival, it's clear that these two childhood friends have very different views of each other, making Midoriya the 'better' character out of them. Midoriya strives to be better and his relationship with his 'crush' Ochaco Uraraka is comical and sweet to say the least. It's not some sappy and lazily put together storyline that is stolen by the numerous shows revolving around powers, the main characters are actually presented as teenagers. The main setting being the school is perfect for some aspects of realism in the anime and hence I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. Admittedly, no anime is without it's flaws. The storyline, while interesting and light-headed, is slow at times. Although all the characters are unqiue, I felt that the story was lacking something, something that I think will become obvious in the seasons to come. Overall, I'm giving this anime a 7 which is understandably harsh given my compliments however, I hope that this show gives a voice to many in the future and continues to thrive. It is more often than not that some animes deteriorate in detail after a few seasons due to sloppy plots and poor writing skills. Please don't fail to surprise me, MHA! I'm currently on season 4 and I'll admit there are quite a few filler epsiodes but I assume that is to be expected with an anime full of interesting and detailed characters. Thank you!",7,parhkers

                BNHA follows all the cliches and stereotypes of any other shonen while borrowing story elements from popular western media (read: star wars), but manages to make those tropes its own with a unique execution. 
Story:
Starts off slow, there is a protagonist who has no powers, an outcast who dreams of becoming the greatest of all, and things happen and he gets a power. The trope is made tolerable because of its execution - Izuku has to train to prepare himself to receive it, and there are plenty of drawbacks to how he can use it as well. The exam and training arcs establish some side
                  characters and relationships, but doesn't do anything too special. The final fight with Nomu vs All Might is the best moment of the season that manages to showcase the diminished, yet impressive power of All Might in a high stakes battle that does a good job of introducing the villains to the main characters, and the fight itself is well animated and more importantly, well paced, having more fight than talk - always a good thing.
Art and Animation
The show's strength definitely lies here, and the action is enjoyable because of the smooth movement and the impressive sakuga moments that consistently impress, peaking of course, with the final smash blasting Nomu off. 
Worldbuilding
Earth in the near future, with a society that ascribes most prestige to the profession of a hero. The world does seem to revolve around heroes a little too much to be believable, but mostly there are interesting questions that are raised in the first season that do get attention in later arcs, like the consequences of institutionalizing heroism, and the divide between the gifted and the quirkless. 
Characters
Few main characters are very memorable, like All Might, Izuku, Bakugo, Fire Lord Endeavour and Todoroki Zuko. Others are distinct, but not fleshed out, but there's only so much you can do in 13 episodes, I'll reserve that judgemnt for later seasons.
Overall, BNHA has a not very unique premise that is well executed, and got big at the right time to fill the shonen void left by Naruto. It delivers the action with the fairly interesting world, but it remains to be seen what it will do with those deeper sociological themes that are raised by its premise",6,Firecold2000

                Wow! What a great first season 'Boku no Hero Academia' was!
At the beginning of the show it seemed to be a bit of a cheesy concept, especially with all the stuff around All-Might. Holy god was I wrong. I thought the way they used this idea of superpowers was perfect. They somehow made the idea of superpowers unique, which blew my mind away.
This show had such good vibes surrounding it when I watched it. It just managed to put a smile on my face every time the new episode came out! I also thought the show had some top level comedy, which I certainly didn't
                  expect from it, but was definitely happily surprised.
I thought the OST was downright perfect. Some of the best soundtrack I've heard from any show ever to be completely honest. Made many scenes much better with the placements of the music.
And lastly, I thought the story was fantastic. It really makes you warm up to Deku because he had to go through so much just be considered the 'norm' in the world he was living. To spare others on spoilers, Deku had to go through crazy scenarios just to get to where he was, I and thought that was freaking awesome.
My only minor complaint about the show was that the villains were at a pretty big disadvantage as the heroes, but I believe that it was just there in the first season to set the scene on how powerful the heroes were. In the 2nd season I believe things will change drastically.
If this review does not seem professional, it's because it's not! It is only my 2nd one ever, so take it lightly! :D",9,mishh
31964,"
                Wow. Out of all the anime I've watched, none have been as good as this one. It is even better than I ever thought it could be. I contemplated watching this show for YEARS now, only JUST getting into it, and I am so happy I did. The story is great, the characters are entertaining, I love the artstyle, what's more to say?
It's only been thirteen episodes so far and some of the characters are already fleshed out so much and even the ones that aren't as fleshed out are super fun to witness. Another thing I really like about is that each superpower is
                  super unique. It could've been SO EASY to just make the superpowers generic like ""flight,"" ""super strength,"" ""laser eyes"" and stuff but the show takes it to an extra level and gives everyone a super unique power, such as making explosions, freezing with one hand and burning in the other, and having all the powers of a frog. Even better, each power has it's own really unique weakness that can be exploited, so not only are the powers super unique, but the weaknesses are too. For example, one character has electricity, but if he uses it more than he can normally take, he becomes braindead for about an hour. This was something I liked with Fire Force, and it's nice to see that with all of superpowers, not just pyrokinesis. 
Each of the 13 episode of this season has been a solid hit, and that is something I haven't seen in any other anime I've watched. Even my favorite anime like Ass Class and Darling in the Franxx have their weaker episodes, but this season has been having hit after hit each episode. 
I guess the ONLY, and I mean ONLY flaw I have with this season is mineta's entire existence, and EVEN THEN, he is MEANT to be hated, so it's not really a fault on the writers. 
This show is a MUST WATCH. And the craziest thing about this anime is that I heard that this season is the weakest from the bunch, so it only gets better from here.",10,NintendoBoy1889
31964,"
                I have always been back and forth with this series. On one hand, it's art is outstanding, the voice acting is top tier, and it takes the shounen cliches and makes them good. But on the other hand, it's characters are cliche as well and the building is very slow, especially for this season. Before the die-hard fans jump up my butt, I am not calling this series bad but what I am saying is that the first season does not do the series justice.
Story 6/10:
The story is nothing special about this anime. It follows the same formula as other shounen anime with its storytelling,
                  however, what we see in this season is that it's just too slow. One could say that the slowness is used for better storytelling and better character development even but the fact is that it takes half the episodes to actually get to anything meaningful, with the first episodes just playing on how the main character is a cry-baby loser and is bullied for not having a superpower. Then after those episodes, the show does pick up for those of you who can make it through the hour and a half long training montage that takes up the first half.
For the first season, there is not much about the story that I can say as there is not much story, to begin with. If anything the first season is an introduction season to the series so I would advise you to treat it as such.
Art 10/10:
If there is any best part about Boku no Hero Academia, it is most definitely the art. While at a glance the characters and art may not seem like much but I believe where this anime most shines is in its action sequences. Out of all the action anime I have watched, this show has one of the best. Even being a superpower anime, they do not just use the common orbs of different colors smashing into each other. The action scenes and animations are so fluid and well done that it's incredible. If anything at all I would recommend watching simply for the animations and after this season, it only gets better.
Another good aspect of the art is the diverse ranges of design of the characters, main or otherwise. As you will see there are some characters who, due to their quirk, have inhuman features, the design, and style of these characters are great, and the animations with them are smooth. I honestly cannot find anything to complain about the animations and art of Boku no Hero Academia.
Characters 8/10:
So what you will see with the characters is that they all start off as the cliche shounen characters; crybaby, loud and mean, justice, pervert, cheeky, airhead, name a character cliche and it probably has it. Before that writes you off though, the character development in here is what keeps it away from being something you should drop. Though I did say that the beginning is rather slow, there is development, and it is clearly shown. Each of the characters goes through their own development, the biggest two in this season being Midoriya and Bakugo, so if you don't like them, do not worry for they get better.
The characters may bug you or put you off in the beginning, they did for me but once I got passed that, after the first 5-6 episodes, they became more likable and closer to the end became my favorites. The biggest thing about this show is just how the pacing is, it's slow and this season works more or less as a build-up.
Overall 8/10:
The anime is good, it's not as good as people hype it to be but I did thoroughly enjoy it, even more so during the later seasons. I would recommend is use this as an introduction season and either let it run in the background or watch as a simple build-up to the later seasons. If you do not mind the slow beginning pace or a season used for character introductions and development, then do by all means watch this, you will not regret it.",8,krazykombat

                Honestly this is one of my favorite animes I have ever watched(Top 5 favorite). I really loved the character development and I really love how the main character was quirkless and weak, and became the strongest in his class and hopefully in the future the new Symbol of Peace. My favorite part about the anime is the concept of their universe, ""Quirks"". I love how some can have amazing quirks like Explosion and Gravity Control, and some could have normal Quirks like Telekinesis. Also I love that not all people are with a quirk, 20% of the population aren't. I really suggest this as a
                  first anime to watch and start on watching anime. Amazing.",10,Zed124

                I really like anime which has mystery element. I won’t lie, thinking about the real deal or surprised by the plot twist is one of my favorites. But I also like anime which has really not that original plot or development but makes me watch anyway or feel hyped about that show or get excited even though I know exactly how it will end up. This is that kind of anime. 
Actually, I started this anime with some prejudice. Well, the plot wasn’t so unfamiliar. ""Zero to Hero"" kind of story. And the way it developed wasn’t really surprising. It was obvious how it will
                  end the moment it started. So you may say “So, it was a boring shounen anime.” Well, no. That’s the weird point. Even though you know pretty much everything, you still feel attached to the story like you are one of them and excited like you don’t know how it will end. I didn’t realize that story wasn’t that good until I started to think about the anime.  Watching the characters grow through each episode and watching them fight with each other… It locked you to the screen, even though it’s three a.m. in the morning your heart says “continue” and your hands obey as your heart pleases. When it ended, I realized I binged watched this anime even though I have a lot of to do.  
It ended as it says:“It was only a prologue to the second anime. Watch the second anime for more.” So I’m not going to throw a lot of questions that didn’t have answers. But I kind of wish that they put a little bit more clues. I hope that they will be answered or at least given some kind of explanation.  But I want to talk about characters. 
The thing that I loved was the fact that every character has a weakness along their power. I don’t want to give spoilers so I won’t give examples but if you have watched the anime you will understand.  More power they have, more apparent their weakness. So that was a nice thing to add. They have to learn to fight with their weakness or like learn to accept their weakness and all that jazz. The main characters of this show were All Might and Deku, of course. I like Deku because even though everybody said that he can’t be a hero and mock him for his dreams, he didn’t care about them. He scared to death but he tried his best to pursue his dreams and become a hero. Which, I think everybody can relate at some point. Nowadays, it has become almost everybody’s problem. People break others dreams by accident or on purpose. Even though most of the time, a little bit touch is enough for that person to fly. This brings me to All Might. Well, at first I didn’t really like All Might. Because he seems like a dude who really likes to brag about himself or don’t really care about being a hero but show off and gain reputation. But, after a few episodes that I realize that wasn’t the case. Actually, he was under the big responsibility and struggle every day in order to make everybody safe. So yeah, in the end, I  like All Might. And that’s the end of the character review because other characters were just… There. I don’t even know any person’s name. I don’t know, maybe because of the 13 episodes or the fact that there will be another season, the side characters were, side characters. I wished that at least I remember their names. They were kind of dull and really unoriginal so...
So, if I had to summarise my review, I’d say that if you have all the time in the world, whose into action anime and want to binge watch an anime though you don’t really care about the plot, as long as it engrosses you and makes you crave even more… You will like it.",6,Aderinda

                This anime is good in many ways but I feel that the story progresses way too slow for my liking. Furthermore I am a person that likes a lot of plot armour and
Deku was a character that kept on pissing me off.
Reason being how that it never occurred to him that maybe he should train his punches to maybe learn how to some what control it (kinda like how Naruto trained his rasengan and how Shinichi learnt how to use the parasite embedded in his arm.

                If you're a longtime anime fan, sometimes you're just in the mood for a great shonen series. Well, friends, look no further than My Hero Academia if that's what you're in the market for.
In today's media landscape of moral grey areas, antiheros, cynicism about humanity and general malaise, not to mention the complex geopolitical landscape we inhabit in the real world, life can be bleak. There are times when you just want to go back to believing that the good guys always win and that evil can be overcome.
While this a truth I believe will ultimately happen, it can be hard to see sometimes. Shows
                  like My Hero Academia are a good means of escape from the harsh world we live in, and strengthen the values of justice and hope we all have.
The best way to describe MHA is if Harry Potter met Marvel superheroes. Basically, superheroes exist in this world, and there's a superhero academy that trains the best ones. It's pretty simple, but hey, the show knows it and it handles it's conventions expertly.
All the characters are easy to love and it's hard not to root for them. There are some classic shonen tropes in here but they are just refined and played so excellently- the rival dynamic between the MC, Midoriya and his longtime rival, Bakugo, the teachers/masters that reveal their true power when their students are in a pinch, the MC overcoming his humble origins to eventually become something great. What's a true delight to see is how all the students of the academy go from acquaintances to becoming friends as they face the various trials and challenges.
The last 3 episodes are pure shonen at it's most perfect, and there's a moment in episode 12 that sent chills down my spine at how cool it was.
Definitely watch this show if you're in the mood for shonen but don't want to wade through Naruto or tackle HxH (though you should watch that immediately if you like this). You won't regret it.",10,seekr12

                ""My Hero Academia"" is one of those shows that enjoys you at the beginning but bores you at the end. That's what I found out whilst watching the anime, but in overall is a good anime.
Story: 7
The story's main lesson is to ""follow your dreams"" and that's pleasing to hear, since he doesn't give up on being a hero even if he's quirkless and luck made him lucky when his idol gave him his quirk. Izuki faces the obstacles he is being put to, even if Katsuki is a bully to Izuki, he also dreams to be the strongest hero in the world. I have
                  some problems with the story. One, if Izuki's idol, All Might, gave him his quirk, it would be impossible to carefully use the quirk, since he is a fifteen year old. Plus, if he's a random stranger, he shouldn't have said his secrets and gave him his quirk since he needs to be careful about himself. He should've said that ""You... can be a hero even if you're quirkless."" and leave to the next incident. Two, 20% of the population are quirkless, which is unfair to the humans since heroes get a load of money, and how if no heroes are available and a villain is present, how would they fight back / defend themselves? All cons aside, the story is overall a well-written one. 
Art: 8
Now to the art. This is the second most interesting factor in the anime. ""Bones"" I see worked very hard and the other side of me said they took it easy but the arts were beautiful. The animation was in overall interesting. I hope that the art for My Hero Academia get better in Season 2.

Some people agree, some people don't. The sound was a masterpiece. Porno Graffiti and Brian The Sun made a very good job on making ""THE DAY"" and ""HEROES"" as opening / ending themes. Well done.
Character: 5
I've been looking forward to write on this part. The characters weren't balanced on strength. Some were overpowered, some were weak that doesn't deserve to be in Hero class. Why did Minoru & Tooru get in the Hero class anyway? He can be somewhere else fitting.
Enjoyment: 8
Jokes, drama, action, sound, art: Those are the factors on why My Hero Academia is enjoyable. Enjoyment is the main core of everything: when it isn't, so does the anime. I should've rated this 10, but the last five episodes bored me being stuck on USJ. 
In conclusion, My Hero Academia focuses on chasing your dreams, and never giving up. Sure, some might say this is overrated and something similar to One Punch Man (which I didn't watch yet) but it's a good anime that stands up to itself.",7,ralphgay

                To start off, lemme say FINALLY! Finally I was able to watch My Hero Academia. I've waited a long time to watch this but I was very patient. Prior to this I was coming off a very solid superhero series(Tiger and Bunny)and after hearing that this series also involved superheroes, I knew I was gonna watch this soon. Plus many people considered this to be one of the best animes of 2016, so of course I wanted to get into it. Does it meet the expectations ?? After finishing season 1 literally an hour ago here are my thoughts.***contains MINOR spoilers***
Story:8/10
A very compelling story. For
                  one its setting really makes it standout, it gives us a brand new world that being born wit superpowers is normal. What makes this very original is that we're used to watching fictions where people wit powers are the 'freaks"" where in this series it's the opposite. Another thing that impressed me was how well they were able to introduce this in such a small season. The bulk of this season is showing how Deku deals wit his high school journeys that lead to much excitement. The exciting thing is that although this season's story gets to a hot start, it has so much more in store for us for its next season. The only thing that stops me from giving this a perfect score is that it falls a lil bit under the shonen cliché where our protagonist wants to be the best hero and most of the episodes are about his training. However its heartfelt and unique enough for us to watch something a lil different.
Art:10/10
Absolutely astounding. Coming from the same anime studio that animated Fullmetal Alchemist it's safe to say this was no surprise. What I admired here was how well they were able to use this great art to their advantage. They used fluid animation and great camera angles to excel the action sequences, like having high speed movement or big attacks look sharp and dramatic. Also the character design was awesome. Not only did everyone look unique in their own way but they used their designs to solidify their personalities such as the use of outfits and facial expressions. I mean what else can I say, Bones does it again.
Sound:10/10
Great, the series handled this area very well. Lemme be the first to say that this has one of the best English dubs in recent years. Chris Sabat as All Might was a perfect casting choice who has the perfect voice to match his character's persona, Justin Briner did a great job as Deku as he portrayed his nervous moments perfectly. As for the side characters most of them had the right voices that either fit their appearances or personality, then you had some with both like Ochako. The soundtrack overall was very good and mad hype, as it had some action tracks to support the already great action scenes. The OP was very good imo as it was a great choice to hype up the series, as for the ED I wasn't crazy about it although I'm sure there are some that would like it. Most of the tracks were filled with inspirational and heroic sounding themes that greatly supported scenes with excitement and hype. The main theme ""My Hero Academia"" is so EPIC and All Might's theme is great to, although you can argue and say that it sounds too familiar to Superman John Williams' theme tho.
Character:8/10
A very good cast. Like I said before great animes need a great main character and Deku is definitely one. What makes him so great is how relatable and inspiring he can be. He's a kid who knew what his dream was at a very young age and although he was brutally told that it won't come true, he never stops trying anyway. His heroic idol All Might was a very enjoyable character to watch. What I like about him is that although he's the big muscular hero with a great smile, he's actually not perfect. He has this current condition that he has to keep a secret to not only damage his reputation but for society's sake as well. Deku's rival is Katsuki ""Kacchan"" Bakugo, maybe no other anime character resembles Vegeta more than him. An angry kid who suffers from too much pride and strives to be the best for w.e means necessary. My fav thing about him is that we can't tell if he'll end up as a villain or hero. My biggest flaw here are the villains, as they weren't given enough room for development. Although they seem that they can be great their backstories and motives were never cleared leaving them to be irrelevant to the story.
Final Verdict
Pros
+A heartfelt and inspirational high school tale that gives us an awesome new world
+Gorgeous character design that gives each character their own unique look and suits the personalities and quirks
+Gives us a main protagonist that we deeply care about and makes us wanna root for him at all times
+Near perfect animation that handles the action sequences very well
Cons
-Villains need development and motivations must be explored
-Throws in a large diverse cast all at once that need more focus in later seasons
-Comes across as a generic shonen series
Personal Favorites
Characters: Bakugo, All Might, and Aizawa
Arc: USJ
Fight: All Might vs Nomu
Such a great series. My Hero Academia excels in almost all aspects and is another example of how anime is currently stepping up the superhero genre. While some may bash it as another shonen cliché, its compelling storyline, amazing action and diverse cast makes it such an enjoyable series. As for its villain flaws it has a whole another season for them to flesh out. As long as season 2 does that, My Hero Academia could be amongst the all time great anime.

                Man, I should've published this review a lot sooner, since this is the start of my current favorite anime of all time (which is mostly due to it being an adaptation of my second favorite manga of all time). Since I want to write a review of the second season by the time I finish that off, I think I should review the first one, well, first!
Story - 7/10: This anime covers pretty much the exact amount of chapters of manga that are brutally bog standard. Boku no Hero starts as generic as it can get, and I've seen hate for this series from people
                  who dropped it before reaching Season 2 where it really shows its true nature, which is a real shame. Honestly, you pretty much have to trust me when I say that it gets a lot better than this later on!
Art - 10/10: This aspect of both the manga and the anime are Boku no Hero's biggest strength at this point in the story. The cartoony and Western comic book motifs are fantastic and distinct, which is why Horikoshi is my second favorite mangaka of all time. His style is presented in a bright and vibrant way that suits the series well most of the time, although a lot of detail is lost (which is par for the course anyway).
The real plus is the animation though! Bones knows how to animate action and their talent is in flying colors here! The fight at the climax of this season is honestly presented better than it was in the manga.
Characters - 8/10: I swear, the characters in Boku no Hero are all amazing! Just give them time to grow! This season serves the purpose of conveying the personalities of each person in the series, and since everything is Black Clover levels of generic at this point, it's really easy for these personalities to be established...
Izuku is the underdog, Bakugo is the talented jerk, Ochako is the Best Girl, etc. etc. etc. Like I said before, they all seem like Copy-Paste archetypes, but once you get to Season 2 they will become one of the greatest casts of characters in the entire Shounen genre, period.
At the very least, their distinct personalities and extremely varied design- even among minor characters- make them fun to watch in action.
Sound - 9/10: There's nothing really to say here, other than we have some fantastic seiyuus for this show. You can look at the bios here on MAL if you don't believe me. In fact, I couldn't believe half of them were who they were compared to their other roles! (Seriously, somehow, the cool and collected Karma from Anstasu Kyoushitsu is the hot headed Bakugo... how?!)
The band from the very first OP of FMA returns to perform Boku no Hero's first OP, ""The Day"", and... well... the song itself isn't as good as I thought it should've been. If bands like Grandrodeo and Jam Project were worthy of performing the OPs of Kuroko and One Punch Man, they should've also been hired for this show! But oh well, it's really a matter of taste in the end. The visuals of the OP are still pretty rockin' though.
Overall - 10/10: It's a rocky start, but this is still a fantastic first season to a fantastic anime that I think is better presented than the manga up to this point. But honestly, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this show so much if I hadn't known what was coming up ahead of time.
I've seen many, many posts about people who dropped this show and even compare it to BLACK BLOODY CLOVER, and it makes me kind of disappointed. Even though I believe the anime is slightly better than the manga for the time being, I'd still recommend it over this show.
You could easily get through each volume in 45 minutes to an hour, and by halfway into volume 3, you'll already be a good ways into Season 2 material, and as such it would be a lot faster to get over the series' initial hurdle. But honestly, as long as you go in with an open mind and blind trust towards the words of complete strangers, your reward for sticking with this anime's first season will be a fantastic second season and hopefully an even more fantastic third season!",10,Natsuki_Hyundai

                Everytime I hear too much about some anime, I get suspicious. Because most of the times it's gonna be nothing compared to the expectations. This time was no different.
Boku no Hero starts with an awesome proposal: create an intire world of superheros! Just this may charm many people - and it even did it to me. I heard about it from my friend: ""It's such an amazing show! You're gonna get the chills."" 
So, I started watching and somehow got to the end. But what I'm trying to say is that the anime doesn't make you want the next chapter ASAP, it is just a
                  show to pass the time. What really bothers me is how they can put really deep and cool characters and at the same time idiotic and boring ones. Among the teachers and the so called 'superheros' there are plenty. 
I wish I liked it, so I would be here fighting the haters haha, because I really like superheros, mutants, all kinds of supernatural things. X-men is one of my favorite series. Boku no hero was disappointing to me.
I even started watching the second season, but already dropped.",8,hakuryuu-

                Amazing. Gripping. Enjoyable.I really enjoyed this show. It makes me hungry for more. Keep up the good work and have a great day. The first season of My Hero Academia delivers thirteen episodes of fantastic action, elevated by a heartfelt story that's wrapped around a core cast of memorable and relatable characters. My Hero Academia's excellent character design only elevates the memorable cast even further. From Deku's kind and innocent smile to the intimidating stare that emanates from Bakugou's angry eyes, each character has their own distinct look that reflects their personality. I also have to applaud the casting choices and overall voice work, as
                  Yowamushi Pedal's Daiki Yamashita is a perfect fit for Deku in the Japanese version, and Justin Briner does an excellent job as the character in the English dub.",10,czarhans

                I consider myself a strict grader when it comes to anime and I am honestly surprised at the low ratings many of the MAL reviewers have given to the first season of BnHA. 
I do not like to pull this card, but I believe the lower ratings are (mostly) coming from viewers who dislike hyped series. Yes, the series is hyped, but not wrongfully so. BnHA hit the anime world by storm and has been viewed as the successor of the BIG THREE of shounen (One Piece, Naruto, Bleach). 
This big hit series is like the anime of X-Men and you may all be thinking
                  to yourselves ""Cope, that is unbelievably unoriginal"". I look at it a different way. How can an author possibly build a new world of heroes with superpowers and draw in fans when our society is so insanely oversaturated with superheroes already? The answer, I think is better answered by watching this for yourself.
I will confess to a bias; the first season of BnHA is what truly made me fall in love with anime. Before this, I had only watched Naruto+Shippuden, DB/DBZ and Bleach. My friend had to force me to try this series, and at the time, I was very reluctant because I used to be one of those people with a negative stigma towards anime (Yes, those people are the worst). 
But that is what makes Boku no Hero Academia a near-masterpiece in my eyes. It shattered that negative stigma for me and changed my perspective of anime. With all the anime I have watched, my friends all think I have been watching anime for over a decade. But for me, the glory started here.",9,copewhiskey
31964,"
                Oh boy, time to go dumpster diving.
Where do I even start? 
Story:
The story is an unappealing mishmash of arcs that are the exact same, pathetic excuses of characters that redefined the word ""garbage"" and straight-up unoriginality which is so prevalent within Horikoshi's writing that I'm impressed he had the balls to call this a series. Half of the time this feels like some crappy AU of Naruto, because the characters are the exact same. At the beginning of the show, BOOM! No more suspense. ""This is the story of how I became the greatest hero."" My previous review was removed, so I'll treat this anime
                  as delicately as I can.
Art:
Okay, I have to admit, the art is beautiful. Horikoshi can't write for shit, but he can draw WELL. The art style is captivating when put onto the big screen, and aside from a few mishaps, it is quite appealing. The sheer beauty of the art was the apple of my eye when I first picked up this series, even hypnotizing me into thinking this was a good series until I realized I was watching Naruto the whole time. Overall, the art is the only good point in this terrible sea of suffering that many people come to know as the ""king of shonen"".
Character: 
Deku is a Mary Sue, who seems to have interesting writing if you are completely new to any form of fiction, but turns out to be generic and a sorry, pathetic rip-off of Naruto. His abilities are interesting, or would have been, had One For All's primary gimmick served NOTHING to the storyline except an excuse to not make him Saitama levels of overpowered. Bakugo is your everyday stock image bully. All Might is the only interesting character, and that's because of his backstory. I could go on for days, but I'll spare you the grisly details.
Overall: 2/10. Only recommended as a niche first anime, if you are into low standards.",2,hamburger241111

                I'm not some genius entrepreneur of anime like everyone and their mom on this website so i'll make it simple.
I hate generic average anime, a lot of shounen end up being the same bullshit. Boku no hero isn't generic but obviously it has similarities to other shounen; Being the same genre there is only so much a shounen can be different from the others. I've read a lot of the low reviews here its mostly(not all) just people who hate shounen anime.
The story is touching, a well done zero to hero it reminds me of naruto.
The characters aren't too overpowered each quirk has some sort
                  of repercussion if used too much or in a certain way.
Soundtrack is 20/10 on this one
animations are pretty good, couldn't really ask for much more.",9,lilbuffkitty

                *Spoilers*
You know, this was pretty solid. It didn't blow me away or underwhelm me. It was just pretty good. The story isn't too complicated, never once going beyond what you would expect from an action Shounen, but it's pretty entertaining nonetheless. The characters aren't amazing, but you get where they're coming from and can empathize with them to a some extent. This first season really only focuses on Deku, Bakugo and All might, leaving everyone else as background characters, which I expect will change in the next seasons. All of the supporting characters seem interesting and I can't wait for the show to explore all
                  of them more.
The conflict between Deku and Bakugo was pretty entertaining to watch and All Might's handicap was a really interesting aspect of the show. It added a slight layer of uncertainty, though I wish that they had capitalized on it a bit more. All Might's fight with Nomu would've been a lot more impactful if All Might hadn't been able to save Deku when he and Bakugo were attacked by the sludge monster. If someone else had done it, there would've been a lot more uncertainty about his ability, making the final fight more exciting.
That aside, the animation and score were both amazing. You Say Run is a pretty great theme by any standard and the Sakuga in the last couple of episodes was impressive. Aizawa's fight sequences were super dynamic and engaging and All Might's fight completely delivered an explosive fight scene. 
Overall, this season was pretty solid, but it didn't impress me beyond what I was expecting. What really interests me are all the characters that this show can explore and the world building that is yet to be done. Hoping season 2 kicks it up a notch.",7,Hudsonwt

                I've been a fan of anime and manga for 15 years so I had watched & read many series. Boku no Hero Academia/My Hero Academia is one of the latest famous series from Shonen Jump, so I've been following the manga since end of 2015 until now. There's several manga that I like but I don't like the anime (e.g. One Piece). But for My Hero Academia, I like both the manga and the anime.
If you asked me whether My Hero Academia offer something new to Shonen genre, I will say not yet. So far, it gives me ""been there, done that"" feels. But it's
                  done in a good way, so I couldn't help to love it anyway. So, here are my review:
Story: 8
The story of My Hero Academia can divide people into 2, those who think it's childish and those who think it's heartwarming. Well, I'm the later. 
It's true that it has simple premise, the story is pretty straightforward and so far there's not many complex things in it. So, don't hope for a more complex story like Deathnote, Fullmetal Alchemist, or 20th Century Boy. But for me, who's already read too many complex stories, who's life is full of complicated things (Imagine you're 30s, busy, and your job' life suck), the simplicity of My Hero Academia is a plus point. The ""childish"" nature of the story reminds me so much with my childhood where I'm still full of dreams and haven't become a cynical people yet.  It's refreshing.
My Hero Academia take place in the future where 80% of human population have special powers called ""quirk"". Due to rise of people with superpowers, the criminal rate is also exploding and the world come into chaos. But this is also make a profession come into the limelight. Heroes fighting villains, saving people, and now become an established position where they are paid by the government based on their performance. This manga follow story of the main protagonist on his journey to be the greatest hero, starting from his high school days in hero course of the elite U.A High School.
Art: 8
Studio Bones made some of my favorite anime, like FMA and FMA brotherhood. Their quality is consistent. It's good.
Sound: 8
I love the OST. The composer is the same with the one of composer of Haikyuu OST. Porno Graffiti is one of old band from Japan that I like since 2000s so I'm really glad they sing the Opening Theme. The Ending Theme is also quite good.
Character: 8
The characters of My Hero Academia can also divide people into 2, those who like it and those who don't. Some people might complain that the main protagonist (Izuku Midoriya) is too weak. As a person who read the manga, I can say that Izuku become more powerful as the series progress. Don't judge him just after 13 episodes. If you want a protagonist who always win or strong from the start, don't watch this series. 
If there's something from My Hero Academia that I wish to be better, it's about the villain. The villains, particularly the villain from the 1st season of the anime is underdeveloped.
This series has massive characters that become more massive in the further episodes. But I think it has done a good job to focus on the main protagonist first and introduce the other characters little by little.
Enjoyment: 8
I enjoy watching this series. 
Overall: 8
If you want a light series with heartwarming stories, various characters and actions, you might like this anime. Even if you don't really like the first season, you might like the second season since the story of the series become more and more interesting in the manga.",8,Lady_Senjou

                While not the start of my craze for this franchise it for sure sits at the bottom of the 3 seasons aired so far (at the time of writing this). A couple of my friends that i talked to about this tended to have a common opinion of: ""It would've been more interesting if Deku never got All Might's quirk"". I disagree entirely. The first season is nothing more than a celebration of tropes and cliches that are numerous in a superhero style story where we follow a protagonist that quite literally goes from zero to hero in such a polished fashion. There tends to
                  be little to no ambiguity with the characters it presents in the first season. We see an eager boy wanting to do everything he possibly can to become a hero against all odds, the super famous hero who's time is very limited, a group of supporting heroes for our boy we follow and a largely stereotypical group of big bads attacking our good boys.
This show doesn't skimp or tread that it's different from its contemporaries, instead choosing to relish in it and polish every aspect of these storytelling elements. So why even though I wear my massive bias for this show as a badge of honor rate this show as a 7/10 when I will probably rate every season going forward a 10/10? What we see of the characters thus far while I love all the cheesy superhero stuff it ultimately brings it down and mainly serves as building blocks for a much more interesting character driven story figuring out the righteousness of heroes and villains in its world. Trying my best to not convey a hard comparison but simply put what happens in the course of season 1 while good, is largely passable with some really technical qualities.",7,Rulerofpie

                My hero academia is a popular shone battle series revolving about kids in school with powers called quirks. With the story, the story is very simple heroes at school fighting villains. The story is pretty inspiring following the main characters. I give a seven out of 10 because the plot is nothing special. Some things also the comedy Is kinda unfunny. The thing that ruins it is the fights feel like just punching nothing else. It uses hype to make its fights feel better but they really aren’t. Even gurren Lagann used some actual fighting,
The animation is amazing as shown with title sequence. The fights
                  are very beautifully animated.  There is nothing to really say. Just normal art style but pretty well done.
The sound is one of the best I hard so far in anime. The show starts with ops that make you excited for the coming episodes. The music adds so much epic ness to the fights. The music just wants you to listen over and over again. The songs are used great for the moods in the series.
The characters are bad. They are just boring. The main character is a little unique and changes but is so annoying. All he really is Is an inspiration to the audience made to be perfectly in inspiring with no actual character beyond that. He is basically blah blah blah I want powers blah blah blah. He creeps screaming and is so annoying. Mac ah none of the rivals can’t stop being mean to the mc he’s just like I’m better than everyone blah blah blah no changes nothing just constant screaming.

The concept is extremely interesting and cool but it has a lot of plot holes (at least in the anime). It is enjoyable to watch and the charcters are extremely lovable but the series just lacks depth. We know next to nothing about bakugo, tsuyu, kaminari, and literally all of the other characters, including

                REVIEW EM PORTUGUÊS (NO FINAL)
It is a great anime for those who like action and adventure! It has charismatic characters, a good story and a very interesting universe, since the fact that each person has a different power, makes you want to know more and more about how the powers can be used and how powerful the characters are! In the end, it is quite interesting to see the growth of the characters, both in personality and power.
The collegiate atmosphere is also present throughout the series, which is very cool, because it brings a certain nostalgia to the elders and an identification with the situations
                  to the younger ones! It reminds you a bit of the feeling of watching the animation: ""X-Men Evolution""; teenagers with super powers, conflicts and adventures (and a dash of romance)!
With epic fights, those of shivering, the anime will excite you! Scenes in which important characters suffer serious injuries, and the protagonist fails when he could not fail or lose, even trying to win, help generate a minimal sense of ""real danger"", which gives strength to adventure and undoes certain clichés.
If you are a fan of the genre, you will love watching Boku no Hero!
-----------------------------
PORTUGUÊS:
É um ótimo anime para quem gosta de ação e aventura! Ele tem personagens carismáticos, uma boa história e um universo muito interessante, uma vez que o fato de que cada pessoa tem um poder diferente, faz você querer saber mais e mais sobre como os poderes podem ser usados ​​e como poderoso os personagens são! No final, é bastante interessante ver o crescimento dos personagens, tanto em personalidade quanto em poder.
O clima colegiado também está presente em toda a série, o que é muito legal, pois traz nostalgia aos mais velhos e uma identificação com as situações para os mais jovens! Isso lembra a sensação de assistir a animação: ""X-Men Evolution""; adolescentes com superpoderes, conflitos e aventuras (e uma pitada de romance)!
Com lutas épicas, aquelas de arrepiar, o anime vai te excitar! Cenas em que personagens importantes sofrem ferimentos graves, e o protagonista falha quando não pode falhar ou perder, mesmo tentando ganhar, ajuda a gerar o mínimo sentido de ""perigo real"", que dá força à aventura e desfaz certos clichês.

                My Hero Academia is a heartfelt love letter to comic book heroes that features some of the best storytelling, action, and animation that the anime medium has seen in years. The story follows Izuku Midoriya, as he trains under All Might, the world's most powerful superhuman, and other pro heroes alongside his superpowered classmates at a school for up-and-coming superheroes. Many anime have arcs that feel lacking or unnecessary, but My Hero Academia uses its biggest strength - a tremendous roster of charming, quirky heroes and interesting villains - to ensure that even the (very few) slower episodes are full of hilarious and touching moments

                I enjoyed watching this show. I think there is so much that they can do with this concept. The action scenes are amazing, character development is slow but engaging. Story is basic, not very complex. Soundtrack is literally on a very high level that really makes the experience of the show much better. I love the ANIMATION. I just do! It’s quite sharp yet traditional. Overall, this show is a very good anime, which will keep you hooked only if you are not looking for a specific anime of a certain genre. Also, this anime doesn’t fail to inspire anyone. It’s probably the best shounen
                  jump we have at the moment in 2018. The anime could be more complex over the period of 3 or 4 years. I think this anime is one of those ‘700 episodes and still popular type’ anime.",8,clergyboy_

                [Story: 9] I absolutely loved the story. One, I never watch an anime unless it was a shoujo/romance but my friends kept telling me to watch it. I gave it shot and the only reason I kept watching was because of the story. I love how we get to see the main character grow and develop his own skills, his quirks and his personality. There was never a dull moment and I was constantly watching to see what would happen next. I enjoyed how the ending would continue in the next season. A good cliff hanger.
[Art: 8] I don't know much about art but I
                  like this anime art. Each character appears differently based on their quirks. And I enjoy that tiny detail. Maybe other anime does it, and I am glad that this anime also did this. 
[Sound: 8] I also don't know much about sound. I assume this is speaking about ost and dramatic music. I like the beginning and ending ost. Wasn't as catchy as I thought it would be but still pretty good. I didn't like how in the beginning ost, it foreshadow what would occur in the end. Just my opinion.
[Character: 10] I LOVE the characters in this anime. Each one is unique and fits well with their quirks. I also enjoy how they are also developing along side the main character. Not as noticeable but still shows how they grow to Deku. Absolutely loved the characters. 
[Enjoyment: 9] I was constantly reeled into the story. There was never a dull moment. I believe I watched around 5 episodes in a day and I knew this anime was dangerous. I could waste away a day and never know it until I looked at the time. I literally had to pace myself so that I could be productive and enjoy the anime. 
[Overall: 9] I enjoyed this anime so much. I know I only have seen only a small amount since I still have to watch the rest of the seasons. I can't wait to see what is to come for the characters! PLUS ULTRA!",9,ItsAngelAri

                I almost don't want to do a broken down review of this show like I normally do because I would love to just fan over it, but that's not always as convincing. Plus (ultra), this show deserve a review with more effort than that.
Story 10/10: If you're tired of every show each season trying to be the next edgy or over-the-top shounen, then this show is for you. This is a very back to its roots shounen that has all of the requirements for a shounen that you may not admit that you want, but is presented through fresh, energetic, and optimistic young eyes. you
                  get what bits of school life you need in addition to all the action you could ask for. Midoriya is an objectively lovable character that is meant for every viewer to relate to on even a small level with his journey from being ""quirkless"" (powerless)to inheriting a power that he is far from handling. Similar to the cornerstone shounen, DBZ, Midoriya wins, loses, trains, and sometimes doesn't always come out the victor, but with BNHA it's the journey that matters. 
***Spoiler-not-spoiler*** Season two STARTS WITH and has possibly the greatest tournament arc I've ever seen: it introduces new characters and develops them in no time at all, it showcases the main characters using their powers in new ways, and then tops it off with the straightforward fighting that you crave from tournament arcs.
Art 10/10: The colors are beautiful, the character designs are amazing, and I think quite possibly my favorite thing about BNHA is that in a world full of people with different quirks (powers) there are some quirks that cause physical differences (examples being one character that has tape dispenser elbows and another that looks like a purple alien). The fact that not only are some quirks out-of-the-ordinary like that, but that the physical aspects of them are considered, the art in this show truly lives to please. 
Sound 10/10: rarely do I have opinions on the soundtrack of shows, but BNHA has a great everyday soundtrack as well as OP that are on point.
Character 10/10: Even though Midoriya is the main character, there will be AT LEAST five other characters that you will be willing to die for. Midoriya's mentor, All Might, is a genuinely lovable guy to an almost surprising point given his hero image. As for the rest of class 1-A, every character is so well developed right from the start that you think they can't get any better, but possibly the most amazing thing about BNHA is that the characters are always developing (to the point where I'm crying during most episodes, mainly in season two). One important bonus to this all is that even the villains end up getting development time (primarily in season 2) The exception to all of this is the entire fandom having a dislike of Mineta. The real kicker, there is no wrong answer to the question of who is best girl!
Enjoyment 10/10: I love character development, I love action, I love school shenanigans, and I love any show that can make me cry. Put all of those together and you get BNHA.
Overall 10/10: Very rarely do I find a show that I enjoy so much that the usual one a week updating isn't enough for me, but BNHA got me to the point that I binged the manga after enough time of not being able to wait. I can't stress enough that this show has everything someone could ask for; not just from a shounen, but from any anime in general. What I don't think I have mentioned this entire time is that because of the hero school theme you almost want to think of this series as X-Men without the racism allegory because of how quirks are a part of everyday society, but many of the powers are so unique that you are able to quickly draw yourself away from all of that (examples being bird face with a dark shadow living in him, a naval laser, calf engines, and blood paralysis)",10,Prof_Telperion

                My Hero Academia is by no means ""original"". We've had stories about teenage superheroes before, about superhero schools/colleges/universities, even about the ""lame"" main character with no powers who somehow overcame it all and became one of the (if not THE) best superheroes ever.
BUT...
It's still a damn good and entertaining story. And at the end of the day, that's what I value more: the level of ~fun~ I had while watching something.
I loved almost all of the characters (the only one I didn't like was Kacchan... he's INSUFFERABLE, I couldn't make myself like him at all. Hopefully, the next seasons will change that), I felt that
                  every character had a different quirk and personality and design. Izuku is easily likable (even with all the crying), All Might is surprisingly encouraging (my first impression of him was that he'd be an asshole, I'm so glad I was wrong lol), Ochako is one of the sweetest characters I've ever encountered... I could go on and on about those characters haha
I'd say that's the strongest part of the anime. You actually get to care about those characters, holding your breath when they're in danger and hoping that somehow they'll get away safely. And at the same time, when it comes to the villains, you hope THEY get to kill everyone and mess everything up! LOL
At first I didn't like the opening, but it grew on me, so that's a plus. I loved the ending at first sight (at first... listen?), and that's a rare thing because most of the time I dislike the ending and just skip to the next episode. But with My Hero Academia, I watch both the opening and the ending :) they're worth it
Anyway... My Hero Academia was a nice surprise for me because I expected it to be just another silly fighting shounen, but instead, got an actual fun shounen with just the right amounts of comedy and drama. I definitely recommend it!",8,isahbellah
31964,"
                This to me is a example of how to make a anime.   Everything about it is perfect, it plays with the traditions of a super hero series, but also creates a world of it's own and makes it unique.
Story:   The story follows a young kid that doesn't have super powers, in a world where almost everyone his age does, and him growing and living in this world I won't spoil things, but while you can see where things will go, the journey is perfectly shown.
Art:   I love the art style, it's a good blend of action and colours. 
                   Every fight feels real and vibrant, this shows that you can be serious and have deep emotional scenes without making everything gray.
Characters:   One of the best parts, everyone is unique, their powers are unique, and there is depth to everyone.   It's one of it's best parts.
Enjoyment and overall:   I've watched the second season and it's in some ways better then the first, but this is still a great season and series, this is one I hope we see many more seasons of as it just blends everything you want perfectly.",10,wolfwing

                I refuse to review every season of this show. Not because its bad, but because I cannot remember what I am remembering from which season. 
Overall its a very enjoyable show. 
The characters are fun and very Anime.
I personally like that no one in this community seems to care that a certain character bullied the main character for years, but if one other random character is just barely not-nice towards the main cast, they all go rabid. Weird people through and through.
The story is fun and very shonen, but the themes are barebones.
The comedy has its moments, but nothing stands out. Although I like the
                  Superman person very much. 
The Antagonists are actually all pretty well written, which surprised me. 
The music is better than I expected. 
A very typical shonen that exceeded my expectations in a few places. I recommend trying out the first season, but if you like shonen you will like this show. Well, if you like shonen you probably like everything, so there is that. 
Its not a very special show, but I believe it gets better in the later seasons. 
Season 1 is a 6/10 because it is very much filled with typical tropes, more than the other seasons from what I can remember.",6,trumpapa
31964,"
                Story 7/10
The story is hardly complex and is pretty generic in my view but for what it is it is done well and the story's pacing is also excellent.
Art 7/10
The characters and locations are drawn well for the most part with the art only suffering in my view at some of the cringe worthy moments particularly when the main character acts like a cry baby.
Sound 8/10
The opening and closing themes are both of high quality and the sound effects work well.
Character 7/10
The main character Midoriya is a generic cry baby protagonist but some of the other characters are a bit better although by the end
                  of the first season I feel like we are only just being introduced and I am looking forward to seeing how they develop in the future.
Enjoyment 9/10
Despite the generic story and main character I found myself really getting into this by the end of the first season I have learned to love cheering on Midoriya and most of his fellow students and am excited to see what happens in their story next.
Overall 8/10
A  super fun show well worth watching and with a few seasons already available to watch now's a great time to check this out.",8,WhiteTail8

                My Hero Academia  is a really good starting anime. If you want to get into anime, I would recommend this because of it's lighthearted nature and fun story line. However, for anyone who's watched a few animes, My Hero is not really the move. It's very generic and tends to be very predictable when compared to other animes. This used to be my favorite anime until I started watching more animes and realized how overrated this series really is. 
Story- 7/10
I personally think that the concept was perfect. People being born with different and unique powers is a really interesting concept and I really
                  enjoyed it in the beginning. However, I find that this anime is really predictable. I feel like whenever a problem arises, I know exactly what's going to happen. There's almost no surprises in this anime, and it got boring to me after a while.
Art- 8/10
One thing about this anime that I actually enjoy is the art. The animation and the character designs are really smooth and usually visually pleasing. The art style isn't anything special, but the character designs to me is really what makes the art in this series good.
Sound-6/10
To be completely honest, I really don't vibe with any of the openings in this series. There were pretty average, and weren't anything worth downloading on my phone. Even the closings weren't that good either. I just really didn't vibe with it much overall.
Character- 9/10
Another thing I really enjoy about this series, (and ultimately what kept me watching) was the characters. I like that the series goes in depth with most characters and their backstories. I also really enjoy the character development that the characters go through as well as the character designs themselves. I really enjoyed this aspect of the anime.
Enjoyment- 7/10
Again, it's enjoyable if you're getting into anime but once you've watched some better ones they make this anime look bad. After a while, it gets boring when you know exactly what's going to happen. 
Overall-7/10
My Hero Academia has some real potential to be a good anime , it's just missing a wow factor for me. Nothing about it is surprising, however I do enjoy a lot of the characters and the concept of the overall story.",7,emilymckevittt

                I am writing this as a review for all of the current my hero academia episodes and seasons because I'm a damn lazy bum.
I think the MHA series is fine. I don't hate it nor do I particularly love it. it was fine. 
My Hero has a great concept but the same thing has been done time and time again however I think the show executes it very well. 
Before I talk about what I dislike I'm going to point out the things I like about the show. First of all the music and sound used for the show really brings it together. I love
                  most of if not all of the shows sounds and it does a really great job at hyping you up and I sometimes catch myself listening to the soundtrack on my own without watching the anime. 
Secondly I think all of the elements being there and being done decently and none of them lacking too much really helps the show because it is not being dragged down in any aspect. This really helped the show be consistent and very enjoyable for me.  During my time watching the show although I thought it had been done before time and time again I couldn't help but think it was done very well. When I watched the show the entire time I enjoyed myself to a decent degree.
To comment on Boku no Hero's art style I think again to describe it I would have to say consistent but average. The art style of the show was solid most of the way through. It still struggles with the classic anime derp faces from time to time, you can just search on YouTube my hero academia derp animation moments or something like that, I'm sure someone has made it. However on the other hand the show has it's moments where the animation is really nice and is powerful and can show the action and everything very well. Sometimes bad sometimes good so I'll give the animation an average score. 
Now to talk about what I disliked from the the series.
I would like to talk about the characters. Now I think if I had to to describe the entire body of characters as a spice it would be god damn flour. Maybe flour with a small tiny one crank of pepper in it but still flour. I fell asleep thinking about the body of character writing their reviews. All of them are pretty generic compared to the cast of other shows. Instead of each character being their own spice it's like each character is a tub of flower with a bit of something mixed in. Even the main character is just as generic as generic gets. 
And finally the story is pretty generic but with all of the other things stated I'll give it an average. Nothing special at all.  Also we know the main character is at absolutely 0% risk of dying because we hear him narrate from the future at the beginning of the show. Although I don't think the main character dying should happen in this show I think it's just annoying that they instantly take a lot of tension off all of his fights with this.
All things considered out of 10 I would give this show an 8. It's an above average show but still very generic and not without it's flaws. Still enjoyable and I think people should watch it. 
However,
I am going to drop the overall of this show down to a 7 because of the horrendous fanbase. I'm sorry if you're included in the fanbase but there is a lot of things in the MHA fanbase that happens that's disgraceful and tarnishes not only the anime but all of anime. Now don't get me wrong I have nothing again the LGBTQIA+ community but the Boku no Hero community is infamous for making homosexual non cannon ships, there would be nothing wrong with that if the people behind the ships didn't seem to think that they have to defend their ships with their lives and even go so far to attack other peoples views on the characters because they dislike them. It's genuinely so awful. There's a lot more to talk about with the community but think about it this way, it was a barrel of apples but a couple of bad ones makes the whole barrel rotten. 
If you are going to watch the show I encourage it but I would not recommend you get too involved with the community as in my experience they have been awful.
Thank you.",7,Toondi

                Quote- “Heroes and villains both thrive on violence, but we’re still categorized. “You’re good” “You’re evil”. That’s how it is! Symbol of peace? Hah! In the end you’re just a tool for violence, made to keep us down. And violence only breeds more violence.” – Shigaraki Tomura
TL;DR- Quirks are so called superpowers that have slowly affected 80 percent of the human population allowing regular humans to manifest physically impossible feats, from shapeshifting to super speed. This has thrown the power balance of the world off, with more and more quirk related incidents occurring, the government sets up its own version of quirk wielding police force-
                  called heroes. deku has grown up during the peak of the heroes, admiring the one that stands above them all the most - All Might. But lo and behold, dekuhas no quirk for himself as he wasn’t born with one so his dream of become someone who can become the #1 hero is impossible to achieve. Heartbroken, he gets mixed up in a bad situation where he meets All Might, and learns that his powers are inherited through generations to maintain peace. With this quirk passed onto him, he now sets off to join UA High, which specialises in rearing up the next set of heroes with his dream still intact.
Similar- 
Assassination classroom- both are set in a school environment with a world renown teacher- all might in mha and koro who is famous for the wrong things. There are a lot of parallels with the characters, with nagisa and izuku wanting to be the best just like their teachers, the violent prodigies in karma and bakugou and so on and so forth. Both are focused on a relatively slow paced underdog theme, with brilliant action scenes and enticing story lines that don't shy away from darker topics. All characters are extremely well developed in both series and have distinct backgrounds that reflect in their personalities which is a treat to see in the shounen genre.
Fire force- In a similar vein, fire force’s main character, shinra, tries his utmost best to become a hero even with his bad circumstances. Both share plenty from a colourful cast to a gripping story line and well written villains that are distinctly evil but air on the side of not evil at the same time. It has a similar plot where some people gain powers to control fire and some people dont.They both are battle action shounen with beautiful fight scenes that are entrancing and the overarching plot is quite good. Fire force, as I said in my review linked in the card above or the description below, does have a lot of fan service, which if that’s your cup of tea, go ahead. 
Art- Drawn by studio bones which is renown for its work such as FMA Brotherhood, cowboy bebop to name a few the art style does not disappoint. This anime is stylistically like watching a comic read itself, which plays well into the overall theme of the show; a cliche story executed as perfectly as possible. The art is charming and thus extremely nice to watch with relatively simple yet effective character designs that are easily distinguishable. The fight scenes are brilliant to watch and enjoy as they probably spent the main portion of their budget animating these scenes which was a great choice in my opinion. The animation does have its shortcomings, feeling clunky and unnatural at times but what can be considered natural in a world of superpowers?
Music- All the songs produced for this anime hav a catchy hopeful tone which does well to add to the scenes portrayed. The background music set the scene rather than the other way round and complemented fight scenes to be more energetic and get the adrenaline pumping. The music was so catchy that I’d get goosebumps when I hear the opening being played in a fight scene since that was the signal for some great stuff to happen. The ed was also brilliant with its pleasing lyrics that matched the anime and was light hearted in nature, which stuck with the memo of this overall show on the surface.
VA-  Voice acting was great too, as the VA’s did well to convey the character emotions through their speech. Deku’s, all might’s and Bakugo’s deserve a lot of praise, with deku doing well to sound hopeful in most of the scenes, desperate in others and in pain during fights. All mights VA switched between the more bravado and showing off tone to be more meek when he was comfortable showing his quirkless form. Bakugo’s did well to sound extremely confident and condescending whilst having hints that in fact he did care about how he was perceived but couldn’t outwardly show it.

Themes 
This anime plays a lot with the ideas of selfishness vs altruism. Altruism as defined by oxford languages is the behaviour of helping another at your own expense. In the school, we see this ideology reflected with bakugo and deku. Deku is on the far side of the altruist scale, harming his body every time he uses one for all for someone else as he can't control the toll it takes on his body whilst bakugo uses his powers to become better at other’s expense. This divide causes bakugo to be the one of the most powerful in his class and thus has merited him many achievements but he’s socially isolated as the other fear that they’ll be used as a stepping stone for him rather than a friend and an equal. For deku, sacrificing himself has netted him a lot of awards in his friendship group but he lacks behind with his confidence and his body is slowly becoming weaker and weaker due to him going through cycles of destroying it and rebuilding it. Imitation is also thrown around in this series as deku tries to imitate all might at the cost of himself whilst bakugo tries to make a name for himself. Thus again we see deku being altruistic by throwing out what he is in order to save others and bakugo being selfish as we see him believe that it is his own path to carve. Neither one is inherently wrong or right which is a central theme this show plays with. According to a study, the thing that separates humans from apes is that we show time and time out that we would sacrifice ourselves for the greater good if need be. Another study found that evidence from population groups ranging from newborns, adopted children, incarcerated juveniles, twins and mindfulness meditators point to the important role of neuroplasticity in response to personal experience and cultural influences in determining behavior in the selfish–selfless spectrum so even if we have a predisposition to be altruistic, we also have a predisposition to be selfish at the same time. The hypothesis is that when humans started to become more interconnected through communities, those who were altruistic were more likely to survive and thus the corresponding genes were passed down and behaviour patterns were taught to the newer generations, leading to both being selfish and selfless being highly connected.  Back to my hero academia, we can also see this contradiction reflected in the villains, with one of my favourite villains of my hero academia being stain. Stain isn’t necessarily evil, he wants to rid the world of those heroes who fight without being altruistic as in his opinion these people aren't heroes but government sanctioned fighters. Stain sacrifices himself in order to make people realise that the heroes are acting more and more like this is just a popularity contest, as evident by the hero rankings, rather than allowing the city to go through meaningful change. He looks at endeavour in disgust as the only thing stain can see in endeavour is a man who will forever be in the shadow of all might and thus fights for himself - to make himself more powerful than all might and reach the number 1 hero rather than someone who fights for the people. You look at another villain such as shigaraki, who just wants to kill all might so that his vision of society is realised. See the difference here? Stain sacrifices himself so others can reach the decision of what a great society should be whilst shigaraki wants to sacrifice others to get his vision of a perfect society. Speaking about the rankings, they also play into the same idea, the rankings inherently lean towards selfishness as they give happiness to the ones on the rankings rather than the people who the heroes are supposed to protect. The people do like the rankings, but they ultimately serve as an ego booster for the heroes and a false promise for the people to believe in as the rankings are based on many factors other than the amount of people saved because if so, endeavour would be the number one hero as its mentioned many times he has the most criminal subjugations for any hero ever. However, all might is the number one hero since he blends both selfishness and altruism incredibly well. He embodies the idea of hope with his ridiculous smile backed up by his immense strength. People can thus believe in his idea of hope as he seems to enjoy what he is doing, that is helping others, whilst also blending in his selfishness in the form of being adorned as the number one hero and having a lot of merch and so fans of himself. Bakugo questions whether Deku’s admiration is correct as the way he sees all might is not wrong- he sees all might as the strongest hero, whilst deku sees him as the symbol for altruism. We see all might admit both of thess after deku and bakugos seconds fight where he says something along the lines of that if you focus too much on winning or saving someone else, you lose the ability to maintain justice as a hero. Ultimately, the number one hero believes that to be a hero you need to selfishly save others at the same time, that is to say you must maintain balance between being true to your desires and wanting to help others.
Thoughts
As I had mentioned earlier, this story is nothing really new, but it's a story that has cliche tropes executed with the most perfection and attention to detail. It’s a pretty standard battle shounen that brings in tropes in subtle yet unobtrusive ways that make the watcher think and reconsider things. The theme covered in the show can be dark but it maintains a light hearted undertone throughout with us rooting for the entirety of UA high, not just deku. The characters are written well, with clear and established reactions to situations with bakugo resorting to the easier yet most violent option and deku resorting to the hardest yet most peaceful option. The dichotomy of the characters and themes in the plot play well with the entirety of the show as it's kept subtle yet obvious. To the average viewer, this anime is great but to me it is brilliant just due to how much I had missed during the first watch of this show.The story is good because of the fact that it is average.
Overall, I enjoyed this anime as it did throw in some curveballs and questions that are relevant to my day to day life, am I going to be altruistic or selfish, and then it did incredibly well to answer those same questions but ultimately the responsibility falls on us the viewer to decide. If anything, spend some time thinking which side you lean on, dekus and stains, bakugos and shigarakis or all mights.",8,LeviathanHWD

                My Hero Academia is one of the most over-hyped anime out there and if you are wanting to watch this show I recommend you to read my review and other's too because for some people it may be a hit but for others like me it was a miss.
Story  - 3/10 
This is one of the negative side of this show, since it is very bland and somewhat childish. The story starts of with this boy or rather a fanboy named Midoriya who wants to become a hero but has no quirk/power like any normal people, so he cant be one. But, the world's
                  best hero named All Might passes his ""secret"" power to him named One for all meaning that it is a power which can be passed to generations to generations. The protagonist Midoriya then trains to use the power and then joins the world's most hardest hero academy to join named UA academy and the story just shows the training and matches they do in the academy. They once were going to a place to train but gets interrupted by this villain gang who wants to kill All Might and then they fight them and All Might comes there too and they win. It was fun for the first 3 episodes or so but it felt boring for me as it went on....
Art and Animation - 8/10
This is by far the best thing of My Hero Academia, Studio. Bones really did great with this animation and art aka the studio of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (haven't watched it yet). The design's of the characters look really good and its very bright and colorful and suits the theme of this anime very well! 
Sound - 6/10
The background music's are just as plain as any anime's have. It isn't outstanding nor terrible, its just as normal as any other anime's have. Openings and Endings are very plain, not very catchy but again is not terrible. 
Characters - 1/10
The worst part of My Hero Academia.... I want to see more of the students other than the 4 main students (Midoriya, Lida, Uraraka, Bakugo), its just does not give anyone else some development ( in s1). At least, it does give details about the main characters 
Enjoyment - 5/10
It is very boring at times, and it never fails to piss me off on every single episode, sometimes gets childish but it has funny scenes here and there so I can give some credit to Enjoyment! 
Overall -4/10
I enjoy this show but sometimes its annoying to watch without thinking about the mistakes  but overall its just fine. I recommend you to watch at least 2 episodes to see what the story is and what type of anime it is.",4,spsrk111

                I am completely blinded by bias but this season made me fall in love with anime. As well as giving inspiration to become better. The story of deku and the struggle he goes through in this season can really be felt. I can help but now how Deku feels when everyone shuts down his dreams. As well as really liking his rivalry with Bakugou. The perfect start for a series.The side characters are enjoyable. Also full with emotional and hype moments. The opening is a banger and the music is really well made. Although not as hype as the other seasons but definitely my favorite
                  out of all of them.",10,SamuelSpunky

                The simplicity of the plot and setting for this anime is what many would call ""nothing special"". Not to mention the art style and colouring for this anime is relatively simple (though it looks cooler in the manga), and unfortunately would prompt many to label this show as a kid's show, especially with the whole ""Superhero"" setting. To put it simply, the general attractiveness for this show is not that great. However, I read many great reviews about it and still decided to watch it anyway. Oh man, I was not disappointed at all!!!! 
Season 1 was generally pleasant and easy to watch, since it
                  only had 12 episodes.The show started off with a nice background on the main characters but with not too much focus, which was something I really like since I can't stand shows that focus too much on characters that I couldn't care less about. I wouldn't say that the first few episodes was enough to spark off any interest. It actually takes a little bit of patience and understanding to bear with the childish-like setting and introduction, but the pacing was bearable and not too slow. It finally ended with the establishment of several long-term antagonists, so I felt that this show had potential but the it was not enough for me to call it ""excellent"". The best thing about season 1 was the development of the main character (Izuku)'s powers/quirks!! It was really exciting to watch!
I recently started watching Season 2 and man, it really sets the suspense of the entire story to ANOTHER LEVEL. It even converted me to a fan and started reading the manga because of it!!! Having read the manga, I realise that it gets better from here!!! I am expecting more for the rest of Season 2 and seriously can't wait for the day where the hype for this show gets even bigger!
Since I was really long-winded, here are some good & bad points for this show. Basically, this show is for all the impatient people out there who dislike slow pacing and would like to enjoy a decent show (although it is a really awesome show for me). 
GOOD:
-Great pacing
-Moderate development for each episode
-Intense fight scenes

Rounded to a solid 7.
Personally, I feel like I enjoyed this show quite much, at first it was slow, getting to know Deku, It was like knowing myself in a way.
I am not going to speak much on this anime, other than some scores on how I rate the actual anime lol
Beginning was well, like any other anime, rough, getting to know the characters and such, Deku being a crybaby same as Takemitchy in Tokyo Revengers, well similar spirit, similar vibes i guess?
I don't like Bakugou's character, well, not 'really' don't like, I don't hate em, but he is just too arrogant, unable
                  to accept that Deku has a Quirk, and always wants to be #1, I mean sure, a lot of people want for that, but what is the sense of Bakugou hating on Midoriya just because he's nice? (I guess that's the flow of his character I suppose..don't blame him sometimes tho, his combat ability is good)
The end we see that the students get mixed up in something, I like how the students helped out a lot in that situation.
The only thing negative about this show is... the character development.....? Well no, It ain't negative but it sure did get improved a bit in S2. Sure you have Deku, working his ass off to be strong to hold One For All... but he's still a crybaby , like most Shounen protagonists lol, we have Bakugou who's a dick, Uraraka as a very helpful and sympathetic girl, and Iida as a top of the class, guy who wants everyone to be doing well (a very good character though.)
During the backstories for Deku, why he doesn't have a Quirk, is well, good! This show would be worse if EVERYONE would have a Quirk meanwhile only about 70-80% of the population have it. He never gave up, or atleast tried to... atleast.
He proved that someone like him can be a true hero and that's what I came to say!

                The beginning of My Hero Academia is basically a lesson in how to start a story. A battle shounen with several common elements. Wow, Heroes. Wow. Well, MHA could be the worst shounen ever created. But NO. Not even close. The beginning is a masterpiece. You watch the first episode and it hooks you. You want to see more. A 20 minute episode that has such an emotional charge. Wow, what a way to begin. Completely nice at all. The pacing is fair enough too. When you see how long does Midoriya have to evolve and how long Midoriya in fact evolves you realise that
                  is a fair pacing. Although, the pacing can't go wrong in most of animes. The writing characters is ordinary. By far, the best character in this season is All Might. I don't even need to say why. The animation could be better. It is good but, eeeeeh, not enough, could hit more the spot to be honest. But, it is good as a whole. The design is excellent. Traits that does not bother you in mostly cases and in fact have a visual identity. Really nice, that really hit the spot. The character development is fine. Once we're in first season of a several seasons anime, we can't charge that much on this issue at this point, at least for now. But, bro. The fights. The fights are insane. The OST fits PERFECTLY with the moment. Deus ex machina? Maybe. But it doesn't stop being insane. Just watch it.

                My Hero Academia was the 3rd Anime I ever watched, and so I think it will always hold a special place in my heart. But I think there was more that drew me toward the anime in total, things like the character development, in which I really enjoyed.
 I also really love the way that the show is paced, and I would even say that it has my favorite pacing out of any other anime I've watched. The characters I was the most drawn toward, were Shoto Todoroki, Tamaki Amajiki, and Denki Kaminari.
 Now the reason I was drawn toward Shoto was due to his
                  amount of character growth starting from the 2nd season and even till right now during his Dabi fight in the manga.
 Now Tamaki Amajiki is a character that isn't shown as often as the others, but I love the way he views himself as being the suneater, because Mirio said he shines brighter than the sun, and how he always looks up to Mirio, as if he's the only star left in the sky.
 But overall this show is fantastic especially for beginners, and for those who enjoy the show, don't be discouraged by the haters, or pushed away by the odd things the fandom sometimes does. Find a way to enjoy the show, without looking for others opinions.",10,LynnMarie7686

                É nessa primeira temporada em que conseguimos completar a mais pura essência do que é o anime boku no hero, nela nós vemos lutas empolgantes, intrigas entre rivais, e  como romances e comédia.
O anime enquanto só nisso, sabe balancear isso bem para produzir as emoções certas nas horas certas, ou melhor, nas horas necessárias.
Para mim, o mais interessante ao assistir BNH é o clímax heroico que permeia a obra, a sensação de salvação vindoura de um único sorriso, as mensagens que transcendem a tela e levam ao coração e corpo do telespectador uma sensação de êxtase, um saber de que há alguém naquela situação
                  que se sacrificará para manter a paz.
Claro, o anime não deve abusar desta fórmula, por que se não ele irá de emocionante para repetitivo, e isso iria significar sua morte para mim.
Dou nota de 8.0, é bom, não excede nada de extraordinário, faz um bom uso da fórmula do shounen para produzir cenas que fazem arrepiar, ou seja, cumpre seu papel.",7,Btelgueuse

                After Death Note, this is the first anime I have binge-watched in a very short period of time. My Hero Academia season 1 surpassed my expectations from the first episode itself, with a protagonist whose grounded characterization (overthinking, talking to himself, craziness for superheroes and even shyness around girls) resonated with me so much I felt I was him. Watching this season brought back so many childhood memories of playing with action figures and aspiring to be a hero despite having no powers.
I am not a critical viewer anyways so enjoying it was very easy for me. Within the first four episodes itself, I found
                  the motivation to workout and pay attention to fitness (inspired by which I got myself a pair of hand grips like Deku, the protagonist). I could say this anime pretty much saved my life from further depression and gave me hope: that anime is still going strong when compared to live-action counterparts. This particular season has the least number of episodes compared to the rest other seasons, but being an origin story, it gives a lot of exciting action sequences, comedy and motivating upbeat moments. 
But guess what made this even more of a masterpiece? The characterizations. We get to see the heroes, their impressive quirks and how they bond with each other. Protagonist Deku and his childhood friend Katsuki's complex relationship is very well etched. How Deku still sees him as an inspiration in spite of being bullied over and over shows some humans are just pure and devoid of pure hatred. The animation does justice to it, and I am truly impressed by how gold this Bones studio product is, especially during the fight sequences, which are a sight to behold. The opening and closing tracks are brilliant as well. 
One of the biggest plus points is the lighthearted tone and adequate pacing due to which it becomes addictive and hard not to binge in a sitting. I credit My Hero Academia, this season in particular, with returning me to the process of binge watching anime shows which I personally was unable to do after a personal incident. This anime left me VERY happy, and made me want to be a ""shounen"" all over again and cherish the school life with my friends. If an anime can give a viewer positive messages to follow in reality, it definitely is a masterpiece. And isn't that what entertainment is for? This season is a gem, and one of the greatest origin stories of all time, in my honest opinion. Most of all, it made me smile and motivated me to become a hero in reality. Glad I saw this.",10,PrashastSingh

                watched after many years of bullying from my friends. I gave it a genuine chance I really did but it's just another boring long-form action anime replace quirks with chakra and you got naruto and if naruto and superheroes are your thing you'll definitely enjoy it but if you want something with a little originality or substance, give it a miss because by episode 7 you'll become super bored. there is quite literally nothing special here characters are basic run of the mill shonen characters, the story and plots took place in other series in one-way shape or form and added together they make something
                  that definitely has a market and there's is a good reason it's popular but if you want something that isn't just a superhero flick it's not gonna be your cup of tea

                If you think that there will never be a series like Naruto or One Piece, well guess again. The first season of My Hero Academia has ALL of the good traits of a Shonen series and none if not, few the bad ones. The show's animation and the fact that it's centered around Superheroes, satisfies not only the anime fan in me but also the comic book fan in me. In this show's short first season, we've been introduced to so many characters, it amazed me how much thought and detail that was put in each and every one of them. 
My only complaints are:
-It's
                  too short and I think it's because people didn't have much faith in it
-The only female main character is suffering from the ""Sakura effect""

                I've decided to watch the anime after seeing many characters around the internet and finally finished the first season. The story is not that surprising, quite simple to be honest, but the characters are very instigating and this is what made me watch the 13 episodes. However the main character, at least in this first season, isn't that good for me. The personality is quite basic and boring if we compare to the other amount of heroes.
10 for the track, it goes really well with everything that is happening during the episodes, a nice match.
This first season it's quite enjoyable when you don't have anything
                  else to watch, and I'll definitly give a try for the next seasons mainly because I want to see the development of some characters and powers. In overall everything goes well and it's good so, I'll give it a 7. :)",7,Ethwal

[SLIGHT SPOILERS]
For the first three episodes, the pacing was slow and I felt bored. The main character, Midoriya Izuku, wasn't even that compelling. He was introverted, determined, and bullied by everyone in his life. He's a great character for relatability, but a bad character interesting-wise. It doesn't help that the ""shy, but determined"" trope has been done multiple times that it has become a cliché. 
Izuku also didn't deserve the power. The reason behind it was silly. Izuku had caused more trouble than good, but All Might decided to give him power because Izuku was brave and he ""didn't think,"" i.e. he charged in trying
                  to save somebody without any hesitation, and that's heroic and brave.
Wouldn't have been heroic and brave if he had caused a causality, but all right. 
Onto the worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is weaker than Izuku's character. Something magically happened, and now people have super powers. The show doesn't explain how or what, it just says. I had my brain mostly turned off to enjoy, but this glaring point slapped me in the face harder than my Mom. This tiny aspect made the show weak.
The other characters are archetypes, and none of them are particularly interesting. They aren't fleshed out as much because the show mainly focuses on Izuku, and the people close to him. Even the people close to him aren't fleshed out; they are still bound by tropes. 
For the emotional part of the story, it wasn't strong at all. This was a given since the characters themselves barely have depth. The emotional aspect was just Izuku screaming and shedding an abundant amount of tears that is inhuman. Crying is his real Quirk. Good lord, his tear ducts are the size of King Kong's balls. When he cries, it's like the Niagara Falls. Oh, and when he screams, ooh boy. I had it on a volume of 10 on my computer, and you can still hear his screams within a five-foot radius. This makes me take the scene in a non-serious way. The ""emotional"" scenes clash with the light-hearted scenes; the light-hearted scenes are what make up the majority of the show. 
I'm ambivalent on whether I would recommend this. I'd recommend it hesitantly, and warn that person that the show is full of tropes, and that the first three/four episodes are sluggish, but if you turn of your brain and ignore most of the detriments, your enjoyment of the show should be fine.

                Ugh, I promised myself I wouldn't go down this path and actually watching the first four episodes didn't do much for me. However, the show gets much better after he actually enters the school.
The thing I disliked at the beginning was this show felt like it would be too similar to the typical shounen trope - a main guy who's the underdog, his ""rival / best friend"" who's his basic opposite in every way, a girl he's friends with who carries that weird tension between friend / lover, and a teacher who acts lazy but is super skilled when the time requires it. I watched
                  the first four episodes and found it all very typical, but after he actually enters the school, it got much better for me. I love that this show incorporates every student as their own main character. Even though the main star is undeniably Deku, each character has their own personality and back story in a way that really makes them feel that they're heroes in their own way and seeing their relationships grow stronger is really fun to watch. So yes, I've been won over - this show is hilarious and fun and heartwarming and I hate that I've been won over.",9,halimede

                I wouldn't say I liked this first season too much, mainly because the first two episodes were too comic-like, and I found it pretty childish and unappealing.
The premise revolves around a society where everyone has power or quirk, which varied from having long fingers to manipulate their height or form ice.
Society is ruled by heroes who fight to defend citizens from the hands of villains. Kids who want to be heroes could enrol in different schools that will train them to be one if they got accepted into the hero class. The most popular academia is the UA, where most of the more popular and
                  strongest heroes hailed from, one of them being All Might, the biggest inspiration of the main protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, a boy who was born without any single power.
As the season went by, I started to like it. At some point, I thought how so many of the students from class 1A might have been accepted in the hero program; that was the moment I realized I was hooked on the anime.
Overall, at least for me, this season was not the greatest; but it fulfils its purpose of keeping the audience watching. So, I recommend you to give it a try, and the road is going to be a rollercoaster of emotions fueled by wholesome and exciting moments.",7,Hazbyn

                I ve resently seen Boku no hero academia and I want to share my thoughts with the community ! First of all the character is very mainstream , he's nothing special just a kid with dreams of becoming a super hero , but for some reason he cant . However he is lucky enough to see the number one hero from close . Then the number one see's something special in him and helps him to become the number one hero when he himself retires . As you can see the plot is very similar to a lot of other shonen animes . The animation
                  the sounds the characters is good nothing more nothing less . But for some reason I myself found the side characters more intresting than Deku ( the main character ).
Even though i enjoyed the series the main character wasnt something fasinating . I believe that a lot of side characters have a better back story from Deku . My general opinion on the show is positive , but be prepared that you wont see a masterpiece . You will just see a shonen anime without a lot of intense moments and scenes . Of course there is some intense moments but not in every episode . Concluding , it is a good anime and I think new anime watchers will like it more !",7,DennisSXyl

                The thing about this show is that it's got a neat concept (superpowers) with a simple premise (how the MC became the #1 hero). I admire that, while the story is simple, it tells it so compellingly. Elements of world-building, such as how society functions with the majority of people having some sort of superpower, may be unrealistic if scrutinized, but it's certainly within the realm people can reasonably suspend their disbelief to enjoy. What makes this show a standout to me are its characters. It's pretty great how the show spends the time to deepen just about every character in such a way that
                  doesn't drag the story down. The exception is Mineta, but I'll ignore him. The animation stands out when action is happening, which is cool. Overall, very enjoyable.",8,TangyAbleOrange

I went into MHA with Death note level expectations but that's probably my fault anyway MHA is a really good anime it does most areas really well like character development and voice acting.

                I genuinely love this anime so, so much. Regarding shounen anime specifically, it's definitely my favorite. However, I would also like to preface this by saying that I have NOT completed watching the entire four seasons of the anime.
Animation: Great! It was a pleasure to look at and well done, vibrant and I absolutely loved the fight scenes.
Music: The music made me so hype, and conveyed the superhero theme perfectly. Made scenes so much more thrilling, and the opening songs were absolute bangers.
Storyline: Now, it's definitely not anything you haven't heard of before: underdog boy develops superpowers, defeats all kinds of bad guys, makes important
                  friends along the way and learns even more important lessons, all so he can become the best superhero. Childish concept, but I still loved how it was executed. It was almost refreshing, in a way. The genre has a lot of limitations, but MHA embraced them and just ran with it. Excuse my slight tangent but, everyone wants to do something different nowadays, so when I see something like MHA, I actually like it even more than something that tries so hard just to make something ""deep."" It's not necessarily shallow, but it's just lighthearted and fun without worrying too much about making something revolutionary, because it doesn't have to be.
Characters: I hear a lot of people talk about how much they hate the main character, Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya because of how whiny he is, but personally, I quite liked him, despite his slight lack of a fully faceted personality. While he is definitely whiny, I (personally) think a lot of what is being said about him is exaggerated. Still, that being said, if you really can't stand whiny characters, I don't suggest watching this anime, because you'll probably dislike him.
Besides Izuku, the other characters' personalities are nothing unheard of either, but done well. Their backstories are pleasing without being convoluted, and the characters all have good chemistry when talking to one another, and seem to have nice, genuine relationships (excluding Midoriya and Bakugo, of course). There are too many characters for me to pick apart everyone, but in general terms, I find every character to be likeable in their own, unique way. Plus, they (usually) seem to fully realize the gravity of their actions and fights and are very self-aware most times, which I found to be very refreshing.
Overall? I would say, from a less biased standpoint, 7/10. The anime knows its limitations, takes them and turns it into a comprehensive, easy-to-digest and fun story with good action scenes and great characters. A textbook shounen anime done very well.
From a much more biased, opinionated standpoint, 10/10. There's something about MHA that I just can't get enough of. I've tried watching other animes here in there in varying genres, but I just keep coming back to it. I can't help it, I've become so attached to these characters that nothing else satisfies my love for shounen anime quite like this one.",7,monarchzy

                Caveat up front: I really, really love superheroes.
Comic books are one of my favorite things.  I have a Batman tattoo.  This is the kind of stuff that I live for.  So when I heard that there was a popular superhero-themed shonen anime, combining two of my favorite mediums and genres?  Suffice to say I was excited - especially when people seem to talk about My Hero as being, at least popularity wise, on the level of the Big Three of old that were my go-tos during my younger and teenage years.
In my opinion, BNHA, My Hero, whatever you want to call
                  it, does live up to the hype.  Is season one a revolutionary piece of anime?  No.  It's a shonen fight anime.  If you don't like shonen fighting anime, you're probably not going to see a ton here that's going to completely sway you, as Horikoshi is definitely not out to reinvent the wheel, especially in these early episodes.
But if you like shonen battle manga and the like, then this should absolutely scratch your itch.  The story is fairly simple stuff - the underdog lacking some key power who is determined to be a big deal and a hero anyway, a la Naruto.  Except, frankly, Deku is a far more likable lead than Naruto ever was.  Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of the shouty hothead leads - I much prefer a slightly more sensible Ichigo, Maka Albarn, Ed Elric type in my shonen - but Deku is charmingly real, a shonen hero for the slightly more anxious and insecure 2010s.  The cast is rounded out with strong players, from one of the best mentor characters in recent years in All Might, a very likeable and charming ""main girl"" in Uraraka, and a host of wacky and entertaining side characters like Tokoyami, the fan favorite Asui, and all the rest.
One thing BNHA really has going for it, too, compared to the shonen heavy hitters of old, is extreme quality animation and art right out of the gate.  Bleach and Naruto had a charming late-90s/early-00s roughness to them from the start, but the animation was at times stiff and a little cheap, and things were only worse for One Piece or Fairy Tail coming out of the gate.  MHA has no such problems.  Everything is glossy and gorgeous, with well realized characters and beautiful action scenes.  It's visually impressive and just grabs you, and the score is fittingly energetic and vibrant to go along with it.
There's not a lot to dock it on, really.  The worst is mostly just that, especially in season one, the plot is a bit paint by numbers, and the villains not too terribly engaging - Shigaraki is detestable but fairly one-note at this point, Nomu literally mindless, and there's not a ton more to go off of - and, well, a big deal breaker is going to be how you feel about series rival Katsuki Bakugo.  Some people love him, some people hate him.  Personally, I've rarely wanted to slap a shonen rival more, and other than late series Sasuke Uchiha, I can think of few who are more insufferable on the verge of psychotic, but we're already seeing shreds of development even this early on that will, slowly, steer him away.
Again, the question is simple.  Do you like big, bombastic, fight-filled shonen?  Then you're going to enjoy MHA.  It's not reinventing the wheel, but it is a beautiful, well-put-together repackaging of the classics, and everything feels unique enough to never really feel like pastiche or rip-off of anyone in particular.  And if not, well, you might find it charming enough to carry you through anyway.  There's certainly plenty worse.",8,jokerdesilva

                There's a heart to this show.
Right of the beat, you get a see a 15 year old kid getting bullied by his friends/classmates, crushed by reality that he can't become or achieve his dream and even the one who he admires the most says it's impossible for him. A sad thing to witness but he gets a chance or rather, he earned a chance. He proved that despite all, despite everything he have been through or going through, he still have what it takes to move forward.
One of the massive benefit this show has, is it's melodrama, which actually should've had an opposite effect, cause
                  melodrama is a cheap trick to invoke emotions but the show isn't really hiding tho. You got some generic characters with your usual ""Heros & Villains"" plot, generic world and with probably the most simple & generic powers you can name. Heck! Even Midoriya's ability is nothing but brute strength, something every 10 year old once might have dreamt about and a very outdated super power (though it had it's gimmick). And the show doesn't even try to be anything more than that. But that seemingly predicable drama just worked. I never really thought it was boring or bad, quite enjoyed it actually. It didn't really hyped me up or made me cry, but it did grabbed me and made me sit through all the seemingly childish plotline with it's melodrama. Quite the feat.
Other than that, the only points worth mentioning about this show are; the character designs and music. There's no character who is deep & interesting (since there are all just generic), but everyone have some charm to them. And accompanied music in melodramatic scenes are befitting and sometimes does a surprisingly great job at enhancing it. Other than that, nothing really worth mentioning.
There are many plain to sight plot armor & plot consistencies. The story is about how Deku becomes the world strongest hero, which he literally mentions in episode 2. While I know the show trying to be nothing but generic, saying this kinda took out all the suspense there's to the show, which shouldn't be a bother but it kinda is. Since the show heavily relies on melodrama, it sometimes fell flat. The fights are well animated though not as excellent as I thought or everyone makes them out to be. And while I heard some nasty stuff about the fandom, they didn't really bothered me, cause thankfully. The only one I know is a nice person.
The show only have one thing to say and it only says that one message again and again.
Go Beyond your limits.
Midoriya, All might and even Bakugou to an extent, constantly try to go beyond something big. Something they can't achieve as they are but they will go beyond. Because... It's their dream.

I first watched My Hero Academia a few years ago and I thought it was amazing. Recently I decided to come back to it after experiencing a good number of other anime and while I still enjoyed it the second time around, it is overall not as great as I remember. I will start off by saying that the art and sound are both consistently well done throughout the show. Fight scenes are fluid and action packed, characters each have unique and memorable designs and the op has energetic music and exciting visuals which really set the mood for the
                  show. However, the plot and characters are where the show begins to fall apart. Though neither aspect is straight up bad, the overused character tropes and underdog story both result in an anime which seemingly brings nothing new to the table. The appearance of the ""League of Villains"" later in the story also feels disjointed from the rest of the show and is really just an excuse to have some action before the end of the season. As previously mentioned, I did still enjoy season 1 of My Hero Academia upon my second viewing and I do think it is a good show, however the bland story and characters do heavily detract from an otherwise great production. If you like shounen, action or superhero shows you are likely to enjoy MHA, just know that it is not as great as some people chalk it up to be.

(Story)
The story basically follows a kid nicknamed Deku who is born into a world where people are born with supernatural powers. Not everyone is born with these supernatural powers though. Deku is one of those people. Deku's dream since he was a child was to become a hero even though he was quirkless (never obtained a supernatural power). One day Deku meets his idol All Might, a well known superhero. To cut this description short All Might see's potential in Deku and gives him his power. Deku makes it into the UA, a school who basically trains students to become heros. There he
                  makes friends and careless throws himself into dangers path. Deku still has to be able to control his power and that's what he struggles. I like the story because it's easy to follow and I wasn't really left wondering anything besides how long will it take for Deku to control his power. This is why (in my opinion) I gave the story a 8/10.
(Characters)
I LOVE THE CHARACTERS. Every character has something unique to them and although I don't know much about each character I can tell which characters are the best (in my opinion). My favorite male character is Shoto. His hair, the scar on his eye and his power... I like. His power can be OP in some situations and Shoto doesn't brag which just makes me like his character more. My favorite female character is Momo. She just seems tuff and she is intelligent so what is there not to like about her. This is why (in my opinion) I gave the characters a 8/10.
(Enjoyment)
My friend recommended this years ago and I honestly don't know why I never gave it a try. I really like it so far. I like the story, the art, the opening and ending music. This show honestly isn't bad. I haven't really watched a lot of anime's so I'm not sure if that means much but, yeah. This is why I gave my personal enjoyment a 9/10.",8,mar-senpai

                SPOILER ALERT:
I've heard about how popular this series was, and towards the end of my junior year, I started to watch My Hero Academia, and I don't regret it. I never thought an anime about superheroes would be so intriguing to watch, and yet I can relate to most of the characters in many ways.
The plot may be the beginning of a superhero anime with some similarities to the heroes most of us see in comic books, but to me, it felt so much more than just that. I liked how they combined that genre with the school genre, making the combination balanced in the
                  world of BNHA. The anime starts with the main character working hard to get into the school of his dreams but introduces what we'll expect in this series. Towards the end, it introduced the series of antagonists, showing us that this was only just the beginning of it all. The concept of superpowers known as ""quirks"" was good, but it wasn't balanced as only a few can have them, while a few are born without them, so I had mixed feelings about quirks.
The story starts with the main protagonist, Izuku Midoriya described as different from other people. Once he met his childhood idol and became his pupil, he's finally able to accomplish his beginning dreams. He begins to accept that no matter what happened in the past, he'll eventually be able to succeed. Even though the story may be a generic superhero school anime, there wasn't much to show, but I still liked how it introduced all of the characters and shows how much potential they have, and I found that fascinating. Once the anime introduced the villains, I knew that they would have an actual impact on the story, so I felt like there's going to be more to them in the future.
The characters were the most significant factor that made me love this series, especially the main protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, also known as Deku. Deku was one of the most relatable anime characters I've ever seen. The fact that he was considered different unlike other characters was the one thing I can relate to as I felt like I was like that among the people I knew. Although I didn't like how people hated him just because of his flaws, he's going to go through development in the future, he'll improve. As for the other characters, some were likable, while some were not. Most of the side characters were still being introduced, but the main side characters were likable, and seeing how they will impact Deku's life makes them endearing to watch. 
The animation was honestly pretty good. I like how it showed what everyone's quirks would do and show that it functioned just like we thought.  The fight scene towards the end of the season was the best one so far, and it showed how impactful the character, All Might was to the hero society, and the camera works were incredible. The music was one of the more inspiring and iconic soundtracks I've ever heard. The opening and ending brought on hope and showed us that this was going to be a great series to watch.",8,mythical_k

Ive been watching anime for almost my whole life and when My Hero first came out in 2016 i didnt really think anything of it and thought it looked kind of childish. I watched a trailer for it in 2018 and it was about superheros and villains and i was thinking it
                  was going to be like all the other animes and Marvel/DC movies. I decided to give it a shot in 2019 though and i thought it was really cool!

                I actually really enjoyed this on a rewatch surprisingly enough. There is some cliche writing and ideas and it can be pretty corny, but My Hero can get pretty serious and dark when it wants to and even though it has the corny ""MCU Spider-Man"" feel to it, it doesn't have the absolute horrible dialogue that comes along with it which I both like. I do think Deku is overhated and I think I am really starting to see the vision where it is getting me to like Bakugo a lot. I am also starting to see that Shigaraki is a pretty good character. There
                  are some pretty good characters in this show in general to be honest, and the character designs are awesome. All-Might in the battle at the end was pretty sick as well, always badass of him to go do the Plus Ultra thing. I do find it very interesting, which I just noticed now, that the narration of Deku is a great storytelling method, it definitely seems like he is telling his own kids or something about how he became a hero. Despite what people say, I enjoyed this a lot.",7,SPatano_

                Ok, I've got no idea why I LIKED THAT SO MUCH! I'm not a shounen fan, nor even fight anime fan, I'm not all into super heroe stuff, but this actually got me. Why? Iunno, follow it:
My hero academia is not a serious anime or anything, so don't expect deep storyline and really amazing development, but expect more like a light, funny storyline, type of thing you'd take your little cousin to watch so you both have fun (He will probally love it more than you btw) The characters are really ""wait, i've seen this before!"" nothing too special since it falls in big shounen
                  clichés and tropes in the story. The main concept is interesting, not a really big deal, but nice and you can see it's kind of funny, you'll probally like this anime if you as me don't really expect much from the story itself and it's just looking for some funny thing after watching some really good stuff like Attack on TItan and Hunter x Hunter.",8,Jean_Marcos

                When an anime can move your whole heart and even make you hold back a tear in the first episode, you know its going to be one of the best shows you have seen in a long while.  I've seen so many people say this is a rip off of one punch man but it is definetly not.This show is very heartfelt, and moves you way more than you would ever expect. It has good humor sprinkled through out it. It has some pretty good music ion it and I enjoy the supporting characters. I also feel like the main character is easy to
                  relate to. The animation is a bit of an older style, but I feel like it really just makes it that much better for an action anime. In the Hero aspect of it, our main character has more power than just one powerful punch, unlike One Punch Man. One punch man is a satirical gag action anime, and this is nothing like that. yes it has action but it is hearfelt and is comdic, not a gag. If I had to compare it to an anime, I would say Soul eater or Gurren Lagann because it seems to have the same type of comedy, emotional build, and animation movement style, not to mention action. I dont write very many reviews, but since I see so many people talking trash about this one, I thought I would add a review myself. I finished season 1 in one sitting, it drew me into it just in the first episode. I dont really watch action too much, I like more slice of life, so since this had so much story to it, it was right up my alley. I hope you decide to watch this anime, or have also enjoyed watching it just as I have.",10,JakklL

                I love the quirks in the show. It's not just 'telekinesis' or 'flight'. They have random weird quirks like one of the kids has engines in their legs! That's so unique and original for super powers. Each characters power is ""quirky"" and fun and can be devastating if put into the right circumstances.
I also like the way the show starts as a cute story about a powerless boy gaining powers in a superpowered world but once the story starts moving, we start to really focus on how damaged and awful hero society is. The villains in the show have a point and the heroes aren't
                  always in the right. Even the ones we love the most can be horrible people and it makes them feel more real. it's a really good show!",9,OtakuInku

I used MHA to introduce my superhero loving dad into anime and he liked it and wants to move on to season two. But he's not in a rush to watch it. If he was really into a show he would make an attempt to watch more, and I feel the same
                  way. I don't get this over whelming feeling to continue the series. I would be completely ok with only watching the first season. I almost dropped this show halfway thorough. People hyped this show up a bit to much and I expected more.",6,TallCeleryStick

                As a starter season of whole story* not bad but not good as overrated.
Story is about one person which want to be better super-hero than his idol professional super-hero which is now #1 hero in the anime. Animation not bad but shadow's darknesses are too much. There's no problem but that. If we came sound, (imo) all soundtracks, openings/endings, effects and voice actor are completely perfect. But characters are reflected like they are middle of the between senior year and being professional super-hero. So everything said, do you enjoy this show, especially first season? My answer is yes. Either you started to watch animes at
                  last years or already watched so many years, so many anime, both of you love show. So overall (+/-)
PROS:
• Our boy is very WHINY. You'll understand why & what i mentioned in here if you watch whole season.
• Our #1 Hero AKA All Might is really powerful and has his own limit. 
CONS:
• Season 1 has so many flashback scenes and this is irritated me at almost ending the season.
• Show little bit slower to coming to main story but has its own way while doing this.
• Fans are overrated the whole series. It's good, has 8/10 from me. But not expect anything what they tell you until season 2's second half.
• Also all haters (on crncroll) saying** this show is naruto's bad version, which is both series are shonen and having great fight scenes. But i've to say, BNHA is little bit better than Naruto. This reason hold me from starting the show because im not a big fan of Naruto series. But if you like naruto and not compare these two show, you'll enjoy this show.
* Whole story is telling itself great to you. Keep evolving even first season.
** They are (ig) comparing show, first season to Naruto:Shippuden.
(fyi: Naruto has 6.5/10, Naruto:Shippuden has 7.5/10 from me. Shows are not bad but first show not deserving 7 and second show not deserving an 8 FROM ME)",8,Boraen

                [IMPORTANT]
Treat this as a collective review for all of the seasons (at the time of writing this, 4) of My Hero Academia. I won't go into any of the story details though, however it may contain minor spoilers.
[REVIEW]
I picked MHA out of boredom and because it apparently is quite popular. And after watching it, I know why.
This anime is just another superhero show, like any other. Don't get me wrong, any fans that read this - it still has a uniqe universe, with uniqe characters (as much as they can be) - but it still manages to hit every stereotype and cliche thing you'd expect
                  from an anime like that.
The story is about Izuku ""Deku"" Midoriya - a teenager born in a world, that gives birth to people with superhuman abilities - more or less - wanting to become a hero, just like the current (in the 1st season) top #1 Hero and the greatest of all: All Might.
It turns out however, that our protagonist was born without such powers, names Quirks and his dream is crushed. Or is it? Through a set of events, he finds out that he actually CAN become a hero, even though he is Quirkless and inherits the power of All Might no less, being chosen by him to carry its legacy on and eventually find someone worthy of its power, just like he was chosen. Then, he attends the best school for heroes in the world (or so they say) to train to become the very best, alongside other students.
Deku takes on the difficult role of become the ""next All Might"", trying to control his new power... Which basically sums up the entire anime. 
And that is what I take issue with - the whole thing resolves around every hero (or hero in training) facing more and more bigger threats, at first struggling to defeat them, but in the end coming out victorious, be it because of them, or other heroes coming in to help, while they still learn something new.
Nothing ever changes with this cycle. We, as viewers, always know that the heroes will defeat the new villain no matter what, even if there will be sacrifices made. There's no element of surprise, no tention, because the whole thing repeats itself in every ""Arc"", if we can call them that.
Basically, there's a new ""Arc"" or just a small story every 2 or 3 episodes, with an episode of a break for their school life or other shenanigans. In each of these stories, a new threat appears, that they have to face off against, being met with incredible strength, only to learn a new power to beat them. That's how every single of these stories or ""Arcs"" work.
All of this wouldn't be too bad, if characters were good or interesting at all. But there are almost none.
Deku is the stereotypical ""good guy"", who is supposed to be weak, but has a good heart that let's him push through any obstacle. He is of course also very shy, except for when he has to protect someone. He also manages to change everyone around him for the better and actively tries to. Blushes when he has to talk with a girl. But worst of all, he cries a lot, whether he is sad or extremely happy. For a protagonist to be so bland and uninspired, it makes it hard for me to actually like him.
Other characters fall in line with almost every stereotype you can think of as well - a noisy, asshole-type of a rival for Deku (who is actually one of the character that are even remotely interesting, because he has to go through character development, unlike Deku and almost all of the others), shy and quiet girls, a cutie girl that falls in love with the protagonist, a supporting cast of girls that range from smart through shy to being an idol type, peverts/idiots/your everyday guys on the male side of students, harsh or kind teachers (no joke, there's almost nothing in between there)... Nothing here stands out enough that I could actually praise and name them.
Characters that are actually interesting are the villains - but they last mostly for the whole ""Arc"" or so and even those who stay for longer, don't get enough screen time. The story shifts mostly to the everyday life of Deku and his friends or to their struggle agaisnt a new threat, rather than what the villains actually plan to do. They're only on screen when the plot has to move forward, or a new one has to be created to keep us entertained.
The main plot itself is all over the place, sometimes taking the lead, but most of the time being cast aside for the side plots of the new threats, so we never actually know what the goal of the main antagonist is or may be in the future. Which is a good and a bad thing - good, because we may look forward to a mystery being uncovered, bad because we're not given enough reasons to care about that mystery. Because the events leading to it are redundant and never change their template.
The jokes and overall humour did not click with me either. It's yet another ""hehe boobies"" or exaggerated expressions and emotions, and really anything you could think of about a highschool themed anime.
On the other hand, the art and animation together with the sound is simply amazing. Bones really did a great job of making all of the 4 seasons consistent with quality and I'm happy about that. Actions scenes look great and has memorable OST to go along with them.
To sum it all up - MHA is a... Fine anime. It's nothing special, nothing I'd go back to like One Punch Man, but also nothing so bad that I'd try to nitpick. If you have nothing to watch, especially from the superhero genre but still want to see something amazingly animated, give it a shot. You probably won't be blown away, but it's suitable to kill time and entertain you.",6,polski8bit

                anime with the most epic battle scenes, and lots of emotional scenes, the character design is also unique I like it very much, the story is also very cheerful symbolizing a hero, this anime also teaches us how difficult it is to be a hero, for the main character I think is very much in accordance with his passionate depiction  , overall this anime is mandatory for you to watch, I always watch boku no hero academia until season 4 and the results are satisfying, no matter how good someone's work there are certainly drawbacks, the lack of this anime is an old school

                OK first and foremost. TO HELL WITH WHAT OTHERS WITH A RATING OF 5 OR LOWER. THEY DON*T UNDERSTAND S*** ABOUT ANIME.
OK with that out the way let's get to it.
Background facts: Boku no Hero Academia anime is based off a manga of the same title and is written and illustrated by Horikoshi Kohei, which is published by the iconic Shounen Jump and has over 140 chapters at the this review is written.
Summary(Skip this if you want): The story is set in modern Japan, where humans are able to develop superpowers, called ""Quirks"", which already apparent at the age of 4, and with that, people
                  are able to make use of their superpowers and officially become heroes who fight against villains as a job. In the story we follow a boy named Midoriya Izuku, who has since childhood admired the heroes all around the world, with his biggest hero being one named All Might, which is the strongest and most powerful hero in the world. Midoriya Izuku with dream of one day that he'll too become a hero like All Might, soon discovers that his dream is not obtainable, as he is ""Quirkless"".
One fateful day on his way back to home, Izuku bumps into a powerful villain. The villain instantly captures Izuku, with the intention of having him as a hostage. Being completely helpless, Izuku could do nothing but tear up and hope for a rescue. Seconds later a tall and muscular man appears and knocks the villain away, with the man being All Might himself. During this fateful meeting Izuku leans that the heroic appearance of All Might is just a transformation gained from his Quirk. And that in reality All Might's true form is an extremely thin and small man. He also learns that All Might soon has to retire, as he can't keep up anymore due to an fatal injury from a fight in the past. Before All Might leaves Izuku asks him if it's possible to become a hero despite being ""Quirkless"", with All Might's answer being ""no"".
Later on the same day, the villain from before has appeared again, and has captured a ""FRIEND"" of Izuku, holding him a a hostage. Nearby and closeby heroes gathers in attempt to save the captured ""FRIEND"" with their attempts being in vain, as the villain is stronger than it looks like. Izuku and All might also gather to the place, but both being being unable to do anything, especially All Might having all of his powers used up for the day. As Izuku watches his ""FRIEND"" struggle to come free, he charges straight at the villain in hope that he'll be able to at least do something. As All Might watches the ""Quirkless"" boy charges in to save his ""FRIEND"" he realizes how pathetic he himself has become. Mustering the very last bit of his strength, All Might transforms back and saves the two boys and arrests the villain.
Finally as the day seems to come to an end, Izuku on his way back home gets greeted by All Might saying that he saw Izukus heroic feat and that he has hero potential. All Might then asks Izuku to become his successor by handing over his powers to him.
After that Izuku trains for a few months and enrolls on a Hero Academia.
Character design/development 10/10:  At first glance and without a doubt you can see that both the characters and the setting are inspired from western(american) culture. Futhermore each character has their unique design and personality, where the characters themselves receives great development as seen in season 2 of the anime and in the manga. And to top that off, as this is a power/ability based series, each of the characters also wield unique and cool abilities. Compared to other series where they just fire off one laser/beam attack in different colors and shapes and call that a day (I'm looking at you Fairy Tail >:( ) Bascially without just being Kamehameha and Final Flashes, each of the characters abilities are unique and well implemented.
Animation 8/10: Well... while not everyone can be as awesome as Toei(pffft) Bones Studio definitely did a pretty good job on bringing the mangas features alive. Though there's a few places where you'd notice some sort of slack, especially in the background and in the fights, as the debris from explosions often turn out just to be ""white blocks"" Otherwise I'd sat it's pretty standard for this type of anime.
Sound 10/10: Mmmm nothing much to say about the sounds itself, but a thing I definitely want to point out is the Original Soundtrack. OMG it is amazing especially the track ""You Say Run"" which has pretty much become it's primary fight/hype song. Oh yeah.. And they all composed by the LEGENDARY Yuki Hayashi. Y'kno'? famous for Naruto OST and Fairy Tail OST.
Enjoyment 10/10:The thing about classical Shounen types is, YOU NEED TO THINK OF ANYTHING. I mean what's the point of saying: ""that's unrealistic, things doesn't work like that in real life blah blah blah"" C'MON it's a Shounen for Pete's sake. Most of the time, you're not even here for the plot, heck you're probably here for the awesomeness that is the fights and the hype you get from them. 
But I digress. It has a well balance off comedy, plot and fights. The comedy is light, but still rather enjoyable for both adults and children with it's gigs and gags.
Conclusion 10/10: As with all other traditional and old school Shounen series, the plot is based on a formula, and that being the typical: young boy with the dream to become something big in the future, who, with dealing with hardships and difficulties, slowly becomes stronger and more mature. While this is repetitive and may appear boring, AS MOST OF US GREW UP WATCHING THESE may find that this is just ""another one"" .With that said, it is not necessarily a bad thing, actually I find it refreshing finally to see another one these being animated(not counting DB super and Boruto as their just a continuation). 
And finally, while 12 episodes are nowhere near enough to cover everything the manga has to offer, it's still a pretty good presentation of the manga, now that 2nd season of the anime is out, you could just go and watch that if you felt that season 1 was a bit lack luster, or maybe the manga if you're feeling up for it.
Some final words: I'd say, having watched a lot of cartoons and anime as a child of this genre, it is definitely refreshing to see a modernized take on the classical shounens. Call me childish if you want, but I find it refreshing to see your hero awesomely(is that a word?) bashing on the evil guys face. Brings back childhood memories..",9,Yaenner

                I will keep this simple - MAH is Naruto without ninjas and MAH is Bleach without shinigami.
Basic premise however is the same. MC starts of plain-ish and develops his powers to near OP levels and defeats the main baddie of every arc. Along the way he meets a boatload of side characters who also have powers, some near OP some pitiful. All this while being guided by mentor figures that he will exceed. Naruto has Kakashi & Jiraiya, Ichigo has Urahara & Yoruichi, Deku has All Might & Gran Torino.
Difference being, MAH trades in ninja skills and spirit weapons for actual Marvel / DC inspired
                  superpowers. If you're a fan or Naruto & Bleach, you will most probably going to be a fan of MAH as well. Similar-ish stories with a different setting.",9,Neocyke

                Although the plot follows a Cliche which is found in many different Shounen Manga/Animes, it is true that this show is entertaining, and highly motivating.
My Hero Academia supports Midoriya Izuku as a main character, who attempts to be a hero like his role model All Might. Despite he encountered numerous frustrations and humilliations as he was born as a 'non-quirk', a people without any special abillities, his dedication to become a hero leads him to a happy ending.
This trait is commonly used in a lot of Shounen Manga's main characters: normal, without any special abillities, but who possesses great passion in order to reach his
                  goal. Their extraordinary dedication and hard work turns out to be more powerful than their ordinariness, and finally they meets a moment when they completes their goal. 
The main character Midoriya Izuku is a perfect example of this figure. This plot could be found as boring and dull, due to frequent appearances on various medias, but this is the why animes such as My Hero Academia is so popular. A story of a young boy who faces fallouts but grows up to overcome them is enough to impress the audience. That is the salespoint.
Apart from the main character Midoriya Izuku, some characters such as Bakugou Katsuki, a ""friend"" of Midoriya from the young ages, and Mineta Minoru, a classmate of Midoriya and Bakugou can be a source of criticism. Both Mineta and Bakugou wishes to become a hero, but their behavior does not consider of a true heroic figure.
Bakugou is a bully who can insult and harm others without hesitation. He has bullied Midoriya for being a non-quirk when they were young, and for threatening his position as a top by achieving enormous improvement now. Also, his reason to become a hero is only to be a high taxpayer with a great earning of money. 
Mineta continues to make sexual harassments to his fellow female classmates, and has shown irresponsibility when facing dangers. Disappointingly, people around them do not discipline or criticize despite their actions that are not suitable to be a hero.
To talk about the overall quality of this anime, this show has a pretty good quality of action scenes, thanks to Bones. However, those scenes were slightly unsatisfactory compared to other masterpieces animated by Bones, such as Darker than Black or Fullmetal Alchemist (based on my opinion). The animating in this show was certainly beyond average and well-made, but not enough to be compared with the 'usual' action qualities of Bones. Also, the OST used in the show was great.
This anime is fairly enjoyable, your preference is the only matter.",9,HANARUKA-

                My Hero Academia is a pretty good anime. I personally enjoyed 1st Season even though the ""superhero"" aspect is less appealing to me, and I'm sure other people will enjoy the 1st Season as well.
Story: 7
The story is generic and its other aspects are no different, and while the process is the same, it's pretty enjoyable and is executed pretty well. The pacing is nice but takes a while to get to the good parts and when you do, especially during the climax, it's pretty great.
Art: 8 
Kohei Horikoshi's art is distinctive, stylish and easy to recognize. It looks even more alluring in motion. It
                  does look childish and makes certain characters harder to cope and take seriously or make antagonists less intimidating and threatening, but most of the character designs are pretty unique and interesting and it's a fitting style for the younger audience. 
Sound: 8
The sound effects are decent, some of them are pretty much the same as other existing anime. Yuki Hayashi's music definitely hits and I get goosebumps every time. It's emotional, epic, makes me wanna stand up and do something cool. It's phenomenal. The voice acting is, as always, great. The voice actors/actresses did a great job, especially in the cool, sad, and funny moments. The opening is great at giving goosebumps and the ending was an emotional one. 
Characters: 7
The characters, both have generic and interesting traits, with some being unbearable at first, which is fine. Teenagers IRL are no different and are much worse. But once their fleshed out, they'll start to become less infuriating and become more humane, flawed and tolerable. For now, they're less developed and will show some growth in the 2nd Season. 
Enjoyment: 8
I felt a lot of tingles just from the 1st Season alone. Despite all the shortcomings, I found a lot of amusement from this. The emotional and epic moments gave me goosebumps, made me cry tears of sadness and joy, along with the phenomenal soundtracks, opening and ending. I wouldn't be enjoying it if it's less entertaining and doesn't make your emotions go wild. I loved it.
Overall: 8
This isn't an excellent shonen anime, but it's a pretty good one for teens, people who love emotional and epic moments, people who love superheroes, and people who just wanna be amazed. Some improvements would definitely make things interesting and better.",8,Ignutz

                My Hero Academia is an anime that became very successful not only in Japan, but also in America. 2016 was a good year for super heroes in media in general. I went into MHA with fair expectations, and for the most part they were met. 
MHA is an underdog story about a boy named Izuku in a world where eighty percent of the world's population is filled with superhumans. In this world, powers that humans obtain are called quirks, which Izuku unfortunately was not born with. That is until one day, after attempting to save a classmate from a villain, his heroism is noticed by
                  grand hero All Might. All Might then passes his quirk, ""One for All"" on to Izuku in hopes he can be the next successor, since All Might can only retain his super strength for a short period of time.
Izuku is a main character you want to root for, as are most of the characters in MHA. Some characters do get more screen time than others, such as childhood bully/rival Katsuki and half hot/half cold hero Todoroki. There are other characters involved, but it is still a bit early to fully flesh them out. 
Both the animation and sound design for MHA are good. Studio Bones also worked on Fullmetal Alchemist, which is another great show with amazing animation and sound.
Overall, MHA is a wonderful edition to the Shonen Anime genre. It is clear that with several more seasons for me to catch up on as well as movies, I do look forward to seeing more.
My overall rating of MHA season 1 is an 8/10!",8,GabberReviews

                I first couldn't get what the hype was about this anime. In the beginning mostly because of Bakugo I really got irritated with the anime and everything and everyone felt one dimensional. Like there was a check list of every troupe of characters and that's their one defining characteristic. That still rings true but it works for this anime. Just don't expect too much depth and watch it as a simple fun hero story.
At first I was only gonna give 6 but as the episodes went on I thought ok this is getting better and then I watched the last 4 episodes and oh man
                  those last eps deserve an 8. So my end verdict is 7.
Overall I had a lot of fun watching this anime especially in 2nd half of the season. So if you like superhero stories, give this a chance since the hype is well deserved and I hope the 2nd season will be so much better than this one. Though I still don't like Bakugo that much....",7,SapphiRubyCrys

                This review has no spoilers! Feel free to read whenever! 
Please keep in mind that this is coming from an anime only's perspective. 
For anyone who doesn't want to read all of this, skip to the end!
I feel like a 6 was a perfect fit for this show. It's a bit above average! Although people may find it predictable, predictable does not necessarily mean bad! Here is the breakdown of what I thought of this show!
The story line is pretty straightforwards. A young boy who doesn't have a quirk works hard to be a hero! As I said in the beginning, the plot is predictable,
                  and a school for hero's isn't the most exciting thing. Because of this, I would rate the story a 3/10.
Maybe we didn't start out well with the story, but the art is really pretty! The way the quirks are artistically presented is amazing. Not to mention the fight scene presentation had me on the edge of my seat! Overall, I would give the art/animation an 8/10.
As for the sound, I found it quite average. There was no track that stood out to me at all really. The opening was really good though. Overall, I would give the sound a 5/10. 
There are a lot of characters! Their personalities really distinguish them, kinda like that pervert! Their designs match their quirks very nicely and it is easy to distinguish between everyone, which is surprising considering the amount of characters in the show! I will ive the characters 9/10 because I really don't like how deku keeps crying. 
I found this enjoyable. You knew our main protagonist was going to win all the time, but how and why was a different story. When things go right for the hero's, you can't help but feel happy for them. I'd give the enjoyment a 7/10. 
Overall, I gave the first season of Boku no Hero Academia a 6/10. Even though the story line was basic, it was still an enjoyable watch. I would reccomend this to people who are new to anime or just the shounen genre!",6,wiisportz

                I discovered this anime almost 4 years ago now, roaming the Internet. At the detour of some suggestions, I watched the first episode... to immediately follow with the rest!
The anime is, visually, simply grandiose: the bright colors make it very pop, the contrast between All Might and the rest of the universe is rather interesting, and the animations are very fluid! A successful anime, then, but not that.
It is above all the content and the speech that I liked enormously: we discover a rich universe, promising and lively, in which evolves a character whose difference is a tare. Until then nothing original, but the first
                  episodes are a real introduction that has the merit to show us this protagonist, Izuku, facing a real challenge that he will not be able to meet the simple force of friendship and his will. So when he is given a chance to realize his dream, we exult with him! We encourage him, and we want to see him succeed. His mentor, No. 1 of the Heroes, is not outdone: both charismatic and caricatural, he is funny, strong and endearing, but not infallible, which moreover constitutes a large part of his interest as ""sensei"" of our hero. In the same way, the other characters all have their share of colors and pep’s that bring their most to the developed universe..",10,Heymateur

If I had superpowers (or quirks as they say in this anime) I would want to be in this school/academy. 
Fast paced progressive story. Writer has done well to establish the main plot in the first season itself. There is a sequence of how the story progresses. Almost every episode ends in a cliffhanger. Props to the direction for that.
Incredible character development. One can basically see each of the characters improving as the story progresses. Multiple main characters, Not a single protagonist story. Some characters are designed without keeping their age in mind and there is little creativity in the
                  design of the side villains but the action scenes compensate for that.
Animation is ""Sugoii"". Perfectly timed perfect BGM and OST. OP is also pretty good and the END is not bad. Studio Bones has done an incredible job. 
Ending is a bit rushed and abrupt. It maybe intended as a cliffhanger but still further elaboration is required. 
Overall a very good anime with the ability to make the audience want to indulge into. Aggressive animation and blasting action scenes with out of the box ways to use superpowers really mesmerizes the audience. Must watch.",8,Zettaheisinium

                everybody on twitter and stuff be raging about todoroki or bakugo but i think we're all missing the real hunk of my hero academia...and that's ALL MIGHT. he is actually so sexy its unreal, i hate when a show is so good but i get distracted by a sexy man...another sexy man...i'm sick
in general, i think it's a really fun anime. i've seen a lot of hate saying this anime is childish and i'm like, does every anime really have to be super duper serious? what's so bad about it being a little bit immature? i think it's fine! it's not exactly the best anime
                  in the world but it's genuinely pretty good. the characters are likeable in their own right, even the villains to some extent, and even though the story isn't all there sometimes, it still holds together pretty well.
granted i haven't actually finished it yet because i think i stopped when the school festival started and they were making a band because seriously what the hell was going on in that arc, it was fun but as far as i was aware it wasn't really important, but who knows, it actually could be super crucial to the story. gotta finish this one asap! & i definitely want to read the manga for this series.",8,judithgrimes

                I had recently rewatched this season after watching it back in 2016. This first season of My Hero Academia is short but it introduces the main characters and villains of the series. To me, it felt that the story was kind of dragged out but this season just serves to introduce us to the world, with little emphasis on any long term arc or plot. Hence, the characters and world was not really well developed or explained. Despite this, it was good enough to get me hooked on the series. Since then, I did not watch any episodes of the anime but instead read the
                  manga weekly. The ""final"" but technically first major fight of the series was awesome and I loved the final punch that All Might delivered was the best. All in all, this season did a great job in piquing my interest for this series. The first time I watched this, I started to read the manga. The second time I watched this, well hopefully I can get started on the seasons soon. :D",8,Goldgiratina

                Everything that ""My Hero Academia"" tries to do, he does very well, the anime have a good art, a interessing character development, a simple plot (because it doesn't need a complex plot) but with a great universe. If you want to watch a good anime, watch this. If you want a good shounen (probably the ""next"" One Piece), you MUST watch this.
Also the soundtracks fits perfectly with every scene.
To be honest, I don't like the art, but it's my personal taste.
The first season is and arc about Midoriya and the character discovering his ideal of being a hero. The anime gave me it, and watchthing
                  this every week, make me want to become a hero myself.
The heroic feeling that I wanted to have after watching probably what the author wanted, and he does it so well that I can't say this isn't one of my favorites animes that I ever watched.",10,Cora-senpai

                If your coming from One Punch Man because your on a Superhero high, then you'll be pleased with this series. This anime has a lot to it's name, and it's blatantly obvious why this anime is extremely popular.
The story is strong, but childish (like our main character). The idea of a world full of people with superpowered , designated as ""Quirks"", where superheroes have become the norm in society is extremely intriguing. The premise alone allows for so many things to be done with it, and this anime goes and uses this overarching premise. From the world to it's inhabitants, the story that surround it
                  all is not only interesting, but also entertaining and fun.
The characters are all unique, and there is never a repeating aspect with any of them. They are all entertaining, and their personalities combined with their quirks help boost that aspect. However, this also proves to be a negative aspect of the characters, as they end up feeling bloated, unresonably silly, and extremely flat and one dimentional. Because of this, when the anime isn't trying to be fun and quirky, and is in a sequence where it wants to be serious, the characters end up diluting the seriousness.
The animation and art is extremely reminiscent to sketches and comic books, which is on purpose. This gives it that old Superhero flare that gives this anime it's distinct style. Other than that, the animation is pretty good and average at the same time. The animation is smooth and the characters are well done, but this doesn't really get carried throughout this season as it should. The quality fluctuates at times, but it isn't anything distracting and irritating, and is passable with a good grade.
Overall, this anime is most definitely directed towards those of a younger age (pre-teens and younger specifically. Of course, anyone can enjoy this anime, but some aspects of it isn't for everyone. If your a fan of superheroes and silly comedy, then watch this as I recommend this. If not, then you can still watch this anime regardless and see if you like it or not.",8,sloshforbrains

                I recommend reading the summary of BNHA before reading this review. This will also contain NO spoilers past Ep 1. I've never made a review before so this probably wont be to great!
Also this is just my opinion, if you wish to criticize it please do so respectfully, same goes for the review itself! 
-Pointless intro below, skip this if you want. :)-
I'll be honest, I was really surprised how much I enjoyed BNHA. From the 1st time I had heard of it, I just really didn't like the show. Especially after encountering a particularly annoying fan of it. But one day, for some reason
                  I felt an urge to try the show again, and now I'm here surprised how much I enjoyed the show. But this out the way, here's my review.
-REVIEW-
First I'll go over the Characters. BNHA is full of diverse characters that I personally all found to be very interesting. They're all are different shapes and sizes with unique personalities. I enjoyed finding out more and more about them and seeing them fight. 
The art style of the show is very different compared to most other animes. It has a much more comic book style to it than anime. But, it looks good and stands out. One thing about the art that I find weird is that some of the characters look much more like the comic style than anime, and vice versa. That in particular is the only thing to stand out about it cause it sometimes just looks weird. But in general, it's good.
The story of the anime follows the basic shounen storyline, (MC wants a big goal and it shows how he achieves it, or doesn't). But of course every anime has its own take on it. Season 1s story sets it up quite nice for the future seasons. It's pretty simple and enjoyable.
For my enjoyment of the anime. I was surprised how much I liked it. As for how much I used to hate this show, I can now say I enjoyed my time spent watching it. This show definitely gets a lot of hate (mostly for the fanbase its created). But if you look past that, I personally think it's a nice show and is worth the watch.
Basically it's a silly simple show that doesn't go to deep. It doesn't need to be taken seriously and is a nice casual watch.",7,WardenIsMySenpai

                I first watched this December 2018, (and binge watched all three seasons in a week). So I don't completely remember what happened, though I did search where season 1 left off. And now that it's a year and a half later, I'm not as big of a fan of the series, and have a more unbiased opinion of it.
Story:
Decent storyline, the hair meme was great, it was interesting seeing the protagonist train for his goals, and become stronger, but i really don't remember what happened after he got into the school. The test, and the other test. Who were the main villains of the season?
                  I don't remember. So it clearly wasn't memorable enough. Therefore, 7/10.
Art:
I don't have anything against it, and unless i thought it was particularly stunning, I will only give a 9/10. I think the animation for both normal scenes and fight scenes were pretty good as well.
Sound:
I really enjoyed some of the OST. Not sure if they were entirely first season OST, but the main theme, You Say Run, et cetera were very nice songs. Kudos to the composer. The opening song is very memorable, and the ending song reminds me of running, which is cool. Voice actors were amazing, there were quite a few well-known voice actors, and I think they portrayed the characters quite well. 10/10.
Character:
Some of the characters are kind of boring, or annoying, or seemed too one-dimensional. It was only 13 episodes of one season of an anime with many seasons, but hey, it could be better. Other series have raised my standards significantly. 6/10. Sorry.
Enjoyment:
I absolutely loved the series when it first came out, enough to watch all three seasons in a week, but now I don't think I could watch this as easily as I watched other series. It wouldn't necessarily capture my attention that well. 7/10, I wouldn't drop the series that easily. Still, not an absolute masterpiece.
Overall: 7.8/10, so I guess I'll be nice and round it up. 8/10.",8,-AC9123

MHA is a great show from its unique powers to its amazing soundtrack. MHA is a very easy show to pick up because the story is very easy to follow and the characters are all rememberable. From the beginning of the show you are thrown into this world superheroes and super villains. No matter how you decide to watch MHA either in sub or dub the experience will still be amazing.

                After watching it 3 times,i can't say anything bad about it.
The first season of the series tell us about the superhuman society and how the life of the MC goes.The person with the most courage to act when no one more tries,it what gives him the right to be called a hero.
He works really high to reach a dream that everyone once said it's impossible,he got the recognition of the most powerfull hero and worked even hard to  not to disappoint him.
The characters are pretty interesting in their own ways,with their unique personalities and power(i have a some favorites).You wil be able to see
                  them get stronger each episode and even with the anime centered in the MC,you'll be able to watch them grown as a person and work to reach their dreams.
There's still some stuff i just don't understand yet(like how some characters passed the admission exam?),but i can say for sure i'll watch it again some day.
Well you can it's a generic anime,cause it is,there's the same vibe like  a lot of others shounen,but once you get to know it better ,you'll for sure get hooked.",10,OmegaJoestar

                This may have a generic setup, but I'm driven by character work and how something makes me feel, and this show excels at both. There's a huge variety of quirks/powers and none truly feel overpowered. The characters are varied, well-made, and grow together (even if one feels out of place and annoying as the perv).
I'm kind of throwing my feelings for seasons 2 and 3 into this as well, but this is the first shonen I've enjoyed this much since watching Dragon Ball Z as a kid. It may not be the most original show, but it's executed well and manages to feel special.

                Strength isn't the only thing that forms a Hero.
In this series, you follow Izuku Midoriya (Deku). A young boy who follows all superheroes, their abilities, their acts of heroism and so on. Midoriya has wanted to become a hero all his life, despite the fact that he has no superpowers. One day he has given the opportunity to prove himself and practice to be a hero, a real hero. And then the story begins.
In general, I liked main characters, the story and whole concept of series. The scenario is pretty good and I could see general experience gaining and individual character growth. There are many
                  characters who have their own story in the background and go very well with the big story at the same time. I love the way characters interact with each other and continue to build main story. I mean, everything has some meaning.
If we're talking about characters, I must mention Bucugo. He's a little weird, even a little crazy, but he's very interesting, and he complements other characters very well.
Although the words ""One for all, all for one"" are often mentioned in the series, it is certainly not the story about ""Three Musketeers"". In this series, everything seems to be based on the fact that one can do everything (All Might), but a lot of times you can confirm that one person can't do everything alone.
This show is really great. I really recommend watching it. You won't regret it! I'll leave another little sentence here - with great power comes great responsibility.",8,Rupucii

                Short Review:
The only thing this anime is lacking is a little more fan service. There are also some episodes that part of the episode is behind the credits causing you to miss part of the story if you aren't paying attention to the remaining length of the episode.
The story is great and is more than the normal ""my friends are my strength"" plot... there is actual real morals behind it. It is also packed with action, even during the usually boring character growth ""training/sports festival"" episodes. The characters are well thought out and designed very well, almost all the girls have their own charm and
                  sexiness... even with the lack of fan service.
Even the strongest of men will have a tear trying to sneak out multiples times through out this season.
Longer Review:
Honestly at this point the credits should just be removed..... it is extremely annoying to be a few episodes in and be lost because you missed something important hidden behind the credits - and since this is my 3rd or 4th time watching this I can't be bothered to try and find all the after credit scenes that I missed. Anyone that actually cares about the credits is usually going to be a fan of a particular voice actor/actress and will recognize them from their voice anyone.... also people can just look up who worked on an anime on sites like this and fan wikis.
The writing is very good and is good about showing the difference between how adults and politics can get in the way and also be important when the values behind these decisions are upheld and how they can create even more chaos when those values are forgotten. (something many countries around the world are experiencing at this very moment - and will sadly likely lead to billions of deaths this time around)
It also highlights how the main character can take something said to him to help him improve himself and/or stay out of trouble and use it to justify getting himself in trouble again.
This is an anime you should probably watch twice... the first time I would recommend just allowing yourself to enjoy it with out thinking too much about things. But the second time I would recommend paying closer attention to what is happening and why, there is deep meaning hidden behind the writing of this first season and hopefully behind the rest of the seasons as well.",10,TeiseiKun

                Story zero-to-hero anime Izuku which delivered this looks very doubtful. He intended to make the audience feel touched, but it is hard to believe that the journey from the very bottom up to the highest peak is really going on. One reason is because the first incident that started the trip, the time when Izuku demonstrating the courage to help others so that then convince the All Might to give Kosei, feels very forced. How could this anime hope to convince the audience that Izuku run from within a hundred meters, past the Hero that is fighting, and immediately hit Villain raging - everything was
                  just on instinct? Yes, Izuku did show courage, but the situation was not the right situation and it makes sense to push one's courage comes naturally. He should not have done what he did, then the All Might not supposed to be touched by his actions, and any Izuku story should never have happened. Another reason is because of the knowledge Izuku in developing strategies when fighting is often greatly exaggerated. The anime is intended to suggest that despite having Kosei, Izuku still struggling with his own business, but where in fact all that knowledge come from? Only by observing the Hero and make notes about them? Might have been different if Izuku have much experience fighting so that he will have the perspective of a fighter, but what can be learned of a child who just admire the hero, especially when the Hero is also basically just always fight using Kosei them and not with the fighting techniques of certain ? Rather than fighting itself, it is more likely to appear Izuku always 'assisted' by this anime, and no touching of the story of someone who won simply because getting 'help'",8,Fueeru

                My thoughts hearing about MHA: I was quite happy to hear that there was a shounen anime where the protagonist was sensitive and soft, which made me think ""oh wow, I could maybe, finally relate to an anime character!""
That, and how my ex had told me that it was a very cool and motivating. 
So obviously I watched it. I was hyped and curious.
Yeah, already just at the first episode, looking at the relationship between Bakugou and Deku, the way they portray Deku's reactions as a bullying victim to Bakugou, just annoyed me. Deku isn't ""kind and sensitive"". He's a doormat. And that's when I
                  understood that one of the biggest things in this anime would definitely annoy me all the way through.
Nonetheless, the concept made me curious. ""A superhero story about a kid who has no powers? That sounds cool. Maybe it'll be a batman-like story, right?""
Oh, wait, no. He gets given powers.
""Oh well, maybe it'll go like Captain America, yeah? That's cool- oh wait no he goes to school and it really is just another shounen anime.""
I still managed to get through the two first seasons despite my disappointment.
I do like some things about it. I enjoy the concept of a bullied kid without powers being noticed by his idol for his courage and given powers.
I also REALLY love Deku's relationship with Uraraka. It's one of the best things I've ever seen in anime honestly. Uraraka isn't annoying, bratty or violent. She's really loveable and cute, and I love how she helps Deku gain some confidence.
I also do like Bakugou's relationship with Kirishima. They have a fun bond that really does help me tolerate Bakugou a bit more whenever the other is on screen.
I also love the animation. While it does dip once in a while when it switches to ""funny mode"", it really does shine when it gets to fight scenes (although animation in anime is the least of my concerns, poor workers get abused enough, they don't need me complaining more about their underpaid overworked shit)
Overall, yeah, it's a very average anime. I can see why people enjoy it, but personally I just couldn't get over all its flaws.",6,Roo-roo

                ok let's just get right in to It The Show Is a Solid 7/10 It's something that Isn't to hard to Understand.The Show Is basic and can be shown to whoever wants to start watching Anime It's a good starting Point for anime Recommendations.It's Art Is some of the most acceptable since people like judging Anime from It's art style.It's Sound Quality Is Really Good.DO NOT expect Characters to have any deep or extremely tragic the closest sad backstory would probably be Todoroki.The Main Character Is Really Boring the side characters are much more Interesting than him.My Enjoyment was a good 7 It was really
                  just basic but really Fun to watch the colors were really good they were pretty.Overall the show Is Good mainly because It's so easy to watch there Is really no Character Development.",7,Weebsrok32

                I've seen all the seasons and the show is bad and every one has there own taste in things but I don't like the show at all the same things happen all the time the fights a bad the bad guys in the show and the characters are good but the whole show dose not make me happy I think KILL LA KILL is a much better show to watch like this or demon slayer the fights are a lot better and season five is the worst one of them all I am on ep nine so I haven't seen all of season five i
                  know a lot of people love this show like ma sister dose but every one has there own taste and how they like things I'm not here to shit on any one or take the fun out of the show.           if my spelling or wording is bad my apologies",6,i_am_bord

                At first, this series is just the typical shounen anime. It's original and all, but it will not be anything but a dhounen anime. That's not bad, specially if you like shounen, like me. Characters aren't the best thing in this anime, because you will hate, or love the protegonist, but you can't get in mid. Secondary characters are good, but they don't get a lot of spotlight in this season. The art and animation is good overall, but it's not the best. The OST is great, Yuki Hayashi is a great composer. The story in general is good, the world is greatly created and
                  very original, with a lot of realism.",7,ruferson

                Was not bad at all. The different types of quirks in the show are super cool. The main character is certainly the underdog, which I love to root for. He seemed like a down to earth and kind young man. He was a character that I knew that I was going to like. The plot was interesting enough and the execution of it was pretty good. I would not really see that much that would set it apart from other series but certainly was a solid first season to the show.
I do recommend that people at least give this show a chance before judging it
                  based on the hype that it gets. You never know what you may like. 
Just a warning, I did not end up watching the other seasons of this show.",7,shineforbangtan
