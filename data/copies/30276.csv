                Going back to One Punch Man, I really thought of something. Something that can make or break this show to several of its viewers. And that's the joke. The one prominent singular joke. 
I'm not saying this is going to be a completely balanced review. And most of you might get upset over that fact, and even start to hate me for it too. And I can understand why. I would hate it if someone didn't provide both sides to the argument for my favorite show, but keep in mind that I am not authoritative force, and I cannot dictate how or what you should
                  think. For all you know, you might just stumble a 4 paragraph post by me describing how shoving hotdogs up your ass is actually a good thing. But I'm hoping that maybe next time you go to the grill, you can ponder on what you're going to do with that hotdog. Or maybe you still won't do that, but you'll at least know why some people might like sticking hotdogs up their ass. But anyways, let's get on with this review.
One Punch Man has got to be one of the most commonly talked about show I've seen this year, even impacting the smash community when one of the smash player's shaved their beard and started using Ryu. In all honesty, how many shows can you say do that? But does this fulfill the hype, and is this the savior of anime?
If you are like me, and expected One Punch Man to be a satire, then you will be disappointed. Rather than making fun of its tropes directly, One Punch Man parodies it instead by over-exaggerating them to the point where it becomes funny. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but there are problems with that. With the already ridiculous start of the series, it makes it hard to enjoy the jokes when they are virtually indistinguishable. You can't top off something so exaggerated, similar to how you can't top off beating an enemy with a single punch. Because of this, as the series went on, the joke lost its charm as it wasn't special anymore. After seeing a couple of episodes, you know what to expect from it, which really damaged the comedy effect. And yes, the final episodes did stray away from that, but even that was just a elongated scene of what was soon going to happen. If you really look at it, it was just Saitama getting beaten up with a variety of attacks.
The problem of One Punch Man getting repetitive may seem like a small thing, but in fact, it really isn't. When a comedy starts to get unappealing, there isn't much that can save that. The parody is all that One Punch Man seemed to offer, and if you don't like that, than you definitely won't like the show. 
Near the end, it was hinted that the focus will eventually shift from the parody aspect to the side characters, something that would benefit the series as the more ""Slice of Life"" aspects where the strong suit of One Punch Man, but for now, the first season is all we got.
You could say that being repetitive and anticlimactic is the point of One Punch Man, and it in itself is actually also parodying the repetitive nature of most action shows, but I disagree. There should be something that would want to make the watcher come back for more. Your daily life as a human being isn't characterized by the same exact thing each time. Maybe the steps building up to 'the punchline' are different, or maybe you don't  exactly engage with 'the punchline' each time. The moment in this case is the same exact thing, with the only differences being how the villains look or where the fight is taking place. What kind of show is engaging, but doesn't have an engaging story? Even if that was the point, how is it fun to watch the same thing 12 times?
If you enjoyed the parody aspect of it, then the repetitiveness of the joke shouldn't be a problem for you, but if you wanted a bit more than just that, then you won't be getting that from One Punch Man.
If anyone tells you that the animation of One Punch Man is bad, then they're just trying to shit on the show for the sake of shitting on the show. Though inconsistent at times, the show looked amazing when it called for a fight scene, and average at least when it called for a more Slice of Life moment.
The music did a good job in making you hyped and excited for each fight and episodes. It's not something I could see anyone listening outside from this anime, but it's good nevertheless in enhancing the show.
There isn't much to say in such a simple show like this. I'll ask once again if it wasn't clear the first 100 times. Did you like the joke, or did you not? After you found that out, you'll know what to do.",5,Taz_

                This is a complete review after watching all 12 episodes of One Punch Man.
**CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS**
I remember when I was 8 years old, I used to be excited for a new Pokemon episode everyday. I used to run from school to my house so that I wouldn’t miss any single moment. Then as you grow up, such excitement starts to fade away. No matter how good a show is, only a few shows can generate such an excitement for a viewer. I never would’ve imagined that an anime would make me feel that excitement again at 20 yrs. And lucky for me, it aired on
                  Sundays!
Story: 7/10
One Punch Man’s story is simple- The story of an average guy who’s a hero for fun. Now what makes this unique is that this show is a parody. For people new to that genre, it’s an imitation of other work. Basically what this anime does is it makes a parody out of shounen genre, where you have a male protagonist who gets beaten down, and then trains or in some other way defeats the bad guy. Here, the MC is just over-powered to the extent that he gets depressed there’s no one strong enough to challenge him. You might think that such a strong person would be revered as a God by the people. Sadly, you’re mistaken. The people don’t even know he exists!! . This really plays a major point in the later episodes, when Saitama has to show his strength infront of the public, and becomes one of the highlight of this series. This show was created to poke fun at all tropes in anime. This is a story made to enjoy, not to be taken seriously. Anyone who is open-minded will enjoy this anime to its full extent.
Art: 9/10
Now the only reason I gave this a 9 is because of the meticulously high standard set by Ufotable in the Fate series and Kara no Kyoukai movies. But by no means is it far behind. In most anime, usually the MC has some kind of weapon, you can just add some flashy effects to go with it. But here, we have a hero who’s weapon are just his fists . The fights had to be carefully drawn and animated. And when you have a studio like Madhouse doing it, you know they rarely disappoint. Fluid motion, spectacular effects, no weird faces, nothing overdramatic. Simple, yet awesome. The best part of this anime has to be the “Saitama Expressions”. If you didn’t smile atleast a little when you saw the “OK” face, then I guess your sense of humour is locked up somewhere. Madhouse know how to make the viewer enjoy the anime to the full extent. The way they used Tatsumaki’s “chibi mode” expressions from the webcomic, and boldly animated it in the anime deserves separate praise. Also the landscape for OPM universe is also brilliant. Even the ordinary people are drawn with careful details. Another important aspect here is the design for the villains, especially Sea King and Boros, each having something unique, and they give out the “strong, badass” vibe when you just look at them.  Also, the art in the final episode is 11/10.
Sound: 10/10
God-level. Simply eargasmic. When you have an opening theme that makes you want to shout “ONE PUUUUUUUNCH!” every time you hear it, you know the soundtrack’s gonna be amazing. For me, the first thing I’d hear in my mind every morning when I wake up is someone shouting “ONE PUUUUUUNCH!” That’s how much I love that opening theme. From character bgm’s to fight themes, the music suits every situation perfectly, making them more epic. I would rewatch every episode again just to hear the music, that’s how good it is. The voice acting is also brilliant, especially Aoi Yuuki, who brilliantly brought out Tatsumaki’s bratty voice, and Yuki Kaji, whose voice fits Sonic’s character perfectly.
Character: 10/10
Once in a lifetime you watch shows where every character in it makes an impact. One Punch Man is mine. I can probably name every single character that appeared in these 12 episodes. That’s how much of an impact they make. Saitama with his care-free attitude, the loyal cyborg Genos, Jack’o Lantern Panic, Brattymaki, Justice Rider, the S-class heroes like Silver Fang, Metal Bat, Pri-Pri Prisoner, King, and all the others have a uniqueness that makes you remember them. Even characters whom play a cameo like Carnage Kabuto, Mosquito Girl, Snek, Stinger, Amai Mask manage to leave an impression, which is something most anime fail to do. And when you have such a strong character cast, the anime rarely falters.
Enjoyment: 10/10
This anime was made to enjoy, and One Punch Man nails the formula. I enjoyed every second of it. 24x12 minutes of pure awesomeness. It makes you laugh, the “wow” feeling when you watch those spectacularly animated fight scenes, even the simple dialogues between the characters make you laugh hard. There is no walking in on naked girl scenes, boob-grabbing, fan service and other shit like that. This anime makes me remember that Charlie Chaplin didn’t have to talk to make people laugh and enjoy his movies. Just his reactions and expressions were enough. And Saitama’s expressions and reactions reminded me of that again. And no matter how many times you rewatch it, you’ll never get bored. That’s the kind of masterpiece this is.
Overall rating: 10/10
One Punch Man is a masterpiece. I’ve been watching anime for about 8 years, watched around 400 anime series, and I’d only have around 5 anime which I’d give a 10/10. But this show is just simply that good. If I could I’d have given this a 999/10 for enjoyment. Studio Madhouse is just leagues ahead of any anime studio. I wish I could go to Japan and personally congratulate them for making such a great anime. While I’m at that, I could also beg them to make a Season 2 of the anime when the manga has enough material for it. Natsume Shingo, the director of this anime, deserves all the credit for bringing together an amazing team, and voice cast to create this anime. Overall, One Punch Man does what it sets out to deliver, Entertain. And boy oh boy it does so in style!!",10,MonsterLiebert

                There are only two types of people in the world: one who absolutely love One Punch Man, and other who strongly dislike it for being too predictable. Now finally that the anime is over, I can review it properly. 
Story: 8/10
One Punch Man is an action-comedy anime which tells a story about a man named Saitama who is 'a hero just for fun' in a world where monsters and heroes are quite common. He is quite overpowered and manages to kill anyone in just a single punch, which has made his life quite boring. Soon a new cyborg named Genos is introduced who is in
                  search for another robot who destroyed his village and he later requests Saitama to become his master after seeing his strength.
At first the story sounds quite predictable and the idea of killing anyone in a single punch adds more to it. Yes, it's true! It becomes a little predictable and the humor of killing anyone in a single punch dies off quickly. But the anime doesn't has only that much to offer. The story starts developing from 5th episode with the introduction of Hero Association and a ranking system which classifies heroes into C class, B class, A class and S class having rankings in each class. New characters are introduced and the story becomes more interesting. The last two arcs were very good, so just don't drop the anime in your early episodes thinking that it's getting predictable or is not worth watching.
Art: 10/10
This is the best element of One Punch Man! The art of this anime is fabulous. Madhouse has again done a wonderful job. The backgrounds are really well done and the fighting scenes are amazing. Infact One Punch Man and Fate/Zero are the best graphics anime I have seen in my life! One Punch Man is actually a pretty average budget anime. The secret behind One Punch Man's amazing graphics lies behind the fact that it has been directed by Shingo Natsume (Key animator of Gurren Lagann, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Hachimitsu to Clover), assisting Kazuya Murata and with the legendary Kenichi Konishi supervising the animation, Sejoon Kim (animator of Gundam) as a regular animation director. Another notable element of One-Punch Man's visuals is the digital animation, something also tied to Natsume's presence. Other than the animation staff, there is someone else who deserves special credit. People who have read Yusuke Murata's version of One-Punch Man – the one the anime is based on – know that even before the anime, the series already was animated. Sort of. Sometimes rather arbitrarily, Murata would go on to draw sequences step-by-step with a ridiculous level of detail, almost as if they were key animation sheets. Something he is capable of putting off because he's an exceptional and dedicated artist, but also because he is a fan of animation.
Sound: 10/10
Another element of One Punch Man which makes the show amazing! Opening and Ending song, both are wonderful. I keep listening to both of them over and over again because they are that awesome. All the OSTs are also worth listening to, and some are just superb which may give you goosebumps! Voice acting is also top notch. Many talented voice actors like Miyano Mamoru, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kaji Yuki, Sakurai Takahiro, Nakamura Yuuichi, Hayami Saori, Namikawa Daisuke etc are there and they have done a great job.
Character: 10/10
All the characters are quite likeable. They have unique personalities and possess a unique charm in themselves. 
I will write a few words on my (and people's) most favorite characters from One Punch Man:
1. Saitama - Our favorite hero, the protagonist of the show, quite humorous.
2. Genos - Saitama's partner, best disciple, cyborg and cool. 
3. Mumen Rider - C class hardworking hero who rides a cycle but is physically pretty weak to fight with monsters but is very courageous and hardworking/
4. Sonic - A ninja! What more? Everybody likes ninjas (Naruto haters please keep it low! -_-)
5. Tatsumaki? - You know what I am talking about if you have seen 11th episode of One Punch Man! ;) [If you still don't understand, let me know -_-']
Enjoyment: 10/10
I really enjoyed One Punch Man because of it's intense action which were beautified by amazing graphics and coated with amazing soundtracks.
Overall: 9.6/10
If you like action-comedy (with frequent serious arcs), adventure and superpower anime, and elements like graphics and sound are an important factor for you then you MUST WATCH this anime! Even if you don't like all that, you can give it a try. I assure you that One Punch Man is NOT some random cliche anime which has random power boosts which makes it impossible to watch. It is quite entertaining.
P.S-Comments appreciated :)",10,Rkpandey

                When it comes to satires and parodies alike, there really isn't any sort of arithmetic equation or analytical evaluation needed to determine its value. To put it as simply, it all boils down to a rudimentary question: were you kept amused and were you entertained? 
If you said ""no"" then that's fine, there really isn't any need to justify that answer any further, same also applies if you had said ""yes."" You see, shows geared to keep you amused are that simple, the same way disliking or liking a specific genre of music doesn't inherently determine its worth to the next person to listen to
                  it. Of course, there are many different brands of comedies out there, some sub-genres of which can be measured by its degree of writing and comedic timing, but this should also come with the understanding that within the marginalizing of ""comedy"" as a genre, there are also room for low-brow humor that relies entirely on dick jokes and crass observations. I say all this to make this point, comedy, like music and other forms of interests that determine an individual's taste, is at essence, a subjective thing. And when something's worth is dependent entirely on whether someone is amused/entertained or not, it's automatically a magnet for contention. For everyone that finds a joke funny, there will be those that stand in opposition.
One Punch Man is a joke that's rather predictable and repetitive if you only care for the punchline but at the same time, a great deal more satisfying if you're keen to the subject matter that's following up to its inevitable destination. In a way, it's an inside joke among friends, just done so for everyone else to hear. It isn't trying to hide it, there's no workaround into deciphering any deep seeded message. What you see is precisely what you get. One Punch Man is a lineage carried over from super sentai/superhero/shounen stories that took a look at itself in the mirror and came to a simple conclusion; that conclusion being that super sentai/superhero/shounen shows are hilarious. 
No really, think about it for a second. It's a form of storytelling that was forged from the need to give moral messages by embodying everything in basic ""black or white"" terms, where you either stand for good or evil. What makes it funny is that these absurd stories are often played straight with no witticism or awareness of its laughable morality message whatsoever. It's a stone-faced, Bible thumping message on morality that's delivered to its audience by grown men and women wearing brightly colored spandex. It's the kind of irony that's only feasible within the realm of fiction, but hilarious in real life when examined. Of course, the inherent silliness of superhero stories have given rise to many satirical outlooks on the subject matter, but for the most part, those aimed more so to poke fun of that form of storytelling, rather than laughing along with it. But every now and then we get a show that isn't out to sully the impact of the subject matter being satirized, instead, it embraces it to its full extent. Rather than teetering between comical nonsense and serious commentary, it decides why to bother holding up that facade, to begin with. It's a show that comes to the conclusion that if you're going to be bat shit crazy, you might as well go all the way.
Ladies and gentlemen this long winded intro is written for the sole purpose of introducing an anime that does just that, One Punch Man. Not only is it aware of the utter nonsense that populates the super sentai/superhero landscape, but it figures that there's no point in trying to deny it. It's a show that revels in the stupidity with no shame or care for onlookers. It's an anime that's comfortable in its spandex suit and flaunts it for all to see. It's a joke that tells you to put away the analytical scrutiny, loosen up your thinking cap, and just come along for the good ole dumb ride that's about to take place. 
As I've already previously stated, your individualistic feelings for the show is the deciding factor on its inherent value. So with that being said, this review is written from the point of view of someone who, for the most part, found the journey with OPM to be satisfactory. Whether you disagree with this statement or not isn't important. I'm not here to tell you OPM is great, and I'm not here to tell you it's anything deeper than what it is; rather, I'm here to explain what kinks OPM managed to properly iron out, and where I as a viewer found noticeable bumps on the journey.
While OPM provided a great deal of entertainment, it also had its fair share of issues that detracted from the overall experience. For one, if this anime was created with less effort on the part of the studio (Madhouse) with its audiovisuals, there would be little to credit it for otherwise. The driving force behind OPM is how pristine and well-oiled it looks and feels as a product. This is an anime that relies heavily on the platform of storytelling it is using. This is an anime that works so well because it IS an anime. It's the sense of scale behind every action being taken by our characters. The impact and fluidity of every animated movement. The hyper-detail behind every intricately choreographed action set-piece and moments of high-octane clashes. The flurry of saturated color that follows every frame. The elastic expressions of the personalities in motion. This is an anime that takes full advantage of its medium, and had it been a show that coasted along to a by-the-numbers checklist, there wouldn't be any need to discuss it at all. This was a passion project brought to life in spectacular fashion. Everything from the traditional heavy metal guitar riffs in the background, to the highly detailed shading of the character designs, makes this feel like more than an assembly line production simply made for profit, it became a work of passion.
It stands to reason that the audiovisual presentation and aesthetic appeal was what propelled this show to instant stardom. So the question remains, why is it so aggressively detested by others?
If you've seen the arguments from detractors of the show, you've undoubtedly caught wind of the ""One Joke Man"" mantra, and to be quite honest, that isn't a bad assessment of the show in a nutshell. Saitama, our lead character and resident impersonator of Mr. Clean, is a man that has grown bored of his acquired strength in pursuit to become a superhero. For reasons vaguely explained, he has reached a point where he can obliterate his foes in one punch. And if you were expecting a ""but"" at the end of that sentence, don't hold your breath, this is the joke. It's like the climatic end to a battle shounen, where our main character goes through his training arc and defeats the antagonist, after he hit his ultimate form of over-powered potential... but instead of simply ending the story there, we're given an extended ""what if"" prologue that asks the question: what happens after the final conflict is over, after our hero reaches the apex of the beat 'em up food chain?
And from that question emerges this product; this joke. And while there is an overarching story unfolding in the background, it's the joke that takes precedence and placed on center-stage for our amusement. And it's this joke that creates the split among those who adore the show and those that carry around the ""One Joke Man"" picket sign in protest to its popularity. As trivial of an argument it may seem, this comedic gag is the reason for the rift among anime viewers, which has become a joke within itself (super meta shit). 
There are two main parts to the overarching story: one of which involves Saitama and his ironic post-climb to the top of a superhero organization to gain recognition, while also trying to fulfill his excessive need to seek out an enemy that can finally put up a challenge. And the other subplot revolves around his apprentice and eventual friend, Genos, who's goal can be seen as the stereotypical hero story of vengeance. And while both stories are played straight, it's the awareness the show has for its content which lets everyone in on the joke, and also what makes the parody of the subject matter both amusing, and in a weird way, self-indulgent. While the show follows these narratives in a fashion expected, it does so with a constant sense of witticism and deliberate elbow nudging. This, as a result, can lead to scenes where expository dialogue is given, while our lead is trying to dismiss it, the equivalent of which is like the character breaking the fourth wall and looking into the camera saying ""isn't this shit boring? I wish he would shut up already!"" It's these moments that make what can be seen as a fairly common story, into one that's not only fun to follow, but also something like brownie points for the viewer that are keen to the observations. It's an anime that actively interacts with the expectation of the audience watching it. And while these moments still play second-fiddle to the constant beat 'em up action on screen, it's those moments that give OPM its sense of identity. 
Speaking of the beat 'em up action, OPM effectively nails this aspect down without much debate. While the satirical moments sprinkled throughout shines in its own way, it's the fight scenes that elevates this title to a growing household name. It's the fuel behind the hype if you will. And while that may be a superficial reason to bolster its value, it's still a viable reason for the sake of consumable entertainment. One of its primary genres is action after all, and when it comes to action, very few shows can stand as competition to the consistent level of quality encapsulated in OPM.
The characters of OPM are just that, characters. You're not looking at them for any profound message or character depth, rather it's the eccentricity of the personalities themselves that works. From the typical hero of justice stereotypes found in characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, to the more obvious satirized ones like Amai Mask and Metal Bat. It's comic book personalities brought to life and set loose, all for the sole purpose of wacky antics and populating the setting with a garden variety of personas. The villains can range from the ultra-silly like a lobsterman wearing underwear (similar to something found in the likes of super sentai works), to the more maniacal dimensionless baddie who's sole purpose in life is to fight strong opponents (similar to that of most battle shounens). It's this variety of Saturday morning cartoon level characters that keep things fresh. And with the over-exaggerated character designs, it becomes even more elevated than what would typically be seen from this kind of show. 
Although, this, as a result, creates the most shallow cast imaginable, and while they're still endearing in the already goofy backdrop they're placed in, they're not in any way new to what would come out of this brand of storytelling. The more you buy into the comedic outlook the show presents everything in, the easier it is to buy into their placement in the story.
This, of course, leads to one of the more noticeable problems the show can't seem to get a grasp on, and that's that nothing it does can be taken seriously. The show goes out of its way to paint everything in clown makeup, so when it does try to take things down a more serious route the final result is more of an apathetic shrug and resounding ""who cares,"" than anything you can deem potent. This isn't to say that those more serious moments don't hold meaning, but that in the context of a parody that has been doing nothing but laughing along with the audience, the moments are simply unwarranted. It's like if a stoner comedy stopped everything dead in its tracks to present a D.A.R.E speech against the use of drugs. Thankfully these moments aren't ever-present throughout the show's run-time. 
Another issue that many might have with OPM is quite obviously the joke itself. Being that it's a repetitive comedic gag, many might find the novelty of the gag to have less impact as the show goes on. This, of course, is a reasonable concern, since variety is what keeps long-running sitcoms and comedies on the air. The show attempts to alleviate that concern with the involvement of characters like Genos, who serves as the duality to Saitama's placement in the story. 
And then there's Saitama himself, who is a deadpan protagonist for a majority of the show's run-time. Those unfamiliar or simply indifferent to deadpan humor will of course not find anything in Saitama, making him uninteresting to most, and rightfully so. And like the concern of the run-on joke losing its luster, the myriad of other wacky characters introduced are the show's defense to keep the attentiveness of those who simply can't be bothered with the uncaring and often cynical outlook Saitama is given. This isn't a case where the lead is a blank slate, but rather he's a character that should have already been done with his arc and involvement in the story. This is the follow up to where a typical hero story should have ended, the downward spiral of a man who has already achieved all that there is to do in his given universe. Which of course is the point of this prolog inspired series, but like I've already stated, the inherent value of OPM rests with the viewer's taste in comedy, so this problem may not even register at all to a lot of people.
But despite these indeterminate shortcomings, the show still manages to do enough to keep itself together. Because it's so self-aware, a great deal of these issues is often made to be null and void. It's hard to dissect a show that is so honest about what it is. This doesn't wash away the issues it may have, but it certainly makes it more palatable to a consumer that isn't necessarily concerned about it.
Enjoyment: 9/10
I can go on and on about what the show had working against it, but at the end of the day, I walked away with a title that constantly kept me entertained. The fights were great fun, the animation was handled with care, the OST was kickass, the satirical jabs kept me cackling, and above all else, I was more than satisfied as a viewer and fellow enthusiast of anime. Sure the run-on gag lost steam at times, and yes the plot wasn't always engaging, but as far as enjoyment is concerned, OPM scratched an itch that previously only Jojo of the same year was able to.
Overall: 7/10
Is One Punch Man over-hyped? Yes, it certainly is. But does that make it inherently bad? No, it doesn't. While it may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that its contemporaries are of less than stellar quality, there are still merits to the appraisal it receives. It isn't a title that will break new ground anytime soon, and partially, it's a Frankenstein who's existence can be credited with the recent high demand for superhero stories in pop culture. But as an action-comedy that's out to simply have fun and revel in the absurdity of its story, One Punch Man is a show that can keep even the most jaded of audiences entertained, and if only for that aspect alone, I think it's worth trying out.",7,ZephSilver

                One-Punch Man is pretty much exactly like what it sounds. We got a bald guy named Saitama who literally beats his opponents with a single punch. He is so powerful that throughout his life, he gets bored with the opponent he fights with. Because when a guy like him can beat up opponents with just one punch, it doesn’t get very fun right? Regardless, Saitama has a heart of gold and in this series, we follow his daily adventures as a hero, as the man who one punches his enemies.
In general, the series is actually a TV anime adaptation of the remake of the web
                  manga by ONE. As such, the art is based on Yusuke Murata’s work rather than the original series. The original web series became an internet sensation as it began publishing in June 2009. Given the nature of the series as well the fast growing popularity, there’s a lot of expectations coming from fans about the adaptation. Honestly, I can say that it’s also a sensation. 
Directed by Shingo Natsume, he became more well-known recently with his involvement with directing Space Dandy. For One-Punch Man, the series would have to go all out and tear the house down with what it has to offer. The first episode easily establishes the show as an animation powerhouse with the high production quality by Madhouse. The fighting movements, rapid camera angles, and overall cinematics is stellar throughout many of its action sequences. In addition, Saitama’s role easily makes him entertaining to watch because of just simply how badass he is despite being drawn in such a simple way. With a bald head, average height, muscular toned body, and heroish cape, he is the guy that everyone needs to keep an eye on. What mostly makes Saitama stands out is his way of fighting. Yes, most of his fights are rather quick fashioned because of how overpowered he is. I think at some point, Saitama can be dubbed as ‘One-OP Man’ just because of how ridiculous he is with the way his fights concludes. His hero name is ‘Caped Baldy’ and it’s pretty self-explanatory why.
I’d like to picture One-Punch Man as more of a parody, a satire of superheroes and battle shounen. While the story of One-Punch Man isn’t a masterpiece, it’s still appealing because of Saitama’s daily adventures. These adventures takes him to new places, conflicts with new enemies, and also establishing alliances with new friends. One of his most prominent friends is Genos, a cyborg dubbed as the “Demon Cyborg”. He is Saitama’s disciple and often tries to earn his respect. Their growing relationship seems peculiar at first but also very amusing to watch as they have a fun chemistry. The majority of the other characters of the series are part of a group known as the Hero Association, an organization apparently formed with the purpose to fight monsters and protect City Z. What’s unique about the Hero Association is that the group is composed of all type of heroes ranging from a child prodigy, psycho esper, prideful samurai, or even genius scientists. Throughout Saitama’s daily adventures, he also encounters a variety of adversaries and villains. Whether it’s speedy ninjas or oversized sea monsters, Saitama always seems to find a way to defeat them. This might be the part that strains some people from watching. A common question that may pop up is “what’s the point then if Saitama can just one hit KO all his opponents?” or “What’s the fun in that?”
I think the main objective of the show is to portray the action as a parody. It’s like the show is self-aware especially with Saitama’s antics. This extends to his iconic fight with Genos, the invasion of Boros’ forces, or his training test to become a hero. Although the comedy can feel exaggerated, it’s also very engaging with all sort of gags the show tries to pull. Every episode also introduces a diverse range of heroes or monsters so there’s plenty to offer for those looking into variety. Certain underrated characters such as License-less Rider also gets their spotlight of fame so the show isn’t just entirely about Saitama. As the comedy can occasionally feel overwhelming, it’s still delightful with the character expressions (mostly coming from Saitama) and excitement it brings. Even the dialogues can offer a sharp appeal that will give the fans to remember something about.
Even with all the comedy, there’s still some set of standards the show follows. The rankings of the Hero Association such as “S-Rank” or “B-Rank” have meanings behind them that associates with their reputation. Unfortunately, Saitama is assigned a lesser rank than most may expect mostly because of his appearance. Only a few recognizes his true abilities although he himself doesn’t seem to care that much either. What he does care though is being a hero and that’s something to really be recognized. While most of his fights ends in just one punch, the way Saitama performs it is bizarrely amusing. One minute, he is starring into something that appears to be overwhelmingly above his abilities. The next minute that something turns into being punched to oblivion. Saitama’s speed and endurance is also extremely impressive as he has taken superhuman level attacks at point-blank range. Again, some people will notice that his fights tends to be “anti-climatic”. However, look at the bigger picture here. The way Saitama gives his opponents the hope that they will win effortlessly, the dull expressions he shows in the face of danger, and his inability to remember the names of his opponents are also portrayed more as a parody for comical purposes. It then translates to their defeat which is all that much more devastating. That’s almost like an artistic way of fighting. On the other hand, Saitama’s characterization in this adaptation isn’t very promising. There’s not much revealed about his past so you’ll have to search around the OVA to learn more about his background story. And also, while the adaptation captures the magic of the manga (by even adding some workable filler content), it does omit some aspects which fans may be disappointed about.
I’ve said it before but I’ll say it again. Madhouse has proven themselves of animating this to the highest caliber. The action sequences, background scenery, facial expressions, and overall tone of the show is delivered with exquisite art. It also has an experimental feel to it with the way the characters are designed with a wide spectrum of different looks. What’s most interesting is how Saitama is designed with such simple features especially during comedic scenes. Whether human or monster, One-Punch Man stands as a solid testament for an adaptation by animation standards.
The soundtrack is just as powerful especially with some of the character themes that matches with fighting sequences. The OP song also approaches itself with a stereo beat and heroic-like theme of heavy lyrics. On the other hand, Saitama’s voice is pretty normal despite his overwhelming power. However, some other characters voiced in the show is noticeable such as Genos, Tatsumaki, Boros, and a few others of the villain variety. Be prepared for a hyperactive ride.
One-Punch Man may seem a bit overrated as it exploded into popularity. From an internet sensation to a TV smash hit, the series continue to grow. A second season is also likely in the inevitable future as well as mentioned by the producers. And the reason being is the sheer success it has achieved. It might not have Shakespearean level storytelling but it’s definitely something fun to take home with every episode. The battle shounen genre has been around for ages and it’s nice to see how One-Punch Man makes fun of it as a satirical battle blockbuster.",8,Stark700

                After finishing this show I have concluded that it certainly lives up to its name. Oh no no, not the majority opinion of it, silly goose, I mean the actual show title, “One Punch Man,” because this show genuinely does only have ONE joke, and it gets old very, very fast.
Everything you need to know or possibly can know about this anime is in its title. The main character defeats every villain in one punch, but what else? That can’t possibly be it, can it? Well… for all intents and purposes, the show is indeed branded as a parody. But in order for us to
                  see how successful it is at doing so, let me give you the definition of a “parody.” 
Parody; /noun/ “an imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect”
Let’s also look at its synonyms.
mockery, ridicule, satire. Oh there we go, that’s the word. Satire. A satire, and I quote, is the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize a specific “thing,” be it person, place, concept, story, or what-have you. In the case with One Punch Man, the satirical parody is criticizing the Superhero/Shonen genre/demographic and its over the top, predictable nature. Or at least, it would be if it weren’t so incredibly inept at doing so. 
One Punch Man’s humorous scenes are so incredibly few and far between (not to mention hit or miss altogether) that the whole show feels more like a comedic action shonen rather than a parody of one. Does it have its funny moments? Sure, but not enough to constitute it as a successful satire, let alone being an actual criticism of something. All it does is fall into the exact same pitfalls of a regular long-running Shonen manga or Marvel comic, and doesn’t present any kind of commentary or criticism (humorous or not) to anything at all. With a team of mere monkeys, it can be boiled down to a very simple, boring formula.
1.	A threat is present to (insert city here)
2.	Saitama (our hero) arrives and spends 5 to 10 minutes dicking off
3.	Saitama defeats the antagonist with ONE-U PAUNCH-U!!!
4.	Rinse and repeat for next week
So now that we see there is no actual criticism, there’s absolutely no tension in this anime either. While the fight scenes are gorgeously animated (By Madhouse, king of all studios) there’s not much to think or feel when watching one. Sure, there are a lot of pretty colors and explosions and things being destroyed, but do you know what else has that? Transformers. Does Transformers have an engaging plot, or a worthwhile satirical aspect to it? No. Does One Punch Man? No. 
And as far as disgustingly overpowered, boring protagonists go, Saitama isn’t nearly as insufferable as Kirito but he’s not far off the beaten path. He’s bored with his power to defeat anything in one punch, but who blames him? What kind of life is interesting if you have to work at nothing, if there’s no challenge? What kind of show is interesting, if it doesn’t have any kind of identity or intelligence to it? We never even see Saitama’s training, or his trials and tribulations to becoming what he is now; we just get to see the aftermath! Endless rising action, I’m telling you! No climax whatsoever! 
And like every 12 episode anime, this show has a cast of heroes and villains that’s larger than Tom Cruise’s ego, and none of them get any kind of worthy screen time either. The closest we get to any kind of character development is the sidekick of Saitama, Genos. But whatever problem he’s in, whatever dilemma he faces, you can just let go of your worry and kick back, knowing Saitama will ONE PUNCH the FUCK out of whatever has him in its grasp. That just tears to shreds ANY semblance of development or changes that Genos could have gone through. 
In short, the character development is thrown to the curb for running jokes, the humor is stale, the action is boring because it’s so predictable, and the entertainment value is comparable to that of staring at a door. You know its gonna open, and you know its gonna close. Because it’s a door. 
“But Keyboard!” I hear one obligatory reader say aloud, “That’s the point! He defeats everything in One Punch!”
Tell me how that’s entertaining, because I don’t see it. Every episode is literally, and I’m not kidding here, LITERALLY, the exact. same. thing. Imagine watching Superman Returns on repeat, with a little tiny bit of the same SNL skit hiding in the background. Twelve times in a row. That’s not entertaining. 
But if you liked it, good for you. I have nothing against you, I’m glad you’re able to find enjoyment in something my cynical ass mind couldn’t, and I’m being honest when I say that if this show had a little to no following at all, my reaction would be the same, so don’t come to me screaming and hollering about me hating on it because it got popular. I don’t hate popular things, especially when my favorite anime is the highest fucking rated entry on the site. I instead choose to look at what it proposes regardless of its reputation. So, in a TL;DR summary, here is what I found in doing so-
PROS:
-	Gorgeous animation
-	Solid soundtrack
-	Makes you really appreciate the good stuff out there
MIXED:
-	Comedy is hit-or-miss
CONS:
-	Boring, repetitive, and stagnant premise
-	Predictability is through the roof
-	Fails at being a parody because of its hit-or-miss comedy and lack of satirical commentary on what its supposed to be a parody of
-	Not enough comedy altogether 
-	One note side characters, one note villains, one note protagonist. 
-	Title gives everything away
3/10. As of yet, One Punch Man has plenty of time to redeem itself. A second season with a little more improvement on its intention and it could be something really great.
But for now, I recommend watching the door. At least that actually took some ingenuity.",3,KeyMovingForward

                One Punch Man is a comedy/parody shounen anime. Unfortunately it fails as a parody and it fails as a shounen.
The Comedy:
Saitama, the main protagonist, is really really strong, but he's also bored. He is so strong that he doesn't even get excited while fighting really strong opponents. That's the main joke of the anime, and if you don't like it, well, too bad, because it will be shoved down your throat every single episode. There's nothing much else to talk about him, it's basically all his personality. 
Outside of Saitama the humor is pretty much hit or miss. It's funny, because this is supposed to
                  be a parody anime, but even then it takes itself wayyyy too seriously. Expect the typical epic/dramatic ost playing often, innocent people suffering and in danger,  melodramatic speechs about justice, etc etc. After thorwing all that at you the main character, bored as always, will easily defeat the dangerous villain. OPM lives in a weird limbo between typical shounen and parody, it would probably be better if it decided what it wants to be.
The Plot:
The anime is pretty much plotless. A random generic villain  will appear, cause some ruckus, and be defetead by the bored bald protagonist every time. At some point a hero association appears, what about it? It serves to introduce new characters, and that's it. The association does nothing the whole anime, as far as the anime goes there's no conspiracy behind it or anything. The main character wants to go up in the association, but of course that doesn't matter one bit, it only serves to provide some more ""hilarious"" jokes about how the main character is so strong and yet he is misunderstood by everybody. 
There's nothing to keep you hooked and wanting more, wondering what will happen next. If, god forbid, a second season is made I pretty expect to be exactly the same thing as season 1: main protagonist is bored jokes and generic villains appearing, with pretty much nothing else. 
Sound:
Nothing much to talk about really. One or two tracks are good I guess, the rest is average. 
Art/Animation:
The art is bland and forgetble. The animation is good and fluid, but to be honest the fights itselves are not that good. Everything is so fast, it's difficult to see things clearly sometimes. Although this anime really is above average in this category, it seems like a child throwing a tauntrum to get your attention: there is very little variety in the fights (every character pretty much fights like a DBZ character), it is all completely predictable, but hey, it looks cool, and the camera spins really fast, and there is epic music, so it is good, right???
Veridict:
OPM is all flash and no substance. It should mantain your attention for at least these 12 episodes, but that's it. It's just one more of those anime who pander the lowest common denominator. If you are expecting something truly interesting, fun or exciting you can forget it.",3,nowa_

Overall: 9.  
One Punch Man is an anime dedicated for those, including myself, who value more on superb action animation-based quality while putting story-wise and characters on the least priority. Because they focus so much on its animation and art wise, it can lead to double-edge sword for some people. On one hand, great animation and art can rise more enjoyment while putting less effort on story and characters can dampen
                  the level of enjoyment. 
So in order not to be slightly betrayed by this, I recommend people to shift their mode of thinking from being too serious to become ""why so serious"". That is, you should not having put too much thinking on characters and story as it may erode your enjoyment, but the erosion rate on characters and story might be slower than erosion rate based on action animation variables because its animation is so good to be re-watched and there are no annoying characters traits. 
FOr the story, it is just there for the sake of completeness or as a complementary element for its near-perfect animation quality.
Those people who score One Punch Man as below 8 might weight more on story as their anchoring on Death Note's story quality standard while people, including myself, who score 8 and above is biased by the animation alone, but more than enough to satisfy their fundamental needs when watching anime.",9,KUNYIT

To be honest with you, I've been bored with anime for quite a while now.  Sure, I've been watching some anime but it's mostly restricted to anime that have already finished or are over 10 years old. 
So, naturally, when I heard about One Punch Man, I brushed it off as more of the same old sh*t that's been airing for the past five years. How wrong I was....
Now, after waiting patiently for over 81 days, I have come to put an end to all the ridiculous criticism that
                  One Punch Man has received.

Story
We as a community tend to immediately gang up on the most popular anime at the time, I'm looking at you SAO. As you can guess, it's open season for OPM.
Unlike most animes these days, with their overly ambitious stories and pretentious settings, what we have here is a show that doesn't take itself  TOO SERIOUSLY or TOO FLIPPANTLY. T̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶d̶o̶e̶s̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶m̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶s̶e̶n̶s̶e̶,̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶d̶i̶p̶s̶h̶  What do I mean by this? Although, it's ranked the 11th greatest anime and already has 192,406 members on MAL, it only came into existence as a hobby for upcoming manga artist, ONE. Yes, the anime with an average score of 9.02, was only made because ONE was BORED. You'd think that this would mean an eventual drop in quality or failure to even kick-start the series, right?
In short, no. It is this boredom that leads into ONE's creative and innovative ideas. What's a genre that suits ONE perfectly and hasn't been explored enough? SUPERHEROES. Combine this with comedy, and you have a brand new genre in itself. This show is primarily focused on being a parody of the superhero genre as a whole. This is where the show really thrives with pretty much every superhero cliché you've ever heard of packed neatly into 12 episodes. From the overpowered as f*ck main character to the diabolically evil as f*ck simply because they are ugly as f*ck. One Punch Man takes all these clever jokes and uses them to their full potential and somehow manages to never falter in it's quality or it's quantity. 
I see a lot of reviews for this anime saying,""You shouldn't take this seriously or it's only a COMEDY"". While I'm in inclined to agree with the later and will rephrase in case you weren't listening, IT'S JUST A F*CKING COMEDY YOU NEON GENESIS SADISTS. In the case of ""being serious enough"", OPM has this near perfection. Typical comedy based animes will often have a moment where it trades it's usual light hearted comedy for a moment of ""seriousness"". OPM only has a few moments of ""seriousness"" but because there are so little of them it only makes them more MEMORABLE and IMPACTFUL. They will often deal with topics like morality, media, defining a hero etc.
Eat your heart out Clannad, I can have deep meaningful moments and still be pissing myself with laughter 5 minutes later.
Characters
The main hero of the story is Saitama, who is every lead shonen character's wet dream. Saitama is the incarnation of BOREDOM and it is less about how funny he IS but how funny he REACTS.The point of his character is that he has ALREADY ""become the strongest in the world"", which is then used as the overrunning gag throughout the show. This is quite a fresh idea that would pique the interest of most people. Although, this idea can only remain funny for so long the same way any joke will become tiring after a while.
This is only saved thanks to a certain blond haired cyborg by the name of Genos. While Saitama is the incarnation of BOREDOM, Genos is the incarnation of SERIOUSNESS. He is the Naruto/Luffy/Ichigo of the story, the one who is obsessed with becoming stronger, except as more of a dead serious, humourless sidekick. People like to believe that Saitama being so incredibly overpowered ironically ruins the show but this is not the case. While we can't relate to Saitama's ridiculous strength, we can relate to Genos constant struggle for power. While we can't relate to Genos' dashing good looks (well, you can't), we can relate to Saitama's plain and average looks.
*I have to give high praise to both Furukawa and Ishikawa for their respective performances as Saitama and Genos which was nothing short of AWESOME*
As for the supporting characters, it would be best described as if you were visiting your favourite restaurant. With so many different types and variations to select from these characters are all excellently made. We've got Silverfang, who is the equivalent of Dumbledore on steriods, Sonic, who is Saitama's never ending rival and is definitely not a hedgehog, Tatsumaki, who is an annoying little sh*t, and a load more of strong and weak, cool and weird, smart and stupid characters that you will encounter throughout the show.

You add it's incredible animation by Madhouse with this soundtrack, and you've got Gold. 
Even the sound in this show is INSANE, just take a look at the fight between Saitama and Genos. I'd highly recommend giving OPM's OST a listen to as it's well worth your time.
Overall
Let's get something clear. I'm not giving OPM a 10 because it's perfect. ALL SHOWS HAVE FAULTS. I'm giving it a 10 because it reached it's full potential but still managed to keep it's humour, action, characters in check throughout these incredible 12 episodes. A satisfying conclusion with no silly cliffhangers or overarching plot points.
* BREAKING NEWS!! We have just received news about the possibility of a second season and I can officially tell you.....how the f*ck am I supposed to know?!

                One Punch Man is an action comedy anime. If you expect deep meening, you're done. If you expect horror or something meaningfull, you're watching the wrong anime.
If you know wha you're about to watch and you are happy with it, OPM is awesome. It has humour, strange characters, a simple story and lots of meaningless action.
Story: 10/10
Saitama is strong. And being the strongest is boring. Going through life looking for someone stronger or at least entertaining is a funny concept, specially when no one actually knows how strong you are.

You can't go wrong with JAM Project. And everything, from voices to BGM is exactly in its's place and helps a lot with the show and the almost non existent plot.

You can't not like Saitama, even the secondary and tertiary characters are easy to like. There's no really great character development, but that's not what you're looking for in OPM. Saitama is the strongest. And that's how it's supposed to be.
Enjoyment: 10/10
You're going to discover this will be the fastest 22 minutes of your week. It's easy to lose yourself in an episode and you will see it ending, you will hate that damn lock, and you won't be able to believe how fast time travel when you're entertained.

The show has extremely simple plot; yet they managed to stretch it throughout 12 episodes in a way that you question life, learn lessons and respect a bald guy who isn't your grandfather. 
Fight scenes contain fantastic animation quality and themes that vary from comical to epic. I didn't like the opening song at first but after a couple episodes it's catchy so I stopped skipping it. Disliked the ending song but I think that's mostly because it made me realize I have to wait a whole week for another episode.

                Goddamn, last season was heavy on the shonen/superhero stuff, wasn't it? Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya. Ushio and Tora. Noragami Aragoto. And of course, the most popular one of them all, One Punch Man. It's going to be difficult to find something new to say about each of them, but lord knows I'm going to try my damndest to do so. Might as well start with the one that got everyone's attention, even if not for all the right reasons. I mean it's a giant understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who watched One Punch Man, but it's also a
                  big understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who wasn't impressed with the thing.
It's even worse in my case, because I don't get shonen action as substance at all. I don't hate it, and there was a time when I enjoyed pretty much everything that came out of Shonen Jump's mouth the same way I enjoyed Marvel v. Capcom, but you'd think the genre would grow up along with the audience and focus more on substance rather than repeat the same outdated Dragonball Z-style over and over again because holy hell did we not get sick of that ten years ago. But with the explosive popularity of One Punch Man along with David Production continuing to make more bloody adaptations of Jojo, I think it's pretty clear that that isn't going to happen anytime soon. So who cares if the plot is weak? Who cares if the satire goes for all the easy shots? Who cares if the characters don't have any real struggles or flaws or story or anything going for them besides how they look and a stupid name? It's a popcorn anime, and it's very good at what it does.
Except even by the standards of popcorn anime, I'm not sure it does. I mean you have the director of Space Dandy and the production values from Madhouse on this project, so obviously you're going to get a great-looking show. With that said, why is the action so fucking bad? Every time it showed up, the camera would spin around or zoom far-out whilst characters threw massive explosions at each other or delivered a punch in a desperate attempt to make it look cool when in reality, it looks overblown and retarded. There is absolutely no choreography being applied to any of the action and it becomes really boring to watch as a result. And even if there was, it is an absolute cakewalk to determine who's going to win the fight before it even starts because the whole show is built around Saitama saving the day in his own dry way with nobody in the entire universe being close to his level in terms of fighting prowess. Add in the fact that nobody really dies in this show anyways but the one-off characters who have less charisma than a Marvel villain and there's a limit to how much tension One Punch Man is allowed to have in regards to its fight scenes (i.e. zero).
Not helping is the fact that Saitama is an incredibly boring character who has no depth to him besides one joke: he's a normal dude who became the strongest in the world by training really hard and is bored with his life as a result. Every other hero in this show became powerful through genetics or body modification, and as such don't believe Saitama when he says that he just worked hard, nor do they trust him because thanks to his lack of brains, he's lowly ranked in the Hero Association. This could have made for some interesting conflict, but One Punch Man never really treats Saitama's invincibility as anymore than a cheap joke or a deus ex machina trying to be a cheap joke, no thanks to the other heroes having zero chemistry with the dude and making DC's good guys look like Marvel's. Aside from a cyborg whose only real purpose in life is to lose so that Saitama can have someone to save, I can't recall a single time he's ever had a real conversation with anybody. Hell, I'm pretty sure Genos has had more overall screen time than him.
And don't even get me started on the villains in this thing, who make Marvel's bad guys look like DC's. I can't even remember anyone's name, let alone what they added to anything. There was some attempt at making the final bad guy an ""invincible contrast"" to Saitama, but it was so poorly handled it made the relationship between Spiderman and Green Goblin look like Batman and The Joker - and I still didn't bother to remember the dude's name afterwards. Word of advice to anyone creating a bad guy: Marvel's villains are absolutely awful! Nothing but a bunch of random animal or element gimmicks applied to some misguided fool trying to overcompensate for the fact that Mad Hatter has them beat in the character department. But you know what's worse than that? Actual animal or element gimmicks fully realized in physical form, without even an attempt to make them realized as actual characters.
All of which could have been forgiven if the show was funny, as One Punch Man is supposed to be a comedic satire on the shonen action/superhero genre. Thing is, the show only has one joke (Saitama being Saitama) and said joke never made me laugh. Not once. Which would already have been a giant problem by itself, but the fact that the satire sucks too does it no favors. And not just because it goes for all the easy shots, but said shots are even misaimed a few times. There's one moment in the show where Saitama makes himself out to be the bad guy in order to save face for the other heroes due to some random jackass who apparently never appreciates anything in his life, but it falls incredibly flat because it's incredibly obvious it was done so that the show can repeat its one joke. Not one single person was buying the jackass's bullshit, so there was no reason for Saitama to do that, especially since it's never brought up again afterwards. It's an extreme, but by no means the only part of the show where it's clear the writers have no ambition for this show beyond taking cheap potshots at a genre that has been satirized so well in the past.
Let me make it clear that One Punch Man is by no stretch of the word ""bad"". It knows what it wants to be and does it well, even if it wants to be is nothing higher than mediocre at best. Because if we're judging it in comparison to the rest of the shonen/superhero anime that aired in Fall, One Punch Man is the worst of the shonen action anime that I have seen. Good visuals can only take you so far, and whilst I commend Madhouse for keeping the quality high for most of its run, thirteen episodes is a long time to watch something that has little to no substance. Hell, the specials don't have anything noteworthy about them visual-wise, leaving you with nothing at all.
My advice to you guys? Watch Concrete Revolutio instead. And no, I'm not going to stop sucking Concrete Revolutio's dick until more people admit they were wrong to abandon it for the much weaker Sunday superhero show.",4,Flawfinder

Overall - this series has a lot of potential, a comedic parody of shouen anime. However, the execution of this series is very poor.
Story - There is little to no discernible story line it seems, and whatever is there is needless drawn out and fraught with cliche, that more or less parody shouen story-lines, but without providing any actual comedy. Basically turning into a shitty version of what they are trying to make fun of.
Art/Sound - Only redeeming element of this anime, the art style is fantastic and it comes with a very good audio quality, the
                  voice acting is about average.
Characters - Characters in this series tend to come off as extremely bland, and boring. This is quite a shame since the design and back story's of these characters are very interesting. This combined with decent voice acting should provide a decent set of characters. However, it doesn't this time, and it is very disappointing  
In conclusion - This is a very disappointing series, fantastic art and sound combine with an awful story and lackluster characters make this series just disheartening and one of the most boring anime I have ever seen",3,whytehfnot

                With One-Punch Man finished airing, there is one thing anyone can agree on, and that is how split the community is about the show: there are people who absolutely love it, considering it the pinnacle of their experience, and others that consider it to be very bland and boring, with terrible humour. Now the question is whether these opinions on the show are justified or not, and naturally it is, on both sides. Is One-Punch Man overrated? Yes, it is. But is it mediocre, bad? No, in my opinion it is not, it's an enjoyable anime with fantastic animation and action.
~Story~
The premise of One-Punch Man
                  is simple, Saitama being a superhero so overpowered, that he is capable of defeating any type of villain in one single punch. Bored with the fights, he trudges through life indifferent to any major problems regarding his environment, such as monsters attacking the city, concerned mainly with the household such as his shopping list or vandalism. This doesn't mean that there is any lack of action at all; in fact it is one of its main focus, which is fun to watch. This leads to another problem: the fights are tensionless on its own, as it is very predictable what the outcome will be, which is partially adressed with comedic elements. The good thing is that the anime is self-aware of its stupidity,being quite unpredictable at times, which makes it in turn an enjoyable watch.
Other focal point of the anime is the humor, as One-Punch Man makes a parody of the superheroes, which enhances the anime to keep the story fresh and enjoyable. Someone who dislikes superheroes might also dislike this show. These jokes are often mingled with Saitama's indifference, as well as the characters personalities. However, the humor seems to be the major issue with the audience. Yet I must mention that the humor gets old, and is not as well relayed  to the viewers as it was in the manga. In fact, at times it can be rather lackluster. Nevertheless, the action scenes made up for it. Other thing to consider is the amount of destruction made by the superheroes, which could be seen as something hilarious, meaning they're quite useless when trying to preserve property and life.
There is also certain evolution of the story present; from focusing upon making a parody of defeating its foes in one hit, it makes a transition to have some sort of story attached to it, introducing challenges and ranks amongst the superheroes, invasion of super villains, you name it. This defeats somewhat the main purpose of the anime, as now it's basically a plotless, action heavy show. Some may also point out that the episodes seem stretched out longer than necessary. Nevertheless, audiences observe social critique as well in the anime, which could be compared with how society views celebrities. Superheroes represent these, people excepting them to be perfect, which is naturally not the case. The egoistic nature of humans are shown as well, in addition to blaming people for their own ailments, even though these tried to help out. People are prone to blame others for their own misdoings or doesn't go flawlessly.
~Characters~
The characters in One-Punch Man are varied, yet very one-dimensional and stereotypical, which fits with the narrative and overall story that it is trying to convey. Saitama being an indifferent character to anything concerning him; then there is Genos, a cyborg with a straightforward personality who is Saitama's disciple. Naturally little to no character development takes place. The superheroes themselves are often of selfish nature, whose only objective is fame.
The cast of characters are diverse, both for the superheroes and villains: ninjas, cyborgs, aliens, martial artists, mad scientists and monsters are on the order of the day. The reasons behind villains actions are of course very bland and uninteresting, as it follows the stereotypes. Nonetheless, it must be mentioned that some of the comedic elements are greatly enhanced by these and their personalities, in addition to being somewhat interesting in some regards.
~Animation and sound~
The animation quality of One-Punch Man is certainly top-notch, action scenes drawn fantastically and very fluid and diverse, what is to be expected of a Madhouse produced anime. There are some scenes in which some movements are bended a bit too much to my liking. The art style of the anime if appealing, yet nothing really out of the norm. Character designs for villains and superheroes are nevertheless diverse and very detailed, further enhancing the overall animation. In addition, backgrounds are well displayed as well. The animators managed to portray impressively the strengths of the superheroes with the diverse animations and camera angles.
The soundtrack used in One-Punch Man matched well with it, yet is nothing outstanding on its own. Voice actors performed their role well, in addition to matching with the personality of each character. The opening was quite an interesting watch, in addition to have a fitting music to it.
~Enjoyment~
Overall One-Punch Man was an enjoyable experience, yet experienced shortcomings storywise as well as in the comedy department. Nevertheless, the well executed action scenes alongside the top-notch animation quality, certainly makes it worth a watch on its own, yet is not suited for anyone who is in pursuit of a well crafted story alongside with good and diverse humour, as it can be a hit-and-miss for some.

                Jesus christ, calm the fuck down. It's a pretty good anime. It is neither the greatest nor the worst thing to ever be produced, contrary to how most people seem to be treating it.
It's a shame that such a disclaimer is necessary, but there really only seem to be two kinds of people when it comes to One Punch Man - those who consider it a cancer on the anime industry, and those who worship it as though it were the second coming. And while, in all honesty, this would probably not be as hyped as it is if it weren't the only thing coming
                  out at the time worth being hyped over, it's a lot closer to the latter than the former.
Of course, there was always going to be a divide with this show, because it's a comedy series that doesn't really have many jokes in it. Much of the humour of One Punch Man is achieved through tone and through juxtaposition, and that's not something that works for everyone.
One of the best methods of humour comes from the unexpected - juxtaposition between what you'd expect to happen, and what does. One Punch Man uses this to great effect, by building up a fictional universe in which everything takes itself completely seriously with the same dramatic stakes that would apply to any battle shonen anime, totally unaware that absolutely everything they believe to be true, and which they take so seriously, is completely and utterly meaningless, because Saitama makes the entire setting redundant. It's a hilarious farce that forms the core of the show.
In fact, Saitama is the perfect protagonist for a show like this. His inability to read the mood, lack of concern for any of the extremely threatening Eldritch Horrors that attack him, and his nonchalance towards... well, everything, make a great setup for the contrast of tone between over-the-top badassery and comedy that this show runs on.
The rest of what makes this show work is that it's actually pretty good as the action series it's making fun of. While it is impossible to take seriously, it's still hard to not be impressed by how well-drected and inventive the fight scenes are. The animators have really outdone themselves here - in particular, the way they show off some of Saitama's most ridiculously overpowered attacks are impressive.
The downside, however, is that sometimes the show takes itself too seriously - in particular, during the mid-to-late episodes. While the balance between action and comedy is usually well maintained, it suffers when it skews more towards action. Also, OPM is often accused of being repetitive, and this isn't entirely unfounded - again, the show doesn't really rely on jokes for its humour, and instead goes for tone-based humour, so this is not as much of a problem as it would be for a show that was specifically focused on gags. But it repeatedly uses anticlimaxes as the source of its humour, and while there is plenty of variation in the execution of them, it can still feel like the same thing over and over, and this may be a dealbreaker for some people.
At the end of the day, though, One Punch Man delivers a unique brand of comedy, and is extremely well-presented. Even at its worst point, it's an average action series, and it's best, it's a fantastic farcical comedy.
Final Words: Not actually the greatest thing ever made. Still well worth watching.

                “Saitama”, I guess that name often heard by all of the anime fans out there including me this lately. Well, that makes sense because this anime One Punch Man that adapted from a manga remake by Yusuke Murata and originally written by ONE has caught a large attention through it series. As most people knew, there’s pro and contra that shows up among anime fans out there about this show and because of that, I feel that I have to watch this no matter what. And now I finally did it so I’m gonna present this review of me for this anime. For more 20
                  minutes in each episode, you will find an extraordinary action and superhero stuff with a little bit parody that makes you stay and watch this anime till your jaw drops. Well, if anyone ask me how good it could be, then I can tell you that this anime is worth to watch especially to all of you who like an enjoyable anime filled with the surprising act.
(SPOILER ALERT)
(*) Story
There’s an incredibly powerful hero lives in the city, so powerful till he can easily defeat his enemies with a single punch. Well, most people will probably think, “that is sooo boring!”. But, don’t you ever think like that, my friend! Why? Let me tell you about it. There’s some beneficial things that the story section have in this anime (besides the character section). First, the story itself. I mean, the main story is so simple like I bet that many people from around the world have probably thought the same main idea just like this anime have. So simple till no one will ever tire to watch this anime from the very beginning till the end. The title suits the story, and that wasn’t made to overwhelm the power that the main character have but to making it more unique than the other anime that already exist out there. Second, the action setting. The story takes place in Japanese metropolis city which is great. Because that is a number one story background in a suggestion that will get epic when there’s some unstoppable character with massive power like heroes count in it. The violence, the destruction and the instant of falling objects that will make the audience’s jaw drops over and over again when they watch it. The actions itself are superb too. Believe me, even though this is a superhero anime, doesn’t mean that it's saved for children to watch it. I mean, you’ll find a lot of blood splashing too in it. This make sense because the seinen demographic that the manga remake have. And the last but not least benefit of the story is the parody. Actually, “parody” is one of the genre that hard to adapt for several reasons but the writer making it so natural and easy to received. You’ll meet many characters which you found familiar from other anime characters that show up in this anime. I guess the writer just want to represent all of the heroes anime in his creation and making it resemble with each of character in the story. But, again.. that’s a very wonderful idea cause it makes the audience not bored when some familiar yet remindful character pops up and makes a little comedy in it. The writer has changed this genre from hard to playful yet fun genre to watch. But, despite all above, the story itself still have some problem. For an example like the conflict of the story, the “existence” of it nearly gone. Probably because the main story (the super power stuff) consumed all of the episode and changes it to a next over-power level to shows up. It’s surely great, but.. I believe “conflict” is the section that has to exist in any stories. Luckily, the main character in the story brings himself to self-conflict in several episodes that explain who he really is. Like disrespectful that he received from others and he solved it just by several words. For the ending, it’s still an uncertain ending. I mean, there’s a lot of problems that they still need to solve or explain, like who Metal Knight really is, the past of Genos, the intention of Amai Mask, and many other problems. But besides that, the story still fun to watch. You will like the writer’s creativity for add the main character’s adventure with many various characters or like the association that made up and the surprising events that show up. I can say it filled with so much action and mind-blowing effect.   
(*) Art
The art was very good. It surely fits the story. You can feel the sensation of every move like you watch a real superhero. I bet the creators put all of their hard work in this section. And believe me, making an action anime with the unusual move or fighting-battle like that is not just as simple as you flip your hand. But, they have succeeded to bring an action to all of the episode which extremely stunning. Well, the creator did save energy to draw the main character, Saitama which I found simple to draw him just like an egg (no hurt feelings, it’s true) for several condition in the story but has managed to change his appearance to a serious one when he’s in an epic battle. But, that was good because with his unique appearance like that, he becomes the most memorable character and he “is” the main character after all. And don’t tell me about the animation, it’s really remarkable! Until now, I still remember the scene when Genos forced Saitama to train with him seriously, the art in that scene was sooo amazing and for the favorite was the final battle scene…. Believe me, it was more than “amazing”. No protest in this section.
(*) Sound
Okay, about the opening and ending…. hmm, well…. actually, those two are not really my favorite type of song but as long as they fit the story I guess that’s fair enough. I mean the opening was really “superheroic”, both the instrument and the lyrics. They have succeeded to symbolize One Punch Man to a song originally. And about the back sound was really epic! I really appreciate Makoto Miyazaki for his work on the music because it has nailed it to serves the audience like they watch a real superhero film. It just fits in with the classical music playing on and made a great symphony to rising the atmosphere of every scene. For the voice actor, Saitama’s role was voiced by Makoto Furukawa. He has made it describe Saitama’s personality like how passive he was sometimes or when he turns into serious-mode, his voice changed dramatically. And the other main character, Genos was voiced by Kaito Ishikawa. I think he has succeeded too. He made it to serves the audience about Genos’s personality who always curious about the secret power of Saitama even though he is a cyborg. And don’t forget about other’s voice actor like Aoi Yuki (Tornado), Yuki Kaji (Sonic), Yuichi Nakamura (Mumen Raider), Kenjiro Tsuda (Atomic Samurai), Minami Takayama (Child Emperor), Sakurai Takahiro (Zombieman), Mamoru Miyano (Amai Mask) and many other. Their name has been known by most anime fans for the popular role in other anime. And they weren't disappointed the audience in here either.
(*) Character
The character section still has some sort of problem. For an example like the fast introduction of the characters (besides the main characters). It just so fast till I realize I didn’t know who the heck he or she really is till their name was being told. Well, I guess that’s impact of how simple the story is, making it a little bit fast pace. And another example is about the sudden new character that shows up like when the Ocean King knocks the superheroes down in the shelter, there’s several character that suddenly appear which turns out to be a hero too (except Snake). And when I watch that I felt…. hmm, “oh-kaay so suddenly there’s another hero in the shelter that I really didn’t get a clue about who they are…” I admit it that I’m confused for a second but then Genos finally came to the shelter and my confusion out of focus, changed into curiosity about what will happen next after other superheroes got beaten. I guess that “misdirection” has only half-succeed. And for the last example, the development of the characters. I didn’t see any development in this story, there’s some self-conflict but it hasn't brought some kind of development to the main characters. But I guess that’s fine, compared to the amount of the episode of this anime. I think if the episode more than twelve, maybe they could fix this problem. Or probably the writer just want to tell the audience about the main story first before the developmental section, hmm, I don’t know. It all depends on the writer. But for me, I guess that to have a story like this it doesn’t enough for just twelve episodes. Well, they did make OVA’s after all, let’s just hope that the OVA’s give some kind of explanation, answer or repair those problems. But other than that, the character section did nail it for some reason. Like the design of the supporting characters, the illustrator has made the characters was easy to memorize because their unique appearance and the similarities to other anime’s character. Like Silverfang, I did found easy to memorize him because he really similar to Zeno Zoldyck from Hunter X Hunter. And he did found the easy way to introduce Saitama and Genos as the main character of the story with the differential appearance they have. I mean, Saitama’s appearance so simple (bold, bright costume with red gloves) different than Genos who has the complex appearance (blonde-pale yellow hair, armored costume, black long pants). It’s making them so easy to memorize plus with their story background, age info, and their personality. I bet many people too has become their fans for that reasons (besides “the popular” and “the badass” reason). That points explain why this two main character more loved by the audience rather than the other characters. Well, if you guys want to know more about the other characters (supporting), I think you should read the webtoon, the remake manga or just searching to find more. Because you’ll not get that in this anime. It’s full of action and the main character’s role.           
(*) Enjoyment
I enjoying it very much till the end. Although at the first episode, I’m not really into it but the story, the characters, and the sound were amazingly succeeded to draw both “enjoy” and “curiosity” to me. This anime was really fun to watch. You’re not gonna tired of watching each of episode, I bet there are a lot of anime fans out there that finished watching this anime just only one day or half-day because of it enjoyed. And it actually makes me re-watch this anime again from the very beginning. If you ask which section that satisfy me the most, then the answer is in this section. Because the hesitation to watch it from the start was totally gone as the story goes on and suddenly you just realize that you have watched till the last episode. Speak of the last episode, that was certainly an epic battle that you can found only in this anime. So, despite it lacks for some part as I mentioned above, you will not get bored to watch this and I can say that One Punch Man is highly recommended for all of the anime fans out there. Finally, for a suggestion, don’t mind about the pro and contra about this show, just watch it for yourself and the final score certainly depends on your taste of anime. Everyone has different taste and likes, good and bad are relative, you’re the one who decide it.",8,Akafection

                Every year there is at least one particular show that receives massive coverage for whatever reason.In 2015, without a question was One Punch Man's year in the spotlight and for good reason; the initial premise of One Punch seemed to be a goldmine, for it was thought to be a clever,satiristic view of the shonen and action anime that has been dominate since the last decade. 
So then, with roses thrown before the curtain is raised, does One Punch Man live up to its potential ? Without even a sigh, no would be the answer. 
The biggest flaws that Opm suffers from are the counter
                  productive characterizations, and repetitive wall paint humor gags. 
The show's content is mainly derived from Saitama and Genos fighting new villains each episodes which is axiomatically plain itself , so the show has to induce humor to make things interesting but fails to do so because the show keeps using the same joke over and over again . Speaking of Saitama and Genos, Saitama is arguably the weaker of the two because his apathetic nature makes him too static for the audience to actually care about him;Thankfully, Genos proves to be a better character because of the mystery and passion floating in his background;However, and ironically so, the most enjoyable character was one of the other heroes, Tornado; her Asuka-esque attitude and powers made her a much more attractive personality, yet we never got much from her. The action that does take place is rather vivid in fluid , thus, making the show enjoyable in that respect; the animation is nice polished as well. 
At the end of the day, One Punch Man fails to do many things right but not in the extreme sense.While, It is shame that it could fulfill its potential at least it's watchable and could be considered entertaining if nothing else is on.",5,AndrewVeloz

                One Punch Man was a fairly popular anime from the tail end of last year. It was based off of a webcomic by One, which has also been adapted into a manga. The anime came from Madhouse, which could be good or bad and there's no real way to ascertain which it is just because it has a lot of fans. After all, some of the worst anime I've seen have had pretty substantive fan bases. Then again, just last week I reviewed Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig, which was both popular and really good. So, let's take a look and
                  I'll see if it lives up to the hype.
Story:
Saitama is a hero for fun. When major trouble threatens people, he shows up and dispatches the threat with a single punch. There's just one problem, he's so strong that it's all become rather boring for him. The series follows Saitama as he faces various menaces, the most threatening of which is his own melancholy.
Honestly, the biggest flaw with the comedy of the series is that it gets repetitive pretty quickly. Most of it follows the same pattern. A menace shows up, gets built up as a grave and pressing threat, fighting against and beating other heroes, Saitama shows up and one shots it. In between fights we get some other jokes, a lot of which are about Saitama being bored and disinterested with what he's doing. Then we have a character who exists entirely as an unfunny gay stereotype, Puripuri Prisoner. Thankfully, he's a minor character and only shows up in a few episodes but his scenes can be pretty cringe-worthy.
On the positive side, the main repeated joke of the series can be funny a few times and there are some pretty amusing scenes betwixt the action sequences. Some of which are actually quite clever in the ways they tackle shounen action series tropes.
Characters:
Most of the characters in One Punch Man are pretty stock action tropes with a comedic twist. They aren't particularly complex but most of them are perfectly good for a parody work. I actually do quite like the contrasting dynamic with Saitama's more jaded and frivolous outlook with Genos' more youthful and serious outlook. The best moments in the series come from these two playing off of one another. There are other characters with potential but, due to the short length of the series, a lot of them end up getting used for a single joke and don't really get any interactions or dynamics to play off of their potential.
Art:
The artwork and animation are both really good in this series. The action sequences, at least before Saitama shows up, can be really interesting to see, even though you know how they're going to end. There are also some really nice and detailed villain designs in this. The one major flaw is that the action scenes get boring and repetitive when Saitama is involved. They either end really quickly or he lets the villain knock him around for a bit without any concern before ending it.
Sound:
The voice acting is okay. There are some strong actors in this and they give perfectly passable performances. They're just not particularly good or memorable. The music is pretty standard. It's not bad nor is it good. It's just functional.
Ho-yay:
Aside from our stereotype running around and frightening guys he finds attractive, there isn't any. So, this is a series that would be better with less ho-yay.
Final Thoughts:
When it comes right down to it, whether or not One Punch Man is going to work for you really depends on whether or not you're the type of person who can keep laughing at the same joke, even when you know it's coming. If you can see slightly different versions of the same joke and keep laughing, this one may have the punch for your funny bone. If, on the other hand, you're a person who needs humour to be surprising in order to get a laugh out of it, you should definitely skip it. If you're like me and you can gain amusement from the same joke under certain circumstances but you need time between the versions, I would recommend seeing it, but giving it around ten days between episodes so that it doesn't get overly repetitive for you. In the end, in spite of its short comings, it's a decent parody series. I give it a 6/10. Next week, I'm looking at Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna: Shin'en no Fairy.",6,ktulu007

                One Punch Man is a highly accurate parody of the shonen and superhero genres. It mimics them with stunning precision.
Overpowered protagonist? Check. 
Like Superman on steroids. One! Punch!
No plot worth mentioning? Check. 
The overall plot is uneventful to say the least, and the show is mostly episodic. Even within each episode there is little meaningful moral conflict or development. It's good vs evil for the blandest reasons, and none of it matters in the long run. There are plenty of fight scenes though.
Bland throwaway characters? Check. 
Most of the cast is a collection of one-shot nobodies with barely any screentime. The villains are a revolving
                  door of bland bad guys ready to get punched to pieces. The heroes get maybe a few minutes if they are lucky. The motives of the characters are so generic that when they are holding their usual speeches even the protagonist Saitama is disinterested. The few recurring characters don't fare much better. Saitama was actually bored of his own sidekick's backstory.
Limited joke repertoire? Check. 
One! Punch!
Actually, that's not quite fair. There are a few other ones:
- The Hero Association is a bunch of faceless bureaucrats who do more sitting in meetings than helping people.
- The repetitive nature of the show is itself a joke. Just make sure you're sitting comfortably because it's a long one.
Mindnumbingly repetitive? Check. 
Once you have figured out the formula, expect more of the same:
1. Random villain of the week appears and explains his backstory. Evilutionary scientist, alien overlord, king of the lizard people, whatever.
2. Saitama's sidekick Genos or some other heroes get thrown around.
3. Saitama appears and there's a punch.
4. Tune in next week. Same bat-time, same bat-channel.
Too many episodes for the plot? Check... somewhat.
But to fully parodize this there should have been at least a hundred. Future seasons may be able to fix this. All aboard the hype train.
So all is well, then? Well, yes, if you don't mind ending up as bored as Saitama himself. One Punch Man has taken mimicry to the point where it suffers from the same tedium as its targets. From fight scene to fight scene, from generic villain to generic villain, it has captured the formulaic nature of shonen and superhero shows and become just as formulaic.
The show accurately portrays how Saitama's existential angst and disillusionment with society have turned into apathy, and it inspires the same in the viewer. After a while, watching this show starts feeling meaningless.",3,TheDeedsOfMen

                I only feel that you can review content after you have completed it, and with this being my first review i did not want make that mistake (especially after that excellent finale) 
(SKIP TO OVERALL IF YOU DONT LIKE LONG READS)
One Punch Man is a parody so it obviously  has a decent focus on comedy and quips to keep some gears running whist you are watching, but don't let that put you off as the series has amazing fight sequences with outstanding animation, when the general thought would be ""How can this series have good fights if the main dude is OP"". I will
                  admit, i came to ""ONE PUUUUNCCCHHH"" as very stubborn, sceptical individual, as im that type of hipster that attempts not to follow the hype, however i gave this series a chance and it met my expectations and more in all its areas. 
Story(8/10) - A CLASS Satisfied)
Call the plot simple, because it really is SIMPLE; just like the main protagonists face & look, the series SCREAMS SIMPLE. But being simple does not make this series bad because it understands this fact & benifits from it , as the world is very dense but is created from such a simple concept that it makes the series that much more interesting but easy to understand and enjoy. 
Although from the side plots & comments about sinister/absent characters, i feel that the plot is building to a more intense & serious place for the  future ( i have not read the manga) .
Art(10/10 - 9/10)
Im not here to debate about the pay for artists & animators, as the topic is for a different time, but with this series having a near average budget for a 12 episode run just baffles me. 
Not one corner was cut to keep the feel & beauty of this series running consistently, as the attention to detail in scenes makes the world created One come to life, as visually - every character has something to offer in looking aesthetically pleasing for viewers (even Saitama) , so much love was put into it.
THE FIGHT SCENES ARE JUST EPIC IN ANIMATION!
But being critical, the worlds strongest mans fight animation was not on par with the others - yet it did kinda have its own lankey charm aha)
Sound(10/10 ONE PUNCCCCHHHHHH)
Okay, if you don't like epic music & a tense soundtrack to keep you on the edge of your seat... you wont like this Soundtrack. However i think everyone can appreciate how the music direction suits the series to make the experience whole.
THANK GOD this series did not use a ""Silly song"" to play whenever the characters are up to their comedic antics, as the use of pause and silence in the sound makes the experience even funnier in moments.
Character(10/10 Mumen Rider!!) 
The characters in this series have a lot to offer, as each is unique in the One Punch Man universe to create a dynamic yet interesting world. Now this is not saying that you will not feel some characters are being generic or similar to others created in anime or any other media , but OPM actually plays on this trope.
Also OPM actually has some emotional & serious scenes with a bunch of its characters, that most viewers (especially myself) can empathise with.
Enjoyment(10/10 I clapped when the finale ended)
I actually never reviewed an anime online, but i really just enjoyed this series so much that i needed to share my views of it to the internet( so that others could experience what i did)
Just complete the series and give it a chance, and for a long time anime viewer this series is perfect to kickstart faith in new original anime.
OVERALL( 10/10) 
After originally being sceptical about One Punch Man, I actually had this series set in my mind as a 8/9 out of 10; But after the finale and such a satisfying run, the series is a complete 10 ""Masterpiece"" of its own.
ALTHOUGH, do not take a rating of 10 to say that this anime is ""better"" or ""cooler"" than others( which i may of rated lower), i just believe, in itself this series gives everything and more to expect in its genre; in a smart fashion that leaves me extremely satisfied with ""that""12 episode run being complete product filled with love at every corner.

                Although one of the most influential and important superheroes of all time, Superman kind of sucks as a character. He has a bland personality. He's OP as fuck and defeats virtually any threats with little difficulty. He is a moral paragon and for over 80 years has fought for good and punished evil in a Manichean and childish style. This offers his character very little in terms of internal conflict or psychological development. He has no weaknesses to overcome, no need to improve, and never faces challenges that make the reader feel worried that he could possibly lose. Even IF he somehow loses once every
                  40 years, the writers will create some fucking bullshit like a ""healing coma"" to explain that he didn't really lose.
What if you took a HUGE animation budget and gave it to an anime almost solely devoted to bashing Superman? You would get One Punch Man! If you are a true weaboo and have no familiarity with American comics like Superman...just imagine if Inferno Cop had a lovechild with Dr. Slump and that child had an ungodly high production budget. That's basically what this is.
Plot:
The eponymous One Punch Man is an incredibly lame and OP costumed hero who effortlessly defeats random opponents on a daily basis. These fights almost always result in absurdly high casualties and destruction, but this is just hand-waved and forgotten, much like the movie Man of Steel. One Punch Man is quickly joined by a spoof of Iron Man and fights a spoof of The Rhino from Spiderman, who randomly transforms into Eva Unit 1 for...reasons. This is all in just the first few episodes! OPM even jumps the shark by episode 3 or 4 and references the MUDA MUDA MUDA meme from JoJo. I just pray they have the restraint to NOT make a John Cena joke! OPM basically has no plot, but when you are a spoof series that doesn't take itself seriously, you really don't need a plot. Did Apocalypse Zero have a plot? No. It just made fun of Hokuto no Ken, Super Sentai, and Kamen Rider. That's it!
Humor:
I mentioned previously that OPM has a lot of superhero spoofing and geek referential humor, but that doesn't really capture the full picture. OPM has that style of REALLY stupid and immature humor that is entirely self-aware and revels in its own stupidity. I mentioned earlier the likes of Inferno Cop and Dr. Slump, which you should definitely check out if you enjoyed OPM. However, OPM has its own distinct tastes. It isn't quite as stoner centered in its comedy as Inferno Cop, which basically just wanted to be the anime version of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. While OPM shares its 4th wall breaking, playful stupidity, and even its strong hatred of Superman with Dr. Slump, it isn't as pun filled and there isn't as much sex humor. This is a somewhat unique brand of stupidity that you simply have to assess for yourself.
Art: 
What is the main thing that makes One Punch Man different from all the other shows I've compared it to? One Punch Man is animated by Studio Madhouse and they are actually using their full efforts to make this silly spoof as aesthetically pleasing as possible! The animation is fluid, the character models look funny, the blood is heavily stylized, yet done in a way that instantly invokes laughter. Visually, OPM is actually pretty damn good!
Overall:
OPM is the most hyped anime of this year by FAR. Is it actually as good as everyone is saying? No it isn't, but at least it IS pretty funny and enjoyable. Considering the hype train was fueled by the same anime threads that backed the likes of Nichijou and Food Wars, this was actually above expectations. I can say I honestly laughed quite a few times and enjoyed myself. By some miracle, this isn't one of the plethora of absurdly overhyped anime out there with a fandom of hipster douchebags who like it ""ironically"". I'm looking at you Stardust Crusaders! If you haven't seen One Punch Man, I would definitely recommend checking it out!",7,literaturenerd

                I have to admit OPM is not like a regular shounen anime where the 
villain beats the crap out of mc and all of his friends start crying 
to save them and the mc turns super saiyan 5 or 6 and then beats the 
heck out of the villain.
But guess what.. OPM still sucks and terribly.
I tend to keep my reviews short but i found the need to enlighten this 
world about why OPM sucks so i decided to give a detailed review based 
on 12 episodes of the anime.
I tried my best to make this review spoiler free.
Story: 1/10
In a sentence ""An extremely overpowered guy who knocks out douches 
with one punch"" sounds legit.Comedy is supposed be the main objective 
of this anime but imo their attempts at comedy were pathetic.I fail to 
understand how naming people or rather creatures Vaccine 
Man,Beefcake,Smile Man,License-less Rider,Atomic Samurai,Pig God are 
supposed to make us laugh.There were a few moments where i had a faint 
grin but they got overshadowed by the stupidity of the mc.
Art: 8/10
The best part of this anime is the art.Ofcourse the art would be 
amazing because it is made by Madhouse.Also this is the only reason 
why i decided to watch this anime.
I cant believe i am appreciating OPM but i have to say this as guys, 
the minute details in the surroundings were actually impressive.Also 
the animation in the last episode was good.The character design of 
lord Boros was epic.
Sound: 4/10
There was this one guy in our college who kept annoying me by singing 
some random anime opening and turns out that it was OPM's opening.He 
also told me that the soundtracks were amazing and give the vibe of a 
Godlike badass.After listening to soundtracks especially Saitama,s 
main theme instead of screaming ""ONE PUUUUUNCH MAAAAN"" i yelled ""WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY""
Character: -1/10
I read this description of Saitama on the OPM wiki which was
""In this new action-comedy, everything about a young man named Saitama 
screams ""AVERAGE,"" from his lifeless expression, to his bald head, to 
his seemingly unimpressive physique. However, this average-looking 
fellow doesn't have your average problem... He's actually a superhero 
that's looking for tough opponents! The problem is, every time he 
finds a promising candidate he beats the snot out of them in one 
punch. Can Saitama finally find an evil villain strong enough to 
challenge him? Follow Saitama through his hilarious romps as he 
searches for new bad guys to challenge!""
So the strongest guy huh.. then nothing to watch here.This is a failed 
attempt at parody.I cannot comprehend how they show <SPOILER>his ass 
getting kicked by Boros,suddenly starts retaliating and finally Boros 
agrees that he was no match to Saitama.So this is just another shounen 
anime without all the friendship drama although it doesnt have that 
tag.
Enjoyment: 0/10
I wasted 17280 seconds of my precious life on this disgusting piece of 
crap.I should be on tons of meth to give OPM a score of 0 out of 10.
Overall: 1/10
The only reason i gave it 1 is because of Madhouse.Guys trust me i had 
to do a reality check twice after i finished this anime about why 
people liked this so much.I began doubting whether i was living in the 
normal world or i was living in the parallel universe where anime like 
perfect insider and one outs barely manage to get an 8.5 but this shit 
gets a score around 9.
Please donot watch this even if people recommend this anime as it would be a sheer waste of time.

                *Message to everybody who saw my score and was like""What an idiot"", ""Is this guy serious"", ""This man clearly has no taste in anime"", ""Uncultured Swine"". Keep in mind EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN OPINION*
This is my first and probably my last anime review, but I write this with the purpose being so that I don't forget the reason why I didn't really like this anime which puts me into the minority of people who have watched it. So in turn, I won't give you a real review with a story, art, sound, etc. numerical value breakdown but just a semi-short breakdown of
                  the show as a whole. I also have NO PROBLEM with the character being completely over powered and that this is an end game shounen... just putting that out there.

=====
Madhouse does it again with their Art and Sound...
BAD
====
     Overall, I can't see what makes this show a 10/10 to other people, but everybody is entitled to their own opinion. I believe that the major problem I have with the show is that it is episodic. There was very little plot to start with and on top of that I started to realize that there would be no plot advancement due to the show being episodic. If that's the case than why don't I just go watch modern day television. I myself enjoy shows with a great story and overall character development which I just think this show lacks in general. I mean did Saitama really gain his superpowers that way...really? Where are all these super villains coming from? How did they get their powers? How did the Heroes get their powers? How did the Hero Association come to exist? Will at least some of the extensive amount of questions I have ever really be answered? Find out on the next episode of One Punch Man... Oh wait I guess we won't will we? Oh yeah.. Episodic, I forgot... sigh.... but I regress.
     There is also the problem I have with the characters. This show is also what I believe to be a solely comedic anime, hence the characters look, feel, act, and just how dense they can be, but like I said that's probably due to this being a comedy. Another reason for my dislike would be the that I find the Comedy of it to be really dry and unsavory, but that's my own sense of humor. If others find that sort of comedy amusing, than I can see why. This show also takes 5-6 episodes in my opinion to pick up and even start showing signs of a potential story(The story pickup in my eyes by the way is the introduction of the Hero Association). That's almost HALF the show. 
Overall
======
After finishing the show, It has definitely come to grow on me.... at least a little. I also do believe that their should be a second season of One Punch Man and i'm sure there will be due to its immense popularity. But I only say this in the hopes that the second season will be where the actual story lies.
     Hopefully the people who read this can see my reasoning behind this and not just write me off as an Anime Pleeb. Thanks for reading!",5,BleachedStrawhat

                It's an absolute embarrassment how highly this show is rated in the Anime community, over many long running and sophisticated animes that took effort to write and sent emotions running high and low. I feel like this rating is driven purely by emotion from people who enjoy the eccentricity of a self-aware anime. To be fair, that is a very comedic aspect and is worth some points. However, this anime was never meant to be serious and has been drastically overrated for the aforementioned reason. The storyline is very shallow and it seems like it was put together on the spot as you continue through
                  episodes. It becomes very dreadful to watch only a few episodes in and the focus turns away from Saitama. Saitama has a very unique personality, and his apprentice has a satirical unfitting one. But characters fade in and out of the show quickly, with no real connections being made between the watcher and other characters. Also, the comedy is very one-dimensional for a series based on comedy. It focuses solely on exaggerations and comic relief. The art is arguably very creative for people who don't mind the styles switching once and a while, and that was a plus for me. It actually adds to it's eccentricity. Anyway, in conclusion, I'd give it somewhere between a 3 and a 4.",3,primaski

                Okay... One Punch Man is a weird show to describe my thoughts on it, but I will try my best.
This show started out actually fairly mediocre for me, it never hooked me right off the bat, and didn't hook me until around the Sea King arc. But even tho it did hook me really late in the game, it still never sold me on it being a show worth watching again, or even recommending to someone else. But just as each episode went by I found myself enjoying it more and more.
Art/Animation) it looks solid, tho I'm the type of person who would rather take
                  a more realistic type animation style such as Nagi no Asukara/Kara no Kyoukai/Garden of Words. But it still works for the show, it isn't ""the best animation I've ever seen"" like how some people say it is, but you can clearly tell how much effort the animators loved working on this project.
Music) The OST is fantastic and wish that I could have it immediately but sadly we aren't getting it until the middle of January. As for the ED, I felt as it is was really lacking, it was slow and forgettable. But for the OP... man, at first I hated the song, but over time it began to grow on me even tho it still isn't the best opening of the season... but short answer, I really enjoy it.
Comedy) It was really hit and miss for me, some of the witty dialogue just didn't get to me. But the one thing that i found the most hilarious about this whole show was where in the very beginning of the whole show when Genos first met saitama and started asking him a lot of questions and just continuously speaking faster and faster until saitama snaps and yells ""Enough you idiot! Shorten it to 20 words or less!!!"".
Story) I found it to be lackluster at first, just being the same shit after each episode: terror in city by some strange monster, saitama shows up, the monsters make fun of him, saitama throws one single punch and the match is over. But over time you were introduced to the hero system, and each class rank. And you met more and more bad guys, then talked about the danger system and other stuff. Tho the plot is super basic, i feel as if just keeps going and might never have a definitive end until Saitama decides to retire and hang up his suit forever.
Characters) As I explained earlier about the hero system and the ranks and stuff, this is where I believe how the writer simply used this as a ploy in my opinion to shoehorn in other ""heroes"" just for the sake of them being there and having witty dialogue. But the thing is, the show introduced like 10 or more different characters in the last few episodes and we never learn anything about them until the end of the show. But I will say this, they all have very unique and interesting (sometimes) character design and powers.
My thoughts on the last episode were it was fun and good, and left me wanting more... but the thing is, there isn't more. So I'm really perplexed about this ""ending"" for say, because I know that the manga keeps going, but i feel as if the anime just ended and didn't have any closer for this series. So I really hope to see a season 2 to this series, because I just want to learn more about this world/characters while also seeing how the ""story"" progresses.
In the long run, I can wholeheartedly say that I would recommend this series to other anime fans to watch... but for all the people saying it is the ""savior of anime""... well it isn't so deal with it, and it isn't even the best show to air this season. Anyways, I would give this series an 8/10.",8,MagnitudeReviews

                Now I know that the story overall isn´t very deep or well thought through, but several people (idiots I like to call them) seem to give the anime bad ratings based on that, eventhough the obvious goal of the anime is to have people enjoy it. The hype around the series is well deserved and understandable. The author of the series simply made a good choice story and plotwise and Madhouse turned his manga into one hell of an amazing anime. The art, animation, scenery, cutsequence, sound and so on were amazingly well done.
Animation: 10/10
Very solid, but even amazingly detailed animation, as well as incredible
                  portrayage of physics (the action in the series is very physics-heavy).
Unique character looks and good effects. Nice pause sequence.
Story: 7/10
Of course the story isn´t the best part about the anime, however it is quite intriguing, e.g. the whole story around saitama and his social standing is well done in my opinion.
Sound: 10/10
Madhouse did an amazing job on soundtracks, the theme song, character voices and SFX as they tend to. The theme song is catchy and the soundtracks create a perfect atmosphere for whatever is currently displayed.
Character: 10/10
The characters in One Punch Man are what I really liked in the series. There´s quite a large cast with interesting, funny and likeable people AND creatures.
Enjoyment: 10/10
The overwhelming sensation that I had during the entire series: Joy. All put-together the anime features great comedy which made me laugh out loud several times. The amount of power or ""overpoweredness"" of saitama also made my jaw drop basically every episode, giving me goosebumps and making me laugh or squeal. The action is, as I already said, very well displayed.
Overall opinion: 10/10
I give this series 10 out of 10 points, because I simply enjoyed it beyond belief. It´s fresh and has a very unique feel to it, stunning you every episode.",10,Relaxel

                Ok so it's time to give OPM what it deserve. The show was promising and fun to watch at the begining but at the end of the last episode, I had only one word in my head : flat. The story is flat, the background is flat, the characters are flat, tatsumaki is flat and so is Saitama's face. At least there are a good match. It was disappointing. ""What I am watching ? Even Bleach and Fairy Tail have better characters and storyline"" and oh god I really hate Fairy Tail. 
The concept was fine, but one shot everyone is really boring if you
                  don't show something else. So let me guess what will happen next ? A new villain will appear, Genos will get destroyed, then X randoms heros will get beatten too and Saitama will do the job and Mumen Rider will get the credits.  Such suspense, much originality, very surprised WoW. Doge approuves.
Madhouse saved a part of the show thanks to a very good animation, but once again I was disappointed by Saitama's fight. I had very high expectations since the show can only provides fighs, and once again it was average. The fights are just empty and even the last one was lame. Saitaima get punched again and again taking the hits like it was nothing, just lost in though.... ""Oh Gosh hit him already !"" Then Saitama wakes-up to blow the guy in one hit. ""Okay guys we need a new fight idea"" 1) ""Make more stupid ennemies"" 2) ""Saitama wins in two punchs"" 3) ""what about something that balance the fights ?"" ... Get the meme reference ?
So OPM looks like Bleach with poor dialogues, poor storyline, no characters developpement and so on. You cloud say ""OPM only has 12 episodes"". It's true. But even in 12 épisodes a show needs to bring some background / storyline to be better than just a chain of stupid fights. In this regards, OPM failed. We can say that OPM is a blockbuster and easily enjoyable but don't expect too much.
And obviously, I didn't find it funny at all.  
In the end, even Bleach is way better as a Bankai is more impressive than a one punch man.",5,kruzluk

                A simple webcomic with sloppy drawing and started out as a hobby, re-drawn by a god-tier manga artist, and now it has an anime adaptation which is now the most Popular Anime of the Decade. This Anime exceeds the expectation of the many which makes this anime incredible especially for its fight scenes, but for now, it has ended and we have to wait for more than a year in order for this anime to have a sequel, since the source material still lacks for it to be animated.
Anime vs. Manga vs. Webcomic
Now I just want to tell people that I’ve read the Manga version
                  and the Webcomic before this anime was announced, it was March at that time, going back to its comparison the Anime is no doubt the best of the three, since it’s the final package of adaptation, but it doesn’t mean the Manga can be ignored that has breathtaking art almost comparable to its anime, as for the Webcomic, which is the origin of the series, excels in plot and character development, the crème of OPM series which lacks on the anime. The Webcomic has already finished its top notch arc, the Garou Arc, but the manga is still preparing for that arc which is the most incredible plot with great character development with balanced fights of OPM series, though I don’t want to talk about it since it will be a spoiler and it’s not yet re-drawn.
It is indeed unique, unlike any shounen premise which has a basic formula of “Fight and Train until you get stronger” nor the western style of “Super” w/ a story of fighting for humanity. OPM utilizes itself for its “Gag Purposes” that destroys the common principle styles and logic which is always used on many shows and series and which destroys what was set in the common mentality. The story is incomplete that leaves me unsatisfied, the story in the Webcomic is yet to come and the manga has uncovered many characters which makes it fun to read, but the anime is still on its introduction, more likely, it has covered up its awesomeness of its theme, and after that, is quite underwhelming, but It doesn’t mean I didn’t like it, but rather, it is really predictable when it comes to plot device, we already know who’s going to win, so basically we already know what’s going to happen and we’re just waiting for to see the results, the reaction and the scale of the fight. It needs a sequel to appreciate this anime completely, and because of that I encourage people to read the Manga at Chapter 37, and if you’re into plot, just finish the ongoing manga and read the Webcomic version at Chapter 51.
Aesthetic sound and Visually Outstanding, when it comes to its Output, everything is just awesome, no doubt that this is one of the best anime when it comes to Art and Sound, it’s really good that even reading the manga the anime had exceed my expectation, the only problem when it comes to animation was the “Impact Factor” the manga did it, every small detail of art nor the casual and funny scenes is just artistically outstanding, well the manga has the best dedicated manga artist who dedicated his life into it, going back to the anime, the art of the anime is good, but sometimes it becomes mediocre then it goes to fight scenes, the show cuts loose with evocative smears, spinning cameras, and wild linework combined with great guitar solo and memorable music which brings the fights into life, so it’s like a switch, it’s like an “on and off” concept which makes the anime sometimes underwhelming, especially after overwhelming fights which heightens the tension of the anime scene. The Last episode is the very evidence of it, the first half was just awesome, then the second half is quite underwhelming.
What made me love this anime was the Sound, it’s the best, I wish I can copy the guitar solos through hearing, but for now, I want to point out that this Anime has a magnificent anime Opening, which didn’t spoil any audiences and have created a story while showing how cool Saitama is, and the Background music which livens everything especially when it comes to its fighting scenes, the only thing that I hate was the Ending[ed] especially the memorable alarm clock with a sad song to end its awesomeness of each episode.   
Now for the characters, the highlights of the whole series, they are just memorable, they’ve got unique appeal and their character designs fit their very image. There’s a simple symbolism for Saitama and Genos, they are liken to Yin[white and Yang[black] that balances them in this series. Though Saitama’s Highlights would fall to episode 7 and 9, I don’t want to talk about since it will be a spoiler for those who didn’t watch the anime. OPM’s supporting characters makes this story, they are appealing and they are awesome, but only few of them have developed and the others were just shown just to show their scale of power to win the fight, to observe, or to lose the fight. The antagonist are very clichéd, there’s nothing bad to them nor good points, they are just there to show the scale of power of different level and to be defeated by mc, fortunately some heroes were given a time to show off their skills. There might be flaws when it comes to plot character device, but there are some hidden ethics and logic in this anime, and there’s more in the its manga and webcomic.
Now most of the viewers have enjoyed this anime, while some have loathed it since its too overrated, but for me, it’s really good, the fighting scenes was good, one of the best executed anime, it’s jaw dropping and the visually stunning with great combination of impressive sound, the characters are really unique that many people have been captivated into them. Many have created thousands of arts, have been cosplayed by many audiences, many have become bald just to do that, and many who are new to anime have watched this and most of all, it’s heavily known throughout the world, it’s just popular that it has conquered social meds, forums and more. It’s funny(not sure why some people doesn’t find it funny) and sometimes it touches the audiences, but most of the time, it’s awesome.
It’s worth to watch, it’s an all ages anime[but it’s R - 17+ (violence & profanity)] it’s really good to recommend it to new to anime, but the anime is still incomplete, it needs a sequel in order to bring out its full potential, it’s still lacks since it has covered only the first half of the whole series, while the best quality of this series exist in its manga and webcomic. 
The anime is really good and no doubt enjoyable, the people behind it made it really good, and the funny thing is, people were inspired by Saitama’s Training Regimen that many NEETS, Otakus and many more have worked out that a joke turned into motivation. I want to recommend this as an action comedy, highly recommended for new to anime viewers and casual viewers.",6,VanAlex

                I don't normally look at this site's review average before watching an anime, but OnePunch Man getting a 9.02 is worthy of a few eyebrows. Naturally my curiosity piqued and I started watching it. Is it enjoyable? Yeah maybe. Is it worthy of a 9/10. No, most definitely not.
OnePunch Man as an anime set itself out to be a parody of shounen hero animes. As in, it sets itself out to be different than your typical shounen show (hah pun laugh dammit). The concept itself (and by extension the first episode) is a good representation of that, Saitama is portrayed as a boring invincible hero
                  and uses very normal offense and defense moves instead of standard flashy attacks and doesn't announce his moves. In fact, the first episode alone makes for  very good episode, but a gimmicky one at that that doesn't lend itself to be extended into a series.
The problem with OnePunch Man is that, with a character so absurdly powerful such that all battles end with one punch, action scenes lose their tension and therefore become dull. The first episode played on this joke well enough, but when the following episodes start doing it, you really start to lose interest in the fight scenes. Most people recommending me this series told me that the series is mostly comedy, not action. Those people are dirty filthy liars. OnePunch Man should NOT have been done as an action series primarily, and should have been a comedy series first and foremost with fights serving as prelude or outcome of a gag and not the crux of the episodes. 
Most action scenes either involve Genos or the other loser heroes from the Hero Association. The thing is, once the episode starts focusing on them (they do towards the 2nd half with the introduction of the Sea King arc and the Boros arc) instead of Saitama, then OnePunch Man starts to lose its identity ; it just ends up delving into generic shounen action anime while the heroes get jobbed and wait for Saitama to finish the monsters off. Also none of the heroes ever get into a life-threatening situation where any tension or drama can be felt, instead after you see that one guy survive the so-called lethal blow by the Sea King in episode 7 or so, you know for sure none of the heroes are gonna be facing any situation that may put their lives in peril. This severely diminishes any effect the fight may otherwise have.
Even the comedy scenes, few as they are, aren't that special or anything. It's fairly hit and miss, and most of the best scenes are in the first few episodes. The one memorable comedic moment I can remember from the anime (outside the OP where he punches the star man) is from the last episode where Saitama asked for directions out of the spaceship only to go in the opposite direction, grinning like a maniac, to fight the bad guys. Scenes like this are surprisingly rare for a comedy series, scenes that work so well and have perfect comedic timing aren't easy to find. Most of the jokes generally involve Saitama's superhuman strength despite his very average appearance/fighting style and they wear off really quickly.
The plot itself is alright, I wasn't expecting much out of a series that set itself to be a parody of the shounen genre, but I really didn't like how they handled the exposition scenes. Often characters just break and go on rambling on and on. Occasionally Saitama butts in and tells them to can it, but only very late after almost the entire expository scene is done. The central theme in which a true hero is not necessarily a highly-ranked one, or one associated with some form of bureaucracy isn't conveyed well. In the sense that Genos, Saitama and Momen Rider are obviously people the show wants you to root for while everyone else is either a jerk or a perv or comically evil but still part of the Hero Association for one reason or another. They are very one-dimensional and given how many characters there are, you hardly get to have any screentime with some of the Class S heroes even. Characters like Tatsumaki and Sweet Mask make like a cameo at best and what's worse is that their importance is only teased at the very end of the series. If the anime doesn't get a continuation (very unlikely), that means essentially this whole series is one big product placement for the manga series, like most manga-to-anime adaptations.
In conclusion, despite its many flaws, OnePunch Man is still very much watchable. Just don't go in expecting anything spectacular. Like its titular character,  Saitama, OnePunch Man is ultimately very average.

                And now presenting; Puddin’s First Review! 
I know a little something about superheroes, ladies and gents, and I know a little something about comedy. One Punch Man gets a looooot of love for, apparently, “doing both of these things so well,” so obviously a natural Joker like moi, was obviously going to be drawn to this after having read all of Les Mis in one sitting and had a craving for something a bit less heavy handed. Something that could make me laugh that isn’t my own jokes for once, you know? 
But this, this is NOT what I expected, nor what I consider a
                  “Pioneer of Parody.” Folks, telling the same joke more than once, let alone OVER and OVER again kills it. KILLS IT. It takes a crowbar right to the gut and yanks, gnashes, tears it to shreds, until there is nothing more but a pile of viscera and doggy dinner scraps sopping wet in cold, ripe blood. Does that sound very appetizing to you? DOES IT? Because to me, The Clown Prince of Crime himself, that sounds deliberately disdainful. In fact, telling a joke more than once is quite similar to explaining the joke. And if you have to explain a joke, then there is no joke!
And all of the heroes in this show? RIPOFFS! A man who can defeat anything in one punch, wears a cape, flies around, and is BALD? Excuse me, but you seem to have mish-mashed good ol’ Lexy and Supes into some horrid catastrophe of a character, and labeled him some contrived “Hero” wearing something only that total HACK Ronald McDonald would put on willingly. And people think “Satanma” or whatever his Wapanese name may be, is a hero? Must I describe to you what a hero is? I certainly hope not, there seems to be loads of them running around nowadays, you’d know it if you saw it, all it takes is some fraud wearing colorful underwear over their pants and BOOM! You have yourself a hero, listeners, and they don’t even need to have powers. Take Bat Brain and his boy-toy sidekicks of his. 
And what just really hurts me inside is that they didn’t even have the decency to rip him off like all the rest- the best we get is Green Tornado, Asian Cyborg, and Katana wannabe. If that type of damn near PLAGIARISM is allowed to go on further, I swear upon my mother's grave that Madhouse Studio will have earned itself a place on my hit-list, and finally live up to its name… literally! Have you seen what I can do with some paint and a little patience? I’ve transformed whole museums into art houses truly worth experiencing, how hard can a little cartoon company be?
And don’t give me all of that guff about “the animation,” kiddo, because I could care less. In a down to earth sense, what matters here ain’t the look, as I’ve learned throughout my days, it’s the substance behind the appearance. There’sa aint’sa no substance’s here to be found but a poorly written aneem, partner. 
So in short, avoid this like the plague. It neither makes you laugh nor accurately portrays all of those superpowered boners dicking around in tights. If you want superheroes, well then, put on a cape and a mask and hope I don’t kill your whole family. If you’re in the mood for a real laugh, go watch “A Serbian Film” or “Seinfeld.” Either one works!",1,TheClownPrince

                I have those friends who only watch superhero anime, and those who are obsessed with the superhero genre. They watch many western cartoons, and shows such as Dragon Ball Z, in which you see the common pattern of the main character being overpowered. Most often, they begin as an average person, who one day, discovers their power, or wants to protect their city, etc. I tend to see that the protagonist meets the antagonist, who is at that point stronger than them. Many villains later, the protagonist meets the primary antagonist, and attempts to stop them. At first the protagonist looks near defeat, but something,
                  such as the power of friendship, or determination, gives the protagonist the sudden strength required to defeat the antagonist. The fact that this pattern is repeated so often is annoying for me, and I feel that it's hard to sympathise with characters, when the plot armour is so evident. That's why I love One Punch Man, so immensely. It parodies the whole superhero genre, with it's light attitude.
In the fictional Japanese metropolis of City Z, we follow the story of Saitama, an overpowered hero, who only fights for fun. As represented by his name he can defeat anything in one punch, but this bores Saitama, so he infinitely searches for a worthy opponent. He meets people such as Genos, who is a robot, who represents one of your stereotypical heroes, searching for strength, and becoming Saitama's disciple. Saitama searches for recognition, for his heroic acts, but doesn't receive much attention, as people believe he's a counterfeit hero. This is what makes the viewer feel sorry for Saitama, as we venture through each episode, hoping his struggle will end.
The show tells us how a hero is  not all it seems to be, and everyone's motivation may vary. Many other characters are introduced later on, and the interaction between characters, brings humour, I haven't seen in other anime for a long time. The art and sound is amazing, despite the fact, the development team, received an average budget. This anime is outstanding, and people who hate the genre, can even come to love it. It's not shy of shocking you, and I'd say it's a must watch for any anime fans.",10,crumbstums

                In every single anime. great ones such as Fullmetal Alchemist all the way to shit ones likes SAO. We already know more-or-less the general ending. The hero prevails even under the most unlikely scenario...every...time. 
Many are those who say that One Punch Man is too predictable. Well I say One Punch Man is just more direct than other anime. OPM does away with the tease of power struggles and focuses on more important and unpredictable immersions which we would not love OPM without. We know Saitama always wins, but what about the world around him? What goes on inside people's minds? His reactions to society's
                  construct and behavior? The roles of others in times of turmoil? Human interactions among heroes?
Doing away with the power-struggle, One Punch Man was able to concentrate on these ideas that we can all relate to while having a blast watching Saitama completely annihilate every big-mouth in one spectacular punch. It's pure entertainment.
Oh whats that? You wanted to see struggle? The hero in danger? Well just look at Genos! A hero who's strong and badass enough, yet gets ripped to shreds in almost every one of his fights. You can always just concentrate on the other heroes and appreciate their struggle, but just know that at the end of the episode the heroes have to prevail so One Punch Man jumps into action and makes the good ending we've come to expect. Oh shit One Punch Man is also the name of the anime? Am I thinking about this too much? Is Saitama just a symbol for inevitable good endings in all anime? Is he bored of good endings because he for once wants the thrill of not knowing the outcome? Is there an alternative? Is this shit stupid? Yea this paragraph is pretty bad I should end the review.
As much as I enjoyed these 12 episodes, I would not be rating this season a 10 if a sequel was not on its way. Despite being 12 amazing episodes, One Punch Man hasn't expanded far enough into some crucial character development which it can definitely do with more time. 
The music and the animation are perfectly fitting and always nails the tone and the feeling it's going for especially during the awesome fights. 
PS - I know I haven't written much, but who actually reads past the 2nd or 3rd paragraph in a positive review that doesn't make you piss your pants like many SAO and other series prone to MAL's best comedic writers.

                One punch man is an okay show, okay in today's anime industry means it is a normal man standing in the middle of a group of retards. But the hype is way too much for OPM, cause the anime adaptation does not deserve it beyond the flashy visuals.
I seen all versions of OPM from the doodles by ONE, to the flashy version by Murata, to the current anime version. And the humor value decrease with each version.
ONE realized he is making a joke, so the art style that looks like scribbles was part of the joke, it was not meant to be taken that serious.
                  Yes there are serious part, but  the focus was comedy.
Murata on the other hand, took it too serious and while the action greatly improve in action, the humor associated with the original art style were gone.
As for the anime, it took it way too seriously. For example, the mosquito scene, in the original and Murata version it should be a slap on Saitama's face when he claimed he is invincible and emotionally dead when he got agitated by such a small thing. But the anime completely missed that context. And things like Genos background, in the manga was a wall of text in a panel that nobody reads, but the anime have it so long that the joke fall flat, you can't make fun of a concept and play it straight.
In fact the entire problem of the anime adaptation can be summed up in one phrase, ""it is too long"". Depressingly it is not something they could fix, you see OPM is one of those shows that suffer the adaptation time distortion disease, the two versions of the manga allows you to read through them very fast so the ""one-punch joke"" doesn't grow stale and you appreciate the characters more. But the for the anime version it is way too long for too little payoff.
As for the story, there really isn't much, it is all episodic, so the comedy and action are the story of the anime. The characters are more about making use and fun of various tropes, there are some depth to characters like mumen rider and saitama, but it is mostly flat.
Overall, if you like flashy actions, you would like it. But if you are here for the comedy, read Murata or ONE's manga. OPM anime is one joke stretched too long that caused it to rip it self in two, terrible shame.",7,ap1001

                One Punch Man starts with a brilliant concept, the protagonist isn't on his journey to become the strongest one, the most powerful hero on the planet, the pirate king or whatever; he already has reached the maximum level, defeating all his enemies with a single punch. As a viewer, you won't have to go through all the struggles that a hero might face like in every other typical battle shounen, and this is an incredibly satisfying and enjoyable aspect of the story. Saitama beats everyone. The parody of the shounen genre is refreshing and hilarious at time, Saitama is a passive MC who became a
                  hero for fun, he doesn't have any other standard motivation like protecting everyone, he is just bored. This can result in ridiculous situations, where even the people saved by him find it hard to believe his strength, since he doesn't look like a hero at all. Here you have ulterior satire in the contrast between Saitama and the other heroes, who are painted in a way you understand that their real motives are purely selfish- but they maintain a facade to be acclaimed by the citizen and rise to fame. 
The story is simple, pretty linear, but unique in a way you haven't seen before. It succeeds mainly as a parody, it never fails to make you laugh and it still can make you reflect at times, like when it tries to be a mirror to society and how the genuinely good people are most of the times surclassed by those who only care about their interests. It has some amazing fight scenes, the animation and production as a whole is incredible (well, it's madhouse), even the music is fitting.
The characters are really whats good about the show, Saitama and his disciple Genos are really good people, you come to care about them, and it's almost impossible to dislike them- Genos is loyal, correct guy, a true hero in my opinion. And Saitama is just awesome, ridiculously awesome. He has some amazing talent and doesn't even care about it, his facial expressions are almost idiotic, stylized to maximize his nonchalance. The supporting cast has some huge personalities.
Overall it's worth its hype, being 100% enjoyable and entertaining, what i think an anime should aspire to be, and with amazing production. Its only flaw is that by the end of the show, the story still hasn't gone nowhere. Well, not that it is necessary.

                One-Punch Man continuously combines the humour and extremely well made action sequences in a way I haven't seen before. This show hits you with a joke or a mind-blowing scene either in a battle or off the battle. The jokes are somewhat subtle - the humor is sometimes just implied. But it has a charm of its own in its own way.
Story: 10 - The story is a masterpiece without a doubt. As the title says he is a man of One-Punch battle.The world building is also great. ONE has successfully imagined a world brimming with heroes and monsters that is very interesting and feels
                  incredibly vast. There are all kinds of monsters in this show. We have monsters based on animals, monsters based off robots, monsters based off of rogue expert practitioners of martial arts, just to name a few. On the side of the heroes it's the same. We have here an incredibly diverse cast of heroes that all have very unique styles. The story pick offs from a very interesting development and the logic is crazy which makes it even better. A typical man becomes the worlds strongest man in three years with only casual training and lost his hair because of it. The story development is great and each episode will make you want to watch what happens one way or the another. 
Art: 8 - The art is brilliant. It is much better than expected. When One Punch Man was decided to be made into anime, not much expectations were made into the anime art. However not only the art is better than expected , the modern art brought into the anime makes the anime incredibly amazing.
Sound: 8 - The credit belongs to madhouse, the opening is so well done, it is so damn difficult to skip through it. ALso, the fights have amazing modern music which enhances the viewing and listening experience.
Character: 10 - Characters are just the best, I have grown fond of the characters from the very first episode. The characters are all unique and funny in their own way and that contributes greatly to the viewers' overall enjoyment of the show. Especially Saitama and Genos. 
Enjoyment: 9 - I am without a doubt enjoying the anime, I look forward to the day each episode is released for the fun 22 episodes of each episode. 
Overall: 10 - It is a masterpiece without a doubt which has been never seen before. The anime story,characters,art and story &amp; character development are all brilliant. I can't wait for the Season 2 of One Punch Man! （〜^∇^)〜",10,AreyKyoya

                The first time I heard about the ""One Punch Man"", I thought that it was something really stupid or boring, but after checking this anime myself, I can totally say that I enjoyed it more than I could expect. The title says enough about what the  main chcaracter is capable of, and the gag goes on for some episodes, introducing parodies and cliché villains, and characters all unique in their own regards.
What surprised me about this anime wasn't the main character, or the plot overall, but how even characters who appeared for few episodes, or even for few minutes were all particular detailed and
                  made.
The visuals, drawings and effects are simply amazing, as expected from Madhouse. Even in mere gags  and comedic scenes, the animation has always been on point. The music also is amazing. It is well timed to get you pumped and hyped for something, just as it can get sad or serious in other situations. The cast also is great! If you're a consumed anime watcher, or even a casual as myself, you'll probably recognise some very famous voice actors that played their roles perfectly.
To be fair, I'll point out a couple of flaws as well: First, is that, as me, you may not find some gags as funny as some others would, and the show tends to exaggerate itself too much even for comical standards. Plus, there is a lack of tension, as if there is no thrill or mystery to anything.
Nonetheless,  One Punch Man positively surprised me to the point that I can give it an almost perfect 10/10. Enjoyment, a little hype and fun. All you can desire from a series like this.",10,JThePervSummoner

The character of saitama is op and not op at the same time and his sidekick genos is just my favorite,this anime is just complete in every way and requires a deep mind to get into but it has comedy elements of children too.

Do try and read through this fully..
:p 
One Punch Man, saviour of anime or just a creator of an idiotic fanbase?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So its over, the most anticipated anime of fall 2015. An anime which generated so much fanbase that it routinely got subreddits of the day and had a subtopic created in meme pages. But as experience teaches us, popularity does not automatically convert to quality but we also cant deny if we act as hipsters and start dishing out
                  bad reviews just because they are popular, it makes us look like the fools. So where does One Punch Man stand really?
First of all the manga deals in a lot of themes, there are gags, there are subtle references to society, there are fights and there is ""man of steel"" esque destruction. It is a shounen action at heart and never tries to be something else. you will find over the top action, lots of dialogues in fights, lots of punches and kicks thrown, yeah, until the protagonist comes in.
Yeah One Punch Man is about this, it just shows the futility of the powerup times in dragonballz, the ""deep philosophical talk"" in between fights and even takes a jab on people talking in space. It is telling you, ""look there are so many tropes in shounens, but you know what at the end of the day its all about one finishing move, one punch"" and to do so they created an insaney op hero as a jab to all the OP badasses out there, and then giving a hilarious backstory of how he got his power. Which serves twofold, naive watchers and kids might try to follow his regimen and get fitter(of course some adult discussion is necessary so that the kid doesnt overwork himself), and this has actually happened in japan and secondly more seasoned watchers can understand this as a parody of all the various training regimes in different shounens.
However as you can already imagine, you know from beforehand how each fight will end, you know whatever be the opponent he is going to kill him by one punch, and that no matter how you look at it will reduce the thrill of the anime. But the anime intends to be that. Its almost as if it is telling you ""I am not you standard shounen with great fistfights, so if you expect sudden twists, you better drop me, I aint for you"". But then inspite of this the anime hooks a large section of the watchers, even watchers which are calling this one a shit anime. Why is that? it is because ""one punch Man"" isnt about One Punch Man, it isnt about Saitama killing villains, its not how whether he can recreate a big bang with his punch, its about something else. but to show that something else the author needed to put the obvious storyline in the way he did, and at the end, that cannot count as positive, even when I understand what his intention was.
One punch Man is about Saitama getting recognition he deserves, you root for him, want him to show the others how good he is , but then suddenly you find someone else to root for, a hero with no powers, trying his hardest, because ""its not about winning and losing its about whether you stand up to somebody"", and OPM delivered this to perfection in 1 line better than any other shounens have done in 200 episodes. And as more and more heroes get introduced, starting from the tsundere loli to the ninja and the martial artist, you tend to harbour some affectionate feeling for some of them as well(the names are sometimes hilarious as well Puri puri prisoner) and hate when they dont recognize saitama. this anime makes you either love/hate the characters, and unless its indifference thats pretty much a job well done for an anime.
And then in the final episode, MADhouse delivered one of its finest animation masterpieces. It elevated the manga by linking some stuff with the very first episode itself, created such fluidity in animation without much CGs that ufotable will be proud of them and used the correct soundtracks at the correct moment to create an epic final battle, a battle which lasted more than one punch. It is very rare for the anime transition from manga to be so brilliant even during the gags, but this last episode exceeded all expectations. When I read the manga , because the story wasnt that interesting(already said why), I wasnt really sure about the anime, but based MADhouse took that and created an anime which will rank among its best animated works for years to come(yeah you can fuck off hipsters, I have seen people saying the animation was bad trust me, either they are idiots or dont know English).
Oh yes one last thing, episode 12 actually makes you feel for the hero and villain both, in a way very different from any other anime out there.And the scrnshot you will find everywhere is actually a great depiction of how it is very lonely at the top. One came searching for a fight of a lifetime and got it, while the other at least had some enjoyment but still couldnot use his full potential. The last gag after credits was genius as well.
But as with all half decent anime, the problem was a cancerous fanbase which increased exponentially given the nature of the anime. the anime was fun, there were fights and OP characters with great animation and blood pumping music. Goku and Superman vs Saiatama posts flooded the groups and memes flooded the pages which resulted in antagonism towards the anime by a certain section. But is a cancerous fanbase the right parameter to judge how good an anime is? because then you are judging an anime not by the anime itself buy by the people who watch it, which is preposterous. I urge all the people to ignore all the OPM posts and judge the anime just as itself without the fanbase and you will see that even if it has created such a fanbase, it is still a damn good shounen, which makes you feel without melodrama and gets your blood pumping without shouting for one episode.
So in the end what is the answer to my original question. Saviour of anime? No. ""Just a creator of cancerous fanbase? No. this is an anime which made the world look up again. This is an anime which taught the world there are anime beyond DBZ. This is an anime which made the common mass who only watched DBZ look up and see how ""compactly"" an idea can be presented.
This is an anime which finally started putting the wheels in motion, so that the world can now move on from Dragonballz and realize even in that genre, even with just fistfights and no psychological battles, you can make a good anime and probably the anime which will inspire many more to actually delve more into the medium as such. And thats why probably it is a ""New Wave"" in the world of anime, even if it is not a saviour.

                WORD OF WARNING: MY REVIEW IS ON THE ANIME AND THE ANIME ALONE. I HAVE NOT READ THE MANGA OR THE WEB-COMIC.
I just don't understand the massive hype that surrounds One Punch Man. Everyone around me seems to have nothing but praise for it, whilst I'm sitting here - blankly - trying to figure out what was just so damn innovative about this anime. There was virtually no plot to One Punch Man and there is only so much humour can do to prop up something that doesn't have a leg to stand on.
Speaking of the humour; it was funny - at first. There was
                  a wry and satirical element to it that was quite charming. However, it wore thin and One Punch Man ended up feeling like a parody that had become a parody of itself due to the crap script and lack of an actual storyline. This probably has something to do with the fact that the Producers want to milk OPM for many seasons, but a lot of potential plot threads were left untouched and just hanging without any of the characters acknowledging their existence - almost as if those events never happened in the first place. It wasn't exactly frustrating, but moreso boring because OPM began to rely too heavily on a monster-of-the-week format, without hinting at even a semblance of an overarching plot. This meant that once I went to bed, and then woke up, I couldn't really remember what had happened in OPM the night before (and I have a very good memory). 
I think that speaks as a fundamental flaw regarding OPM because if it doesn't leave a lasting impression on one's mind how good can it really be, right? 
Even Saitama became boring to me mainly because the plot nowhere which meant that his character really didn't have any room to grow as a person. Once he became a member of the Hero Association, whatever development his character was experiencing suddenly stopped. He remained the same nonchalant and deadpan person that he was for the rest of the anime, which was, frankly, rather dull and did nothing to capture one's interest. He just remained flat.
I did enjoy supporting characters such as Genos, Sonic and Silverfang but it was just really difficult for me to root for Saitama when he was just so unappealing to me - personality wise, that is. (I care little for a characters looks.)
On a more positive note, I thought the animation of OPM was very, very good. The animators did a very good job in capturing Saitama's expressions and I was found it enjoyable watching his fight scenes and seeing him get excited. The OST matched very well to every frame, as well, though I sometimes found the electric guitar riffs a bit annoying. The closing theme was very beautiful too.
Also, despite my complaints regarding OPM it didn't bore me enough to force me to watch it and I did end up finishing it. I guess there was some sort of a charm to it, though it was significantly dulled by the end and I can't guarantee that I'll return for season 2.",5,jepifish
30276,"
                This show is a must watch in my opinion.
The one thing I will say is to not look too deep into what you think show is, I've seen people saying it strays away from its 'parody' tag and saying it as a bad thing. It doesn't really parody anything for any of the main characters.
Anyway onto the review none of you care about.
Story - 7
------------------------------
The story of OPM isn't a particularly deep one, nor is it that different from numerous other stories you've heard before. But it is a well told one, and a well paced one.
Effectively the show from 1 all the way through
                  to 12 is about our hero, Saitama, fighting things and generally being unbeatable. Whilst he goes around saving the day, all the other heroes and civilians believe him to be just a normal average hero, or a fraud. This he clearly isn't to anyone who sees him, but because of his outlook on heroism he doesn't really mind not being recognized as the best. The jokes of the show come mainly from this misunderstanding, or from the gross power difference between Saitama and whatever he's fighting.
Good story, not anything amazingly special though.
Art - 10
------------------------------
Now the art in this show is absolutely outstanding. The fight sequences have some of the most in depth and interesting artistry I've seen in a show. Take a look at the OPM manga, and imagine it fully animated. That's what you get here. 
Glorious.
Sound - 8
------------------------------
The sound for this show is brilliant. (In all honesty i don't know how sound could ever really be a 10/10, which is why this is an 8 from me.) The sound design hits all the triggers, and has lovely noises in all the right places. The fights feel heavy and epic, and the comedy feels slapstick and easy. The switches between these moments don't feel jarring, and flow together perfectly.
To top it off the OP for this show is great, and will have fans shouting 'WAN PANCH' at their screens when it hits.
Character - 7
------------------------------
A great selection of personalities is on show here, and they all complement each other wonderfully.
We have our Hero, Saitama - A hero for fun, slapstick and uncaring; all whilst being the most powerful man in perhaps the universe.
Alongside him is Genos - Saitama's disciple, and cyborg enamored by our hero's greatness.
Then we have the collection of heroes, all vying for power and recognition. Each with a distinct ability set and personality set.
Finally there comes the villains, these are effectively the reflection of the heroes. The again struggle to showcase their powers, but they differ in that they all have the mad super-villain motive of - destroy the earth, kill all humans.
Nice bunch of characters. Oh, and they're voice acted well too.
Enjoyment - 10
------------------------------
Whereas I can admit this show probably isn't for everyone, I think most people will love it. Its an easy watch, especially if you go and discuss it with some friends after the fact.
Yeah, if you're anything like me - you should feel the 'hype'.
Overall - 9
------------------------------
This is a well put together show, that faithfully adapts the source material in a way that only ever improves.
A must watch for anyone that likes anything, you may not love it but you should definitely give it a go.

==============================================
THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS ANIME: THE CONCEPT
==============================================
The good thing about this anime is the concept is different with other superhero anime. Normally, you will watch super villain who smart and very dangerous, and the super hero who want to protect the city at all cost. Normally it is serious. 
In this anime, THE CONCEPT IS FLIPPED upside down
Now, the villain is just a stupid person who want to beat the others and the main character is super strong and can beat the villain into pulp by just one punch. And it is wrapped in comedy-action drama.The concept is good.
==============================================
THE BAD THING ABOUT THIS ANIME: ALL EXCEPT THE CONCEPT
==============================================
I expect this to be a good comedy anime, so I just sit casually, but...
1. First, the comedy is not really funny. In the first episode, There is a child with chin like a butt. I find it is not funny at all. Then, most of every episode there is a naked man. Then the bad guy turns into a stupid person who act cool when winning. ""I sound like a robot to make it cool"". And this joke is repetitive. The same joke is shown over and over.
2. The main characters is a hero for fun. He has no interest at helping people at all. He is so selfish and egoist.
If there are monsters, he does not care about the others' safety. If others are injured and like dying, he does not care, or sometimes he just asked ""are you alive?"" but nothing more.
He rarely listens to other people and rarely becomes serious in real life.
He does not care about others' opinion about himself because at the first place, he is already been by himself alone. He is anti-social and never in this anime he decided to discuss about plan or working together..
The main character here is not a good character. I bet if Saitama does not have the power, nobody will praise him for his attitude.
The only good character in this anime is mumen rider. Even though he is weak, he keep trying to help others.
3. No main conflict and no twist.
In this 12 episodes anime, you will find repetitive episode over and over. 
The difference is there is another new villain.
There is a little conflict though: ""a hero who do not get appraised"", but actually saitama do not care at all, because at the first place he is anti-social. He did not get any disadvantages at all because of this issue.
Then, no twist. Saitama is still the most powerful character till the end.
==============================================
SUMMARY
==============================================
So, here I will give 4 as bad.
It will be good if you have a different taste of joke than me. 
However, I prefer joke like ""si juki"" or ""Bowling King"" who can make you laugh hard.",4,Rhyned

                A little history of One Punch Man, it originates from a webcomic. At first, the first chapter of One Punch Man was drawn by ONE as a test of a new app to draw manga. He later uploaded the chapter on his site, somehow it got recognition and more demands on the next chapter. ONE continued drawing and it became a huge, reaching 15 millions views in one week. Yusuke Murata approached ONE to make a collaboration. Yusuke Murata is responsible for the redrawing and ONE improves  the plot of the manga.
Story 9/10
The story is very basic, even a kid would understand thus this
                  anime is very suitable for everyone. It's about a guy, who trained so hard that he became so strong to the point he can defeat everyone with a punch. Yes, I know what you're thinking. One punch and it's over, isn't that boring? The author knows that it would be boring, that's why the story does not only tell about Saitama, it tells about others too. Saitama isn't the only character in this anime.

                This anime is so simple, yet so compelling. It's about as stripped-down in terms of world building and characters as you can get without going too far. At least what you do get is exactly what the storyteller wants you to receive, which is a lot of funny and cool stuff.
I don't feel like the story in One Punch-Man is necessarily amazing, but it works for what the message is meant to portray: Saitama, the protagonist, is so powerful, his superheroing is boring. He somehow got so overpowered, the joy of the fight, the struggle to survive and the ""kill-or-be-killed"" is utterly erased from his
                  life. Try to find a story about this sort of character elsewhere and you probably won't find it. Thus, we have a very original, unblemished premise.
This premise is born out of the cliched tropes used over and over again in your typical superhero storytelling in order to turn it on its head. Most of what happens is the opposite of what usually happens in a typical hero's journey. 
Usually, the hero is young, especially in anime/manga, and he starts out weak, but grows stronger and stronger as the story progresses through loads of training. He's usually not the most powerful character in his story world. His antagonist usually is. But, Saitama is 25-years-old and just IS the most powerful right from the beginning; there is nary an antagonist who can withstand being punched by him more than one time.
With a story premise like this, where do you go from there? It might seem like it would dead-end, but that's why this anime is so great. It actually goes into that territory to reveal that it doesn't have to be a dead-end, after all. We find that our hero is not the picture of perfection, thus we can have conflict, after all. He is very strong, but not a perfect human being. He's a good guy, but he has no job and he's not the smartest guy out there, nor is he the most handsome. Hardly. He even has a totally bald head, which is about as opposite the typical anime/manga hero as it gets, with their usually trademark crazy green/blue spiky weird hairstyles.
On top of that, his sidekick disciple, Genos, is younger, better-looking and cooler than he is! (Well, Genos is a cyborg, so....) Genos is so much more the hero-in-progress than Saitama, but he is the support role in the story, not the main character. Again, a typical trope turned upside-down. He is also one of the few characters that recognizes Saitama as the over-powered being that he is.
Which leads me to the next interesting aspect of this story: Saitama, while being ridiculously strong and regularly saves people and the world from destruction, never really gets the recognition or praise he is due by other people. In fact, he is barely known by anyone and is even sometimes despised by others because he allows other heroes in the Registry to take credit for his accomplishments. (Talk about a humble guy.) And, because of this, he is often shown sporting some jealousy of Genos when he is opening up the packages of fan mail he regularly receives, full of gushing praise for how ""kakkouii"" he is. All Saitama gets is a thank you note from another hero in the Registry, if not some hate-mail.
In this world, there are hundreds of Registered ""heroes"" and they are all ranked according to video game standards, ""S"" being the highest, while ""C"" seems to be the lowest rank. A ""C""-ranked hero is basically a regular human being who is just brave enough to intervene in stopping purse-snatchers and muggers as they are in the act of committing their crimes. There are hundreds of these guys, and we see how cut-throat it is being in the Registry. 
Mumen (Licenceless) Rider, who is just a guy on a bicycle, stands as the Everyman. He is brave, but powerless, and will fight against his own anger at himself while trying to defeat a monster beyond his scope. You realize you relate to him the most because he is a metaphor for every human being whoever tried to live their life in this rat-race of a world we live in. It is merciless and we are powerless to control what happens, and to even do anything about it. Those few who are capable rise to the top (like the higher-ranked heroes with real superhuman abilities), whether they deserve it or not, and they usually do not. Neither do the higher-ranked heroes, as they are self-centered egomaniacs only concerned with how popular they are, just like real people who do well in life often are.
I see a lot of Gintama in this anime. Gintama fans should totally dig this, but where Gintama parodies specific animes/mangas and Japanese culture, One Punch-Man parodies this one section of anime/manga/comics tropes, which results in a masterful parody of modern life itself. Check this out for the laughs, the turned-on-their-heads tropes and the fantastic characters who grow on you very quickly.",9,NakeBenihime

                This show definitely deserves all the hype it has. 
If you haven't seen this show and are considering it, I would highly recommend investing your time in this.
you may think that a story centered around the most OP character ever created may get boring at times, as did i, before watching the show but i have never been so wrong!
the show mixes a colorful cast of well designed characters with an amazing soundtrack and fairly simple plot to create a well-balanced and fully fleshed out show that kept me interested throughout the shows 12 episode run time.
I may be the first One-Punch advocate to admit
                  that the show is not perfect. There were some boring down-times and arcs that may seem irrelevant and some major plot holes that a not seasoned anime fan may become stuck on, and i feel at times i was hanging on the back of one character, Saitama, to carry me through the show.
That being said, Saitama is one of the most likable characters in the history of anime. He manages to keep the show light and comedic, and i feel if he was replaced by another copy-paste character, the show would be labeled as a ""try too hard dragon ball knock-off"".
The show is very satirical at times and makes fun of anime in general, as Kill La Kill attempted to do in 2013. I feel as if they make all the characters OP on purpose. It always seem as as if one villain outshines the last, and every hero get increasingly more powerful as the show went on, trying to get the audience as hyped up as they can before the finale, and it worked.
Speaking of the finale, the show's end was fairly satisfying, leaving me with a feeling of closure. Just when you think the show couldn't get any crazier, it gets crazier. The animation was well done and the music was outstanding. The show also sets up for a potential season 2, which is scheduled to premiere in October, and i am very excited to see how much farther Mad House can take it.
All things considered, i rate this show a 9. I know people on this site all have different scoring method, myself included, but if i had to rate the show on a level of enjoyment(which i did for this review) this show would get a solid 10 by me, no questions asked, and i think that's the most important thing.",9,chijeu

                I haven't watched much anime in recent years.  Like a lot of users, I was an avid consumer of the medium in my early 20s, but my viewership steadily declined as I approached 30 and other interests took over.  A few years ago, I watched ""Attack on Titan"" and it was dreadful, giving me the impression that I wasn't missing out on much.  
One night, on a lark, I decided to give ""One Punch Man"" a shot, which I didn't have particularly high hopes for.
Not only did it turn out to be an excellent series, but it revitalized my interest in anime.
                   
The show is simple enough, following the exploits of heroic, dull-witted Saitama, who decides to become a costumed hero after failing a job interview and encountering a half human, half crab mutant in his underwear attacking people nearby.  Unfortunately, after three years of training, he has reached a point where he kills every opponent with a single punch, leading to a boring existence where no villain, no matter how terrifying or deadly, presents any challenge to him.  
Surely, this one-note joke would wear thin quickly?  
It doesn't, thanks to the series' masterful navigation between action, humor, and parody, all within the same episode.
As a pure action series, cutting out all the jokes, it's very good.  Fight choreography is crisp and frequently inventive, featuring an array of moves and bizarre combatants.  Madhouse did a fine job animating it, with numerous frames and a keen eye for detail.  Hell, ""One Punch Man"" is a much better fight anime than most dead serious shows in the genre.  Consider the match between Genos and Mosquito Girl.  Take away Saitama's presence, and you have a memorable fight that wouldn't be out of place in any classic action anime.  
And that's an important point to keep in mind.  The fights themselves are always treated with full seriousness, never as a joke.  This gives them meaning, important in a series where the protagonist's victory is assured.    
As a comedy, it's not uproarious, but it has plenty of funny moments.  Saitama's calm, dull-witted attitude towards life in the midst of inhuman freaks, a silly professional Hero Association, and a generally bizarre world produces considerable amusement.  At the same time, it doesn't go too far, to the point of making Saitama an idiot or embarrassing him, as so many other series do.  This is especially important because at crucial moments throughout the series, Saitama proves that he is a real hero, not merely in physical strength but in strength of character.  
In fact, the entire cast shines here.  The teen cyborg Genos is a trusty, likable sidekick to Saitama.  Amai Mask and Metal Knight are both enigmatic, seemingly villainous entities whose intentions are shrouded in mystery.  Even one-note characters like Spring Mustachio or Puripuri Prisoner are funny and have more inspired designs than many leads.  Everyone has a unique look and defined personality.  
As a parody, there are numerous characters and moments inspired by other shows.  Some are played for laughs, like the arrogant ninja killer Sonic being a hapless, overconfident take on Hiei from YuYu Hakusho.  Or the Deep Sea King's fangs and heart decorations reminding one of Dio Brando from JoJo. 
Others are worthy tributes to the original, like Genos being a version of Casshern.    
Combine the action, humor, and parody together, and one has a truly special, excellent series, one whose mass popularity is genuinely deserved.  Strongly recommended for all anime fans.",8,YoungVagabond

                (No spoiler)First thing you must do when you are watching one punch man is understand the idea of the anime is a anime with so much humor so do not expect that everything make sense.
The story pratically do not exist i could resume in a monster invade the city and saitama win but don't think it's a bad point the anime have so much humor and the characters make you want to continue the anime.
The art is spetacular i think funny how this anime use the face of saitama of the manga is spetacular, the design of the characters is very much good is very
                  unique and the animation is spetacular too in the dialogs and in the fights.
The sound is very good i like it very much the opening is great but the ending is that generical ending of anime and the soundtrack while the anime is good but nothing spetacular the great point in the sound is in the opening.
The characters are great mainly the main characters(saitama and genos) they have so much charisma and are unique saitama isn't that generical protagonist of the shounen he is really diferente.
The enjoyment is very good you will want to continue and continue so the end comes and the characters and the humor make this happen.
One punch man is a great anime i don't was waiting for something so good, I recomend but please do not take this anime seriously if you keep in your head that this anime is made for doesn't make any sense and just be cool you will like it.",9,Megan_n

                Hype is the first thing that pops up in your head when hear One Punch Man, and why wouldn't it. One Punch Man fans have been extremely excited ever since it was confirmed to get an anime series. Nevertheless, with hype comes a lot of expectations. One mess up and you’ll get hate from both manga/webcomic fans and those who wanted to see what One Punch Man is all about. Luckily Madhouse knows what they’re doing very well and they didn’t disappoint. The anime is a page-by-page adaptation of what fans wanted, and what newcomers are now interested in. Its satirical style parodying shounen and
                  superhero tropes makes this a breath of fresh air in the anime medium. A gateway anime to many, One Punch Man helps in increasing the anime community.
~{Story}~
The story focuses on Saitama, an average, bald-headed, expressionless man. However, little can one expect him to be the strongest man on earth who defeats all of his opponents with just one punch (hence the title!). The problem is that he is so strong that he is craving for a strong enough opponent so he can have fun with what he’s doing. The story right off the bat feels very unique. Many anime focus on the protagonist becoming more and more powerful. However One Punch Man focuses the aftermath of that story, and how being the strongest may not be as good as it sounds. Though it may see uninteresting at first, because for how long can you have fun with a protagonist that is flawless in his strength, however the anime does a great job handling that as it’s jokes end up staying fresh and its focus on other characters makes you still keep your interest. One Punch Man may not have the most fantastically written story, but it gets the job done. And it’s the simplicity of the story that makes it the more enjoyable. Just leave your brain somewhere else and you’ll have a blast with One Punch Man. 
Story: 8.5/10
~{Presentation}~
As a superhero-action anime, it delivers with its large-scale battles. As a parody-comedy it delivers with its satirical humor and hilarious characters. One Punch Man exactly what it is and it makes sure to only focus on that. No deep messages (besides Mumen Rider’s speech), no buildup, no tragic storylines, just a crap load of fun. One Punch Man is sort up built up of small story arcs that rarely connect to one another besides its characters. And each arc delivers in entertainment, whether it be large-scaled, beautifully animated action, or slapstick humor. The pacing is also really good, as the anime takes its time on focusing on other characters and delivering consistent entertainment without any empty moments. The concept of One Punch Man is something that easily could have been a disaster, but luckily doesn’t. It’s absolutely perfect in its presentation. It’s an anime that can bring in the most experienced anime watchers, and those who are entering this medium and are new to it. It parodies on superheroes is something that can appeal to a larger audience than just anime fans. The mixture of comedy and action makes this one of the greatest anime to come in recent times.
Presentation: 9.5/10
~{Character}~
Saitama is a breath of fresh air in terms of action protagonists. Most characters focus on getting stronger, Saitama would envy those characters as he is too strong to enjoy his fights, if they can even be considered as fights. Saitama is hilarious and badass at the same time, so no wonder why he is so likeable. Saitama’s transition from a detailed expression to expressionless will get me every time. Saitama’s disciple, Genos, is one complete badass. He wants to become stronger, and Saitama is his hope. Even if he gets his ass kicked more than he does to others, his style and fighting skills are what makes him get a lot of fans, in the anime and outside. One Punch Man offers a humongous cast of character and each of them are unique in their own way. You have Sonic, the baddie that can’t admit someone can be stronger than him, Mumen Rider, who may not have the most strength, but he has the most heart, and so much more. The heroes impress with their uniqueness and their humorous presentation, the villains impress with their over-the-top concepts and designs. There’s always a character you end up loving in One Punch Man, because of the likeability of all of the characters. However, there are some characters that do get sidelined at times are just used to merely be a contrast for Saitama. However characters are great enough to cover up this flaw.
Character: 9/10
~{Art}~, 
Madhouse really went on point with the art of One Punch Man. There were two ways to tackle it: make the art cruddy looking to add to the humor (just like the webcomics), or make the art extremely detailed and fancy (like the manga remake). Madhouse manages to find a place between the two as the anime uses sketchy-style drawing as an effect, yet have detailing that makes the anime still gorgeous. This way, the studio gets to please both webcomics and manga fans, while bringing in new fans. The backgounds are well detailed. The color palette is restricted for the better. Vivid and bright colors wouldn’t work with One Punch Man, so the limited color usage is great. The character designs are superbly presented. Each character looks totally unique in their own ways. Characters such as Watchdog Man wearing a dog costume to fight crime is just one of the many ridiculous designs this anime has to offer. Not to mention Genos looks extremely great with his cyborg design. And the most important part, Saitama is designed perfectly with him jumping around between an excited character with a detailed, buffed-up design, to an unenthusiastic, minimal detailed, average looking character. 
Art: 10/10
~{Animation}~
Just like the art, Madhouse manages to deliver extremely smooth animations that can satisfy for webcomics and manga fans. The sketchy and smooth feeling combine to make superb animations. With its large-scale battles, all over-the-top, the animations bring those to life. The smooth rotations used in this anime show how beautifully animated it is. The contrast between the over-the-top animations with Saitama’s simplistically drawn face adds up to its already excellent humor. Only very few anime can be so consistent with its style and One Punch Man manages to succeed. The animations are so fast that they don’t give you time to breath and that is just perfect. The fast-pacing and the animations perfectly blend together. Not to mention that the final fight was so well done, and so well stylized that I couldn’t help but grin like a creep for the entire episode. There are very slight hiccups with the animations, but they easily get overshadowed with the animations that are great in One Punch Man. Also character movements have a very realistic feeling to it (such as Mumen Rider getting of his bicycle). The realism makes it feel like as if the animations were rotoscoped at times.
Animation: 10/10
~{Voice Acting}~
Since there is an abundance of characters in One Punch Man, a large seiyuu cast is required. The two main characters of One Punch Man, is voice acted by seiyuu that weren’t much heard of, yet they still manage to do an excellent job as Saitama and Genos. Furukawa Makoto does a great job as Saitama as he can give both energy and a lack enthusiasm at perfect times. He is the perfect voice for Saitama. And it’s funny how they got a zero to voice act Satama and after this anime he might become a hero. Ishikawa Kaito does Genos and he does it perfectly. He is able to add the coolness to Genos and that desperation of trying to get stronger. He really did make Genos into a fan magnet with his voice acting skills. A lot of big name seiyuu do some pretty minor characters, considering their talent. Miyano Mamoru is Amai Mask, Namikawa Daisuke is Doctor Genus and Pig God, Hayami Saori is Fubuki, Sawashiro Miyuki is Mosquito Girl, Nakamura Yuuichi is Mumen Rider, Miki Shinichiro is Snek, Kaji Yuki is Sonic, Yuuki Aoi is Tatsumaki, and Sakurai Takahiro is Zombieman (He only said one line!). Everyone manages to do fantastic with their role, because of their excellent skills.
Voice Acting: 9/10
~{Music}~
At first, I was pretty afraid about the music as One Punch Man needs the perfect music to be more than what it can be. Once again, One Punch Man doesn’t disappoint in this category. The Opening “THE HERO !!”, is perfect as it perfectly represents what this anime is about. It’s super catchy and it warms you up for what is yet to come. However the ending “Hoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru”, is the complete opposite as it’s too peaceful and soothing to be an One Punch Man ending. However, that’s what makes it more enjoyable as it adds so much irony to the anime. Not to mention it’s a beautiful song. The OST is outstanding. Every track impresses. Its adrenaline filled beats are sure worth listening to on repeat. The Genos Theme in particular is what impressed me the most. And the OST that is played when Saitama gets the job done is perfect too. Oh, and who can forget Mumen Rider’s Theme! The music is so well placed during the action scenes that I couldn’t be more impressed as a One Punch Man fan.
Music: 10/10
~{Enjoyment}~
The entertainment values One Punch Man has is through the roof. With is hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, its parodies on superhero and shounen tropes and its large-scale battles, you’ve got one entertaining anime. Add the beautiful animations and art, and some fantastic background music, and you’ve got this anime elevated to a whole new level. One Punch Man’s got something for everyone, whether they be experienced anime watchers on newcomers, One Punch Man is here to appeal to anyone. It manages to please One Punch Man’s webcomic and manga fans as it incorporates both styles together in one in the anime version.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Overall, One Punch man is a breath of fresh air in the anime medium. It’s a great gateway anime for those who aren’t familiar with the anime medium, and its feels something unique and fresh for those who have been watching anime for a long time. It pleases manga and webcomic fans by being loyal to the original source. With its great humor and over-the-top action, mixed with its high production values, great animations and fantastic music, it’s a complete entertainer. If you haven’t watched the most hyped anime of the decade yet, you’re missing out. Try it out and see how you like it! I’ll be off to make some more One Punch Man gifs!
+ A complete entertainer in both comedy and action. 
+ Fantastic concept about the life of an overpowered character.
+ Great cast of characters, that are all unique and they stand out from one another.
+ Production values are through the roof as the art and animations are some of the best ever made.
+ The OST is superb as it is totally adrenaline boosting. 
- Some supporting characters get side-lined at times.

In recent time, every other coming out is so hyped that it is treated as god's gift to mankind and every fanboy claims that it is the “savior of anime”. And the show this season that has been labeled “the savior of anime” is One-Punch Man but is this show really as good as the fanboys say or is it just another overhyped pile of garbage. Let’s find out.
Story
In case you don’t know the plot of One Punch Man, it’s pretty self-explanatory, the guy wants to become a hero so he trains really hard that he loses his hair and can now defeat
                  any of his opponents in just one punch. And the plot for any given episode is very basic: Saitama meets a really ridiculous and over the top bad guy and with that comes comedy then he is defeated in just One Punch and rinse and repeat you get One Punch Man. But I’m not going to sit here and criticize its story because that’s not what One Punch Man is even about and if you go into it expecting an amazing story, you’re going to miss the whole point of the show. But I must say that in the story department, One Punch Man is quite lackluster.
Characters
One Punch Man follows the story of Saitama. You know the rule in anime that the longer the hair the greater the power, the rule that Naruto Bleach and Dragonball follow and in the midst of this comes Saitama as a parody of the whole shounen genre. Saitama was a normal guy working a normal job, but all of this changed when he saves a child and decides that he will now become a hero for fun. And from then on Saitama trains day in and day out to become stronger and, as a result, he trains so hard that he loses his hair… Because that totally makes sense. Saitama is a very funny character and the juxtaposition of what he looks like and what he can do is pretty amazing and he definitely is a badass. Though Saitama is funny and is a badass he is just that. He is very 2D and there isn’t much to him other than those two traits. But that’s the charm of his character.
The second main character is Genos aka Tony goddamn Stark as that is pretty much what he is. He has a very cool introduction, but he is a very weird character as though he is a good companion to Saitama and both of together are a good duo and have charisma together it always felt like he was the damsel in distress always needing Saitama to come save the day.
There aren’t really any other characters that actually matter apart from the antagonists. A great antagonists can make or break a show such as Johan Liebert from Monster or Gilgamesh from Fate Zero and on that front, One Punch Man definitely delivers. You know amazing antagonists such as a Giant Crab Wearing underwear and a mole, a goddamn mole! All joking aside, that’s not what One Punch Man is even going and by no means will you remember the antagonists because they only get around 3 to 4 minutes of screen time per episode.
Music
The music for the show was good. The OST perfectly compliments the tone of the show with intense scenes with intense music. And the opening and ending songs are pretty amazing.
Production/History
One Punch Man is the adaptation of an ongoing webcomic of the same name written by the manga author ONE and has been adapted by Studio Madhouse. And I must say, Madhouse has knocked it out of the park keeping in mind this is what the source material looked like. Almost every episode has, at least, one scene that looks incredible. But the animation definitely the highlight of the show.  One Punch Man premiered in the Fall of 2015 with 12 episodes and knowing Madhouse, we probably won’t get a sequel. 
Negatives
At points, One Punch Man was just kind of childish and didn’t make me laugh but these scenes were few and far between. This is not a series  you can marathon, it gets boring and repetitive easily as the joke becomes less funny as each episode passes and some episodes such as episodes 3 and 4 being absolutely boring.
Positives
But This anime does something that most fail at. One Punch Man handles tonal shifts very well, it goes from totally dumb to totally badass and back. It is a very self-aware show and isn’t trying to be the next big masterpiece. One Punch Man is one of the only anime that actually made me laugh. 
Conclusion
And with the ridiculous amount of hype surrounding this show, I’m kinda sad to say that it doesn’t live up to the hype and it is impossible for it but the show is definitely entertaining if all you're looking for is some dumb fun but if you want any more from this show you will definitely be disappointed especially if you’re on the hype train. And it certainly not the best anime of the year but it definitely is one of the most enjoyable ones. And with all that being said I give this anime a 7/10.

                ""Do you honestly think you won't get any stronger for the rest of your life? Instead of sitting around frustrated, it's better to keep on moving forward. I'm going now. Today's a special day in case you didn't know. The market's selling veggies at 30% off.""
This quote is basically everything what One Punch Man is about.
Mixing serious thoughts with comedy might be the best way how to deliver something deep without looking like a smart aleck. Well, the action side of this series is worth watching as well – mainly due to its very nice and fluid animation, but also because there are plenty of
                  other interesting characters who can actually get hurt. 
I think that the people, who didn’t enjoy this show, were trying to find something in it that was never intended to be there. I am talking about romance and other daily problems a normal person can relate to. Maybe it is because of the way OPM is parodying other superheroes series. It takes all the overly used stereotypes and confront them with the real world, which makes you realize how stupid they actually are. E.g. every hero has to have a tragic background story, revenge is the number one motivation, an attack is only as powerful as its name, etc.… The other thing this show is taking from a real world is the human nature. Even though there are some nice people, the majority is not – especially in the times, when something is screwed up, the need for a culprit is bigger than the need for a hero. All those things might lead you to a conclusion that this show will get more and more real, but it won’t. So don’t watch it if that is what you were looking for – you will not enjoy it. 
Luckily for me OPM was just what I wanted. Actually just the imagination that I myself should come up with a watchable 12 episodes long story based on a character that is so overpowered that no one can defeat him and stick to it for the whole time is certainly something I have never seen before.
The key lies in the diversity. So far a lot of characters were introduced, but almost every one brought something new in the show:
Saitama’s main purpose is to deliver us wisdom in a way that will entertain us as well. ""Let me make one thing clear! I'm not working as a hero because I want you morons to admire me! I do it 'cause I want to!"" As I’ve stated in my preview before the way I understood this is that whatever it is we do in our lives, we should always be passionate and enthusiastic about it. 
Genos carries the potential plot, which might make the show be even more interesting in the future.
Mumen Rider … even though he is weak, his extreme sense of justice and devotion to help others is provoking me to be a better person too.
Sonic is an embodiment of an egocentric person. He is not a real villain. He just wants to be acknowledged. The only reason we get to see him more is just because Saitama is aware of it as well.
S-heroes … they are all unique. We haven’t seen everyone in action yet, but they seem to have very different characters, plus their special powers are making the show more exciting. 
Besides the opening I wasn’t aware of any music that would stand out. But if you take the time to listen to the OST you may actually be surprised how good the soundtrack is. 
So, if you have the time and you like super heroes, I recommend you to watch it. Really! I was more excited to see the last episode than the new Star wars movie. It had to be very difficult for the author to keep the show fresh every week, but it was executed very well.",9,Mortax

                This is my first review, so I'll try to be brief and clear.
Story - 10: The plot revolves around Saitama, a perfectly average looking guy who, after three years of hard training, has become so strong he can defeat every enemy with one single punch. Despite this, he has no popularity whatsoever, so he dreams to be recognized as a hero by his fellow citizens. His struggles to achieve this goal give birth to some of the most hilarious scenes ever: the storyline is simple yet funny and it never gets boring.
Art - 9: The art is simply amazing. The contrast between the fluid, high
                  detailed batlle scenes and the comcal ones (which almost resemble a parody) makes this show even funnier than it already is.
Sound - 10: The soundtrack for this show cannot be described by mere words......It fits the anime perfectly, it actually makes you feel like you can destroy anything with just one punch. And the opening is just fantastic......
Characters - 10: Because of the storyline being so simple, what really makes this series so good are its characters. Saitama, for example, is one of my favourite characters out of all the animes I've seen so far, just because he's so unique. Some of the other characters are really interesting too. If there will be a second season, I'd really like to see a bit more development on their side.
Enjoyment -10: I honestly would have never expected to like this show so much, considering this isn't even one of my favourite genres.....But i guess I was wrong, so here I am, so hyped about it that I decided to write my first review.
Overall - 10: I seriously think this show deserves all the success it has if not even more....I wholeheartedly recommend it to any anime fan out there. Surely enough, if you don't like comedy it might seem a little plain, but still, if you're looking for something not too demanding or you just want to relax after watching a really complex series then be sure to check it out.

There once was a man with hair on his head,
who beats up people, ""boring"" he says.
He swore to himself he would become stronger,
on behalf of other people who won't even bother.
He ran 10 kilometers, every single day,
to become a hero for fun, not for the pay.
As for the fame, that is a
                  different story,
he doesn't seek the riches, only the glory.
With 100 sit ups, push ups and squats.
All for three years, is what he plots.
After it's been done, he stands proud,
infront of his restroom mirror, is where he vowed.
There was one problem, it was his hair,
it disappeared, to be seen no-where.
With a potatoe for a face, he stood still,
his eyes went dotted and so did his will.
If for only a second, he was pale,
he turned back around and this was his tale.
ONE PUNCH!!!
That's all that it takes! A power of Gods,
his limits? No breaks!
He nails every villain that threatens the world,
ending with a smile, with his fingers curled.
Explosions like a nuke, those were the impacts,
creating a vortex without landing smacks!
Once with his disciple whom he left shocked,
turning around to see a mountain... No mountain,
while Saitama simply walked.

                One of the best anime in 2015
The main ingredient, which is action, is depicted quite well. Being famous as a one-hit kill, Saitama is indeed doesn't need much action screen time by his side. His opponents? well they got the privileges. And the anime makes it quite well timed. Although the character developments doesnt seem too good, it's tolerable. Since the anime only have 12 episodes.
However, the comedy, which also it's strong component, can't come to terms VERY FUNNY. It tickles, but you wont screaming laughter or walk funny after watching. This anime was hyped for being gagful and laughable. But the execution on the
                  comedy part is a bit lousy.
Maybe there's also this minor thing where we actually can enjoy this anime in a long-term show because of these mysteries in our mind about the power all the S-class squad. But the PH squeezed it into one- forcefully trying to be amazing- season consists of 12 episode 
Overall, this anime is quite good. I myself feel refreshed because there's finally a new mascot in anime world. Not just over-popular main chara like Kirito, Kaneki,etc. But a new Goku, Naruto, or Conan.
But it's not worth the hype.
This anime is Majestically Great, but not Perfect.
All im saying is, this anime is worth re-watching, but not worth the hype.
The hype for this anime,for me, is something that should be dedicated for anime that maybe scores 11/10.

                This is the first review I wrote for one of the most hyped anime series ever! And boy, the hype was worth it. This anime was a blast. Oh, and also: THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS.
Story/Enjoyment: 8.5/10
I couldn't really see a plot in this anime, which was why I combined the score of the story and the enjoyment. This absolutely had no story whatsoever, BUT... it doesn't change the fact that this is a parody. There was no intention for a story. This was just a sit-back-and-relax type of series where you don't need to think and take it seriously; and I don't mind that; because
                  I freakin' LAUGHED MY ARSE OFF HERE! This was hilarious. The battle scenes were very intense and exciting to see as well!

Character: 10/10
I loved how Saitama had went through each of the ""arcs"" and finally take on one of the most powerful enemies he's taken on. First of all, it was like eating a piece of sultana. Then as the series progressed, the enemies had become harder to beat until at the final battle, he couldn't beat the enemy within ONE PUNCH.

                One time somebody said that One Punch Man was the new Attack on Titan, and I died a little inside. Nobody wants their new favorite show to be the new Attack on Titan, but god damn it, I can't help myself but like it.
One Punch Man started off as a webcomic with really shitty art, but after it became super popular, some ho made a manga out of it, and now it's an anime.
The story is very fun. It's about a guy who wanted to be a hero for fun, but soon became too strong, and stopped having fun fighting people and stopping bad guys.
                  It was all too easy. Then a cyborg kid who wanted to stop evil and kill the cyborg who killed his family came along, and insisted that our hero Saitama teach him how to be a hero and to become strong.
The characters are all super funny and ridiculous. I think the characters are what made me love this show, particularly Saitama.
I really enjoyed the show, so I definitely recommend it.",9,titandick

                One Punch Man: You'll either hate it or love it. 
For me, it's the latter. 
If you're in for the comedy and action, you'll love it.
If you're specifically looking for a serious plot-driven anime, then back off from this show.
One Punch Man's (henceforth OPM) storyline is actually quite simple, but with a fun twist. Saitama's this bald, bored, and overpowered man who is constantly looking for an opponent that won't perish from his single punch. Tough luck for him. At Saitama's expense, it was soooo hilarious to see him get depressed because his opponents were too weak. 
We are used to seeing anime MC'S struggling
                  to become strong and fighting the bad guys, getting all beaten up. But...In OPM Saitama never even got injured. The worst case for Saitama is...ending up naked. 
Then there's this straightforward cyborg named Genos who's Saitama's apprentice.
Then Saitama registered to become an official hero and take on (weak) bad guys. 
The end. 
That's basically the story is about. Simple yet fun. I laughed so hard even just a few minutes watching the first episode.However, the story didn't get a 10 from me because it's plot is simplistic and there's no real tension there. But that's one of OPM's charms; simplicity and fun.
The art is simple yet it suits the show, I dunno why. The background is not particularly breathtaking or anything but it's juuust right. The debris especially were also given detail. Battle scenes are done very nicely; it's smooth and entertaining to watch.
In the sound department, the OP really suits the show! It's very catchy and full of hype. The ED is also nice, but it reminds me of Dragon Ball's Romantic no Ageru Yo. Somehow the ED brought a sense of nostalgia to me, and it's not a bad thing. The tracks used were in perfect sync with the events that happened, and the voice actors have done a really great job! I think Saitama's and Genos' VA really suits the characters.
Characters of OPM are not really that developed nor do they change. However, almost all of the characters are lovable, and there was only one character that I felt was kinda annoying. Saitama is strong strong strong. Genos is strong but is the epitome of a normal (superpowered) anime MC; strong but not too strong. OPM definitely lacks some character-building, but the focus of OPM is not really on the character development. *winks winks* 
I really enjoyed watching OPM, and I can't wait for season 2! I think that those who especially enjoy watching comedy anime, or the likes of superheroes anime would love this fun-filled action show. Or if you're just wondering whether this show is worth watching for some comedic relief, this show is worth checking out.",9,lensaamiranda

                REUPLOADED: 
You really have to watch the whole show to pass judgement on it. OP Man is an anime that goes from simply parodying Shounen to analyzing society and what it means to be a hero. This anime is not simply joke after joke, and those who are worth their anime mettle must check this show out.
Story/Character:
These two are tied together, so I'm going to just throw my entire analysis here. 
**There will be spoilers, but only to pertinent things.**
The first thing we're gonna look at is the character of Saitama himself. He is basically the end-game of every Shounen protagonist, and a deconstruction of
                  Shounen in general. He's become so powerful that he's bored with life. Nobody challenges him anymore. He's become apathetic with life. He's literally lost most of his ability to feel emotions. 
He lets the villains rant and go to full power (typical shounen fashion) to see if they give him a challenge, and then ends it with one punch. He lets the villains rant on and on about how amazing their powers are (again, shounen) before telling them to shut it.
His character evolves through the series, and only becomes more and more likable. He goes from a jokingly overpowered to...well, he doesn't change there.
His initial motivation for registering as a hero is to gain recognition for what he's done for everybody. But as the series goes on, we see that he's happy to throw his popularity under the rug in favor of doing the right thing. He loudly disregards the crowd's opinion of him, finding it idiotic that they have all this time to hate him. He acts like a jerk to give credit to the other heroes who actively risked their lives to try and stop a monster.
He is one of few genuine heroes in this whole series, despite there being a whole organization of them.
But he doesn't get a happy ending. In the finale, he easily defeats an alien emperor named Boros who had conquered the universe until he was bored of it. Essentially, Boros is a weaker, evil mirror of Saitama himself. He had moved throughout galaxies to get to Saitama, just looking for a good fight. 
During their fight, there are numerous parallels between Boros and Saitama in his dream back in episode 1. In both situations, the person had finally found someone who they can go all out against. Boros is insanely happy at finally being able to do so, and you can hear his joy in his voice as he unloads all he has. Unfortunately, Saitama is bored and ends the fight with a punch that has some weight behind it.
As Boros lies on the ground dying, he lets Saitama know that he could tell that he still wasn't going all out. Boros never stood a chance, it wasn't even a battle. His parting words to Saitama were essentially ""you're too strong for your own good"". Saitama doesn't respond and just walks away. He'll probably never find an opponent strong enough to challenge him. He's never going to find the battle thrill that Boros managed to find at the end of his life. It was an incredibly powerful scene that highlights just how lonely Saitama really is at the top.
The next character we'll look at is Genos. He's basically the typical Shounen protagonist. He has a dark past that traumatizes him, and he vows revenge and wants more strength to exact said revenge. His design is also incredibly cool.
His character isn't only there as a foil to Saitama. It's also there as a commentary on public perception. When he and Saitama first register with the Hero Organization, he gets a ton of fan mail even though he literally hadn't done anything yet. Why?
Because he's an S-rank hero and he looks cool. Thus, the public assume he's an amazing hero regardless of accomplishments. 
His character also evolves as the series goes on, going from being fixated on revenge to becoming more of a hero, thanks to him constantly witnessing Saitama's heroics. In the final episode, he sees a ruthless hero murdering a bunch of enemies who had surrendered already, and notes that he could have turned into that person if he hadn't met Saitama.
The third character we have to look at is Licenseless Rider. He's the embodiment of a real hero, and resembles Saitama pre-training personality wise. Saitama recognizes him as a real hero, because they're so damn similar. One key difference, however, is that Licenseless Rider actually gets recognition for his work, and has a decent fanbase despite being basically a dude on a bike, through sheer force of personality and will.
His role in the serious arc is a deconstruction of a typical anime trope: the one where the hero, through sheer determination and the ""strength of the people who believe in him"" can bridge a power gap and somehow beat the villain. It looks like it would happen here too somehow. He gives a speech that shows his pure heroic personality, and brings the people on his side. They start cheering for him, putting all their faith in him...and then he gets taken out of the fight instantly. Reality ensued.
The other heroes all get their moments as well. Every hero in the show is portrayed in a very human way. One shits his pants, literally, when he meets an opponent he can't win. Another hero tries to help, but realizes he's basically useless compared to another hero. A group of heroes refuse to fall back and find another strategy because they know their strengths, and they have nothing but brute force to rely on. Even the most hateable hero has a point that you can agree on despite him going about it in the most dickish way.
Now we take a look at the themes. There are three I want to touch on.
The first theme is society's tendency to build people up to knock them down. This is true in real life as well. We make celebrities immensely famous, but still delight in secret gossip and scandalous happenings until eventually, the celebrity can't take the pressure of having his/her every move being watched and just fades away. We expect famous people to be perfect, and delight in proving that they aren't.
The same thing happens in One Punch Man. Slightly exaggerated like most animes, but still. The straightest example of this is when an S-rank Hero fails to stop a monster (the top rank), the media immediately denounces him as a failure the next day. You can see it affecting him immensely.
Another example would be after Saitama destroys a world threatening meteor, but the public instead blames him for property damage from the debris. However, Saitama challenges these views and calls them out for the BS selfish asses they are.
A third example would be that one asshat in episode 9. Words cannot properly describe how angry I am with that sack of baboon shit. Watch for yourself.
The second major theme is a question: what is a hero? The vast majority of the heroes in this show are selfish. They became a hero to become popular and possibly hit it big. The higher rank a hero is, the more popular they become.
There are heroes in this show who will actively try to discredit another hero for publicity, heroes that don't care about other heroes unless they're a certain rank, heroes who even sneer at being heroic unless it suits them properly.
Yet, during the first serious arc of the show, we see just what being a hero means. There's a hero who tries to build his fanbase by giving his rank and name before going in for a fight, but gets demolished. There are other heroes who are high rank and try to fight the monsters off, but end up getting annihilated.
At the end of the day, though, it's the people who stand up and fight no matter what who are the heroes. As the amazing Licenseless Rider says, ""If the Heroes run and hide, who will fight?"".
A third theme is public perception. The main reason Saitama isn't immensely popular and known for his deeds is because of his appearance. He's basically always slouched over with an 'idgaf' face on, and his lame costume certainly doesn't help. When he displays his power, people can't quite believe that he did it, and accuse him of being a cheat. He simply doesn't have the charisma or appearance to garner much respect from anyone.
Yet, when Genos became a hero, he instantly develops a fanbase. Lamewads like ""Tank Top Tiger"" end up being much better known just because he looks more the part. The public practically always sides against Saitama just because of his appearance.
Doesn't this mirror our society in a way? The more attractive looking people get a warmer reception, while the uglier/plainer ones have to work harder. Say what you want, but this is basically a proven fact.
Tying into the public perception theme is how popularity affects said perception. The most successful heroes are the most popular ones. Nobody quite acknowledges the lower ranked ones as much, and they eventually fade into obscurity. It kind of mirrors the manga/comic industry. Only the popular ones will continue getting printed and milked to death, while the less popular ones will get cancelled no matter how quality they are.
I doubt I've even managed to cover everything, and I don't think I even properly conveyed the things I did go over in the damn essay I just wrote. This show references so many things that it makes the head swim.
Art:
I have not had the fight scenes of an anime impress me this much since Kill la Kill. The other notable part of this show is the famous 'idgaf' Saitama face. It's hilariously poorly drawn compared to the rest of the show, and depicts his attitude towards life extremely well. His posture also noticeably changes along with the art style when he's pumped up/serious. The art will warp stylistically in the middle of a battle. And the way they depict Saitama's one-punches. Dear lord, they're amazing. Overall, just pretty damn amazing overall.
Sound:
The music ramps up at the appropriate times, and the voice actors are pretty damn good. Genos's battle theme in particular is memorable. That's all I have on this.
Enjoyment:
Even if you don't dive into the crazy amount of themes in this show, you will find enjoyment on the very surface. This show has tons of heart and personality, enough to keep you engaged throughout the whole thing.",10,klinestife

                This anime is by far one of the best of the year 2015. Convincing through story, characters, animation, music and comedy, Madhouse delivers with their adaptation of the manga once again.
What can you expect of this anime? Great comedy, a parody of clichés and a fitting animation style, that's similar to GTO and Prison School. What can you not expect going into this show? Balanced battles. But without further blabbering, I'm going to say some words about the story.
Saitama, also known as the OPM, is our way too strong and bored main protagonist, who is looking for strong enemies. Unfortunately he doesn't find any in
                  his normal life. Soon after that he joins the Hero Association and is faced with additional problems and meets enemies worthy (or not) of his presence. While that sounds like an outright 0815 story, that anybody could think of, it isn't. The Hero Association has its own internal complexity. And society is also a pain in the ass like in real life. Most importantly, Saitama's strength also switches the focus from battle to story and comedy.
Even though the story is good, it's still not the best out there. But it has a lot of potential with more seasons, because there are a lot of topics, that could be covered, like the #1 hero or the origin of Saitama's strength.
Along the story a great set of characters is introduced, that have as much a potential as the story. Our main protagonist is not our ""work hard to win"" or ""you can do it, just train a bit more"" 0815 hero, but a lazy, unemployed one who doesn't even seem like he could defeat a B-class hero. He is more normal than you would think. Despite of that he has clear goals and a defined personality, that's shown in the 12 episodes. Genos, our good-for-nothing, is Saitama's self-proclaimed disciple. He seems more like a 0815 hero, but his personality luckily develops and isn't as 2D as in the beginning. The other characters, that are introduced, are either over-the-top or as 0815 as they could be. But nobody cares, because they're exploited for the comedic aspect of the show.
Now a few words about the splendid animation and sound/music, for what Madhouse is known for.  They keep a constant level of animation throughout the story and attract the eyes with almost flawless animated scenes and well used special effects. And don't forget the comedy art style. It's so funny to watch Saitama's ridiculous faces and reminds you of other great comedy anime such as Prison School or GTO. It fits too well to the comedy aspect and thus it earned my respect.
As well as the animation the music also shines in this anime. The opening and ending is really catchy. While the opening prepares you for the magnificence of the anime, the ending sums up your feelings at the end of the episode: ""I want more!!!"". The music used in the episodes is also good, but not too noticeable. And don't forget the vocal actors. Without them the characters wouldn't have the voices, that totally hit the topic of the anime.
One Punch Man does an outstanding job at using the clichés, that are used in recent anime and manga, to create a great parody. Not only does the art style assort well with the comedy, but the story and the characters are used properly to complete this anime. I enjoyed every episode and would be happy about a second season.
However, there are also flaws. The story is not very complex and original as it relies heavily on the entertainment. If you analyse it at deep levels, you could say, that it's pretty average. Fans of deep and thrilling stories aren't satisfied by this level.
The battles are another downside. As tense as they may seem, you're able to predict the outcome right away. So battles with an unexpected outcome can't be found here. But they're flashy, so if you don't mind predictable fights and just want to enjoy the comedy, then you can ignore it.
One Punch Man may not be for everyone, especially not for those, who are bored after episode 2, but it's something new in the comedy genre (anime) and everyone, who wants to lighten up their day after a hard workday, won't be disappointed.

                One Punch Man tells the story of Saitama, a hero capable of defeating enemies in just one punch.
Story:
One Punch Man starts out with a curious premise for its story. How can an anime about enemies dying in one punch be any good? Well, in the case of OPM, it simply is. The anime blends humour to its plot extremely well, making the initial premise be possible to achieve. Yet, when you go deeper than the funny surface, you will find the plot surrounding the heroes association high echelons to be full of mystery and intrigues. This mixture of fun plot, and good quality plot makes
                  it so OPM has an above average story compared to its genre. But still, due the nature of the anime, the plot is still relatively simple. Overall, the story achieved its goal, and went a bit further beyond by introducing interesting intrigues inside the hero association. 
8/10
Art:
Animes are first and foremost animations. Some animes simply can not explore the full potential of animation if they are without fights and conversation centric. This is not the case of OPM. OPM delivers the best the anime industry has to offer. Intricate fights full of magnificent special effects are present in OPM since the beginning to the end. There is simply only one rating I could give here.
10/10
Sound:
Likewise, the sound on this anime is on point. Visual special effects often come with sound effects. The soundtracks were also very good and catchy, and got us hyped whenever they needed to.
9/10
Characters:
I highly rate characters when they are well developed, or when they are highly charismatic, or both for the highest ratings. I think it is not a mystery here that the characters of OPM are extremely charismatic. All main characters and S heroes have a unique feel to themselves. Which is precisely what characters of this genre of anime are supposed to achieve. However, some characters have extra depth added to them. Mainly Genos and some of the other heroes, and Saitama to a certain extend. All in all, the characters in OPM are extremely charismatic, while having some character development in some cases.
8/10
Enjoyment:
OPM is the anime I looked for each week. I liked its humor, all the fights, and story. The hype was real. I understand this is a personal preference, but OPM was the best anime I watched in awhile. 
10/10  
Overall:
OPM brings the best of the anime industry. The best animation I've seen in anime is here, the fights are excellent, the story is funny with some complexity, and characters are memorable. Eventually, I will forget about most anime characters, but I will not forget about Saitama for awhile. One Punch Man delivered a memorable experiences, and is one of the best animes out there.

                One Punch Man is a show that has one joke and theme that is only entertaining in the first two episodes. If you are into the ""meta-animeverse"" and are interested in parodied tropes then go watch this. Heres the joke, one punch man wins every battle without trying. Fun for an episode or two? Sure. A whole 12 episodes is rough. This show really didn't need a second season. The rest of the characters I barely even remember, but just know that they are one-dimensional parodies of tropes in anime. 
This anime is a gimmick and its not a gimmick that is possibly entertaining after
                  the first few episodes. Atleast its original.

                If you haven't been on any social media page in a while or talked to a person who likes anime, you may have not heard almost everyone talking about how good this show is. Now that I've seen it though, the show really does live up to its hype (unlike a few other ones). This show did a perfect job in each genre it was representing, the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat while the comedy scenes had me laughing pretty hard. 
CHARACTERS:
The characters are well thought out, and their personality is pretty straight forward. Some of the heroes in the
                  show will make you want to laugh, and some will be serious to the situation and actually be pretty cool. There's really not much else to say about the characters other than they're just good.
STORY:
The main story of this show follows our main hero as he kicks the living shit out of the baddies for fun. Then after a few episodes of getting to know the main protagonists they decide to team up with an organization of other heroes. I'm going to leave it at that though, I don't want to spoil anything to the people who haven't seen it yet.

One Punch Man is probably the pinnacle of shounen anime. And before Goku/Superman fanboys get on my butt by saying Goku or Superman is stronger, let's get this straight.
Saitama is meant to be a parody character. He's suppose to be the embodiment of all the plot armor/ protag hacks that occur in all shounen anime. Trust me, if Goku wasn't the main character and becoming Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, he probably would have died in like three episodes. The idea of Saitama is that he kills everything with one punch, so please, let's respect this idea and leave the fanboy argument.
Now that that's
                  out of the way, One Punch Man is definitely a new addition to the shounen series. Yeah, it's pretty much full blown shounen from the get go, but the idea of a totally average human being with no enhancements and no dark back story becoming so overpowered is completely new. Saitama's just this guy who goes around in a yellow jump suit rescuing people as a hobby but get's completely annoyed when people start to idolize him. He just wants to live a quiet normal life catching villains. Then our cyborg hottie Genos pops into Saitama's life and they become hero buddies! Fighting crime and all that jazz.
But if you look a little under, you can see the author included aspects of social media and different types of people that exist in the world. Noob crushing, public shaming, hate letters, One Punch Man has got it all. Of course Saitama being Saitama, he just brushes them away like a fly, but it still doesn't change that those sort of people exist. It kind of comments on our society like that.
And seeing as Mad House animated it, I was actually kind of scared to see how it would turn out. Honestly, Tokyo Ghoul didn't exactly have the best animated fight scenes and One Punch Man, which is all about fight scenes, wouldn't really seem like something Mad House would do. But I guess they got extra funding or what with the success of their recent animes, because the fight scenes were pretty good. There were little awkward moments and when the tension needed to be pumped, it was pumped in all the right places. Definitely a move forward for Mad House. I give it a thumbs up.
One Punch Man is a must watch for old and new watchers. It's cynical comedy and action packed animation will definitely make you laugh and impressed. Can't wait for season two!",10,Minster122

                Looking at the ratings for One Punch Man, most may agree that it is probably one of the best animes for Fall 2015 but there are still some who feel that it is over-hyped. 
So, here is my review on One Punch Man, which will be kept spoiler-free as possible. 
Story: 8/10
One Punch Man is a parody of most shounen anime - where the main protagonist usually gets defeated and trains to become more powerful. But in One Punch Man, Saitama kills his enemies with . . . ONE PUNCH. Poking fun of anime tropes is what makes the story great, despite its rather simple
                  plot. However, it can get rather predictable over time because the viewer would know how the episode would end - the villain getting defeated by Saitama. 
Art: 10/10
MADHOUSE strikes again! 
The art is amazing and some scenes are so well illustrated, leaving deep impressions on the viewer. The art is suitable for the fast-paced action of the show. 
Sound: 9/10
ONE PUUUNCHH!  
One Punch Man's opening gets you hyped up for the episode and is really catchy too, I find myself humming the tune of the opening 'The Hero'. Voice actors whom I think did an amazing job would be Aoi Yuuki (Tatsumaki), Yuki Kaji (Sonic) and Ishikawa Kaito (Genos), who brought out their character's personalities. 
Character: 9/10
Characters were diverse, with different personalities. Even the villains who appeared for only one or two episodes were unforgettable. The heroes are quirky, from the Gandalf/Dumbledore-like Silverfang to the bratty Tatsumaki. Saitama and Genos are rather unique characters. Although Saitama is the main character, Genos seems to have the 'Protagonist' vibe with his serious nature. Both are opposites - Saitama being a bored, laidback individual and Genos being a more serious character with the quest for revenge. Characters in One Punch Man bring out the story and are one of the factors that I think that make this series so enjoyable. 
Enjoyment: 9/10
Despite a few shortcomings, One Punch Man is an enjoyable show to watch and well-presented. 
Overall: 9/10
Great show and it never failed to disappoint me. It may seem overrated but it does deserve most of the hype. This is a show which I would definitiely rewatch for the humour. 
I'm also hoping for a season 2!",9,fullmetalxsoul

                one punch man is a journey a will never forget as i followed saitama an average guy who's a hero for fun who seems to have the ability to kill anything in one punch (Thus the title) but with the information given to us saitama is ""human"" and got his power by doing ""100 push-ups,100 sit-ups and a 10 kilometer run everyday"" but given saitama's power and how many times he has seem to save the world or cities a-z no one seems to acknowledge him nobody evens knows his name.
 So you follow saitama as this comedic journey of him simpily one punching everything
                  but the series would get boring over time right, Wrong this is where the second main character genos who is a blonde cyborg seeking revenge for his parents death every typical shounen plot you know after trying to become hokage or looking for the legendary treasure when genos and saitama first meet when  genos was unable to kill an enemy and saitama one shots it genos is shocked by saitama power and insist on becoming his discple.
 So what i don't like is genos plays the role of the punching bag just to show you how strong these monsters are before saitama kills them in one punch that is my only overall problem and the fact that it ended given alot of manga material was left unadapted.  
if you didn't know one punch man was origanlly a poorly drawn web comic before re-drawn into a manga but everyone is saying that one punch man is the saveur of anime when anime never needed to be saved just look at all the great series that came out this 2015 was outstanding.
Final Verdict: One punch man is a fun light hearted series but it can be serious when it wants to it goes funny to serious real quick but it's really a parody of every mainstream shounen if you watch this series there are references left and right this series really is amazing there nothing else i can say without spoiling so i highly recommend you check it out.",10,one_punch_hokage

                One Punch Man(OPM) is a parody on every shounen you've ever seen and most likely anime of the year 2015. The protagonist, Saitama - hero for fun, will face off with your usual shounen antagonists and although the outcome of every fight is hinted at in the shows name you will still be on the edge of your seat.
OPM holds an overall high quality, especially the animation, with the exception being the soundtrack that can feel somewhat meek compared to other shows such as Kill la Kill or Parasyte. Indeed, the best part of the OST may very well be the OP. However, the shortcomings
                  of the OST are compensated for by the shows implementation and timing of it, and OPM does manage to enhance certain moments in the show through this.
If you like me have seen far to many shounen with the classic DBZ power struggle(Bleach, One Piece, etc etc) you will find OPM to be a refreshing break filled with laughs and epic visual moments.",10,points

                Story: Not the focus. The anime makes the spectator know well how the world works. Many characters have fast paced story told for them, just to give flavor to the character, which works well. The main thing is humor which is very well executed.
Art: Main thing. The art quality overall is ultra impressive. Animation is just the best I have ever seen. On fights they push animation fundamentals to the limit, very well executed. I don't think I need to say much else.
Sound: Cool music, and very suitable and detailed sound effect for all little things. And very good use of sounds, giving impact to
                  the action scenes.
Character: There are a lot of superheroes, everyone with a well defined role and uniqueness, fitting very well with their appearance.
Enjoyment: Certainly on my top 5 most enjoyed animes. For the first time on a shounnen I have seen fights dense enough to satisfy me. Less talking, less smoke fading out, faster actions. There is talking and padding out in the middle of fights, but in most cases the action sequences last at least 5 seconds. The fight on the last episode was really amazing. They have put a lot of work on the actions scenes and its really appreciable.
If you like to see action and fights amazingly animated, this is a must.",10,Linck5

                I wasn't going to write a review, but after seeing some negative reviews i feel its's necessary to tell these people that they missed the point of this anime altogether.
Story(7)
The story follows a man named Saitama who set out to become a hero for fun... and that's it. I mean there's also Genos who wants to become stronger so he take down a cyborg that destroyed his city and killed his family. Other than that this anime takes and episodic route that actually works well for its type of comedy. The comedy is hit or miss. Whenever you say something is funny, it's usually subjective.
                  So take it with a grain of salt
Art/Sound(10)
What more can i say about the art and animation being absolutely gorgeous. MadHouse did a very great job of picking the soundtrack. I also should mention that MadHouse did all this on an average budget...
Character(8)
Really from a critic's point of view, there's not much to go on for each individual character. However, in this anime you can't look at each character. It's more of the interactions with the characters that provide the comedy bits. That is where you'll find a majority of your enjoyment...
Enjoyment(10)
One Punch Man is one of the most enjoyable anime i've seen in awhile. For me, the comedy was a hit every time. 
Overall(9)
This anime isn't meant to be taken seriously. Again i'll say the comedy is a hit or miss. Whether it's enjoyable is entirely up to you. If you haven't decided to watch it for some odd reason, give it a try. I think it's worth the chance",9,Anime4Rays

                Overview: Ahh, One Punch Man. With any show attaining this level of popularity, there are bound to be reviewers and people who deride the show, and are overly critical for the purpose of appearing ""different"". While I wouldn't consider myself a fanboy, I certainly cannot see the reason for many of the complaints that people have, and I read them as impartially as possible. I went into this show not expecting a lot. However, watching even the first few episodes with an open mind, I was blown away by just how good this anime truly is. I went from being skeptical based on its description
                  to a show that I would count among my favourites. 
Story: Initially, the show appears just to be a parody of shounen battle series. Had OPM just stuck to the formula of Saitama just annihilating everything in one punch, I would have been disappointed. The layering of the story with the introduction of Genos and the Hero Association and the sort of commentary it makes about the substance of heroes is where OPM truly shines. 10/10.
Art: The art of this show is magnificent. The show is vibrant, and all the characters look great. Making Saitama go from MS Paint-tier to incredibly well drawn is a bit of a gag, but it isn't overused to the point that I found it irritating. The landscapes and the animation are phenomenal, and there really isn't anything I would want changed. 10/10.
Sound: The sound gets the job done, but the OST is not phenomenal. There were no truly memorable tracks. The sound effects are done quite well, and the voice acting is great. 10/10.
Character: The characters are beautifully drawn and animated, and I enjoyed the incredibly large and colourful cast of seemingly over-powered heroes. 10/10.
Enjoyment: This show is fun to watch. The animation and art dazzle while the story is consistently funny and interesting to watch. Every week I would look forward to watching Saitama and Genos embark on their crazy exploits. There was nothing about this show that really annoyed me or raised any flags, it was enjoyable the whole way through. 10/10.
Conclusion: One Punch Man, although being incredibly divisive about the quality of its parody and many claims of it being ""overrated"" provided me with a show that I personally really enjoyed. If you're tired of filler and poor and repetitive cliches in shounen anime, I would highly recommend One Punch Man for an enjoyable and lighthearted watch. If you're craving a show that is funny yet still provides enough seriousness for hearty contemplation of its themes and issues, One Punch Man delivers on those fronts with ease and finesse. Overall: 10/10.",10,th_mnmlst

                It has been a long time since I've been this hyped about an anime. Ironically, having never read the manga, I was skeptical about it before it aired and expected it to be full of boring fight scenes and drab characters. How wrong I was though!
This anime really has it all, which is what erased any doubts about it in my mind as soon as I saw the first episode. The use of different art styles is great, there are a huge variety of unique characters to love or hate, the humor is spot on without seeming overdone, and the fight scenes were brilliant and
                  exciting! 
If you're looking for a thrilling but funny anime, watch this! You won't be disappointed.",10,Tettsui

                Have you watched Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter, Bobobo, Kinnikuman, Fullmetal Alchemist? Then don't bother with this one. Nothing new, not really done any better. If all you have ever watched are shows with completely serious super heroes, then sure, you'll love OPM.
This wasn't more interesting than HxH, and neither was it more random and funny than Bobobo and Kinnikuman, it was just overall shallow. As I watched OPM, I felt as if had already seen it all before (and not that it was so great the first time that it was worth doing it again).
Since you can never take seriously any of the characters,
                  when they do stupid shit you are already expecting it. The jokes are not especially good, and the story is simple as can be.
The art and sound were well done, but destroyed cities, fights and fire have been beaten to death for long. Lots of better anime out there.",6,cosarara97

Highly enjoyed it, highly recommend it.
Art is immense, this was not just a Madhouse production but freelance talent from different studios bringing their own skill and passion to animate it.
The OP is on point, JAM project really fitted the theme and premise.
Characters are on point, their voices, looks, character.
The BGM is immense, the fights, the tracks fit perfectly for the scenes and are epic.
The story is great, original, interesting, adapted the manga intensively closely.
This Anime is an anime to be seen and enjoyed and shows the talent and passion behind every facet. Watch it now.

[THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW SO PLEASE BE GENTLE]
At first, when OPM was airing, It didn't pick my interest, I wasn't planning to watch it, but on sites like MAL, Hummingbird, Kissanime, Masterani etc. OPM was very appreciated, and very well rated. Everyone was like ""Best anime ever"", ""Anime of the year, 100%"", ""Finally anime worth watching"". I was so excited, and decided to wait until the last episode so that I don't need to wait every week for a new one. I excepted huge team fights between Heros and Villains, where on verge of defeat MC jumps in, and
                  defeat all enemies with single punch, like a BADASS, but instead of Heroes vs Villans, we have Saitama vs Villains, where he kills opponent with one punch and End the day(sure fights are cool, and animation is Godlike, but it's boring, and it isn't funny as they thought it would be, at least not for me). In every episode there is a new Nemesis that is cocky as fuck, and thinks that he is the Main dick of all Villains, and every one of them gets killed by Saitama with one punch(I know that name of anime is ""ONE PUNCH MAN"", but it isn't funny). As for Saitama, well he is one of Gods blessings. There is not much to tell about him, he is strong, very strong, too strong, one of strongest anime characters ever, he is bald, he isn't very smart, he doesn't care for anything(except bargain day at the supermarket) because he is strongest, he is poor, and he is looking for worthy opponent. There is Genos, another very cool character, he is android and Saitamas friend. There are few other characters that I liked, but I decided to mention only MCs. Animation and art are EPIC and BEAUTIFUL. I personally didn't see an anime with better animation and art except Fate series. Battles are Godlike(I hate when Saitama fights, because he is screwing with his opponents for a while, and kills them with one punch afterwards), I especially enjoy Genos's fights even tho he always lose a big fight, I really love to see him firing flames(they are well animated, beautiful, and detailed). Soundtrack is good, and it really gets you hyped for battle, but you can only enjoy this anime when you watch battles. When they are not fighting, they are just screwing around, trying to be funny, but fail badly. That's all from me. I hope I was from any help, but if I wasn't, sorry for wasting your time.",5,KrulTepes

                An amazing action-comedy that parodies shounen anime tropes, explores depression and the search for fulfillment.
At a first glance, One-Punch Man may seem like the type of anime that will solely focus on telling it's one titular joke over and over again in slightly different scenarios until it bores it's audience to death. Fortunately, this is not the case, because as it turns out, this show is an excellent action comedy that explores the themes of depression and fulfillment in the modern-day and that parodies the most cliched aspects of the battle shounen genre.
If we are going to talk about OPM we might as well start
                  with arguably the best aspect of the show, the characters.
The cast members of OPM are quite the diverse bunch, composed by a little bit of everything, from giants, to cyborgs, to samurai, to kung-fu masters, to delinquents, to dinosaurs, to aliens, to sea creatures, to mosquitos, to espers and everything in between. all of their designs are striking, chock-full of personality and very distinct which characterize all of perfectly and make them very memorable.
The way they are written is just as great, especially the heroes and the villains.
A common thing in superhero fiction is that the confrontations and the moral compasses of ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"" are normally portrayed in a very black and white manner with the heroes always being bastions of good values and morals and the villains as just evildoers who are evil because they have nothing else better to do which typically doesn't make for the most engaging or substantial story. OPM doesn't slump in this pitfall, showing us a society filled with corruption, jealousy and excessive ambition caused by the industrialization of the hero occupation where most heroes only care about raising in the ranks and acquiring fame and recognition by any means necessary with the idea of actually saving people always being treated as an afterthought.
But amid this corruption, true heroism still exists in a few people, who convey very important heroic values to the audience, which is something I always appreciate anime.
From these true heroes, the most noteworthy of all of them would be the MC Mr. Caped Baldy himself Saitama.
The hero for fun and profit is a pretty unique character in the way that most action shounen protagonists don't start as unemployed and depressed salarymen who have lost all of their drive, passion, and interest in the world around them. but this passion is rekindled in an instinctive moment of heroism triggered by his heroic values, where Saitama saves a young boy from certain death and after the fact decides to follow his childhood dream of being the greatest hero. he trains like crazy for 3 years straight under a grueling training regime. so grueling in fact that it led to him becoming the world's strongest hero gaining absurd amounts of strength, durability, stamina, speed, and reflexes. he also kinda lost all of his hair. but to gain such a godlike physique, another godlike feature must be sacrificed. R.I.P Saitama's hair.
But even after becoming the world's strongest human ever, Saitama continues to be depressed, feeling as though his emotions are distancing themselves from him. this connects to 2 of the most important themes of the show, depression, and fulfillment. Why am I saying this you ask? let me explain. even though Saitama reached his dream of becoming the strongest hero, it didn't solve his problem, that being his unfulfilling existence. he still lives his life without giving much of f*ck about anything, since his try at being a superhero, which he tried to see if he could cure his emotional state, still left him feeling empty inside because of inability to struggle in a fight due to his overwhelming power, which leads to him not being able to feel that sense of accomplishment for surpassing a very difficult obstacle or for winning a fair fight.
These aspects of his character are used to make fun of cliched action shounen tropes like the pre-battle speech where a villain will build himself up by announcing all of his powers, titles and feats of strength while becoming even stronger in the process and because Saitama doesn't really care, he just wants his opponent to get on with it so he can see if they can bring him some type of challenge. And as the fight starts, it immediately ends resulting in a pretty hilarious moment for us and a very disappointing moment for Saitama
This starts to change, however, when a young cyborg called Genos comes into his life.
Genos is more like your traditional action shounen MC. He has your typical tragic back story (which is told in a very comedic manner) the will to punish all evildoers and the desire to become stronger. After an altercation with a villain, Genos asks Saitama to become his master to help him become stronger. After this they start interacting more with each other, which triggers a change in both of them. Genos learns Saitama's heroic values like ""if the heroes run, who is left to help?"" which both show that Saitama his a genuine hero and change Genos' attitude for the better helping him become a better hero. Another thing that their interactions bring is happiness and fulfillment to Saitama. which promotes what the show is trying to communicate, which is that what brings us the most joy in our lives isn't our personal achievements but the connections we make with other people, getting to know them, spending time with them, etc.. I ,personally, love this message because it tries to encourage us, the audience, to do the same as Saitama and spend time with the people that we care the most about or even form new relationships.
This behavior is further encouraged by the various scenes that have our characters just spending time together and chilling.
I have been talking about the heroes for a while now but don't think that the villains get any less attention.
Most of the villains are well written in the way that they are more than just obstacles for Saitama to crush, they have their ambitions, wishes, they develop through the course of the series and further explore the themes of the series. The biggest example of this is the main villain of the season, Boros who in terms of his goals is quite similar to Saitama in the sense that he is also looking for something or someone that can end his monotonous and boring life and give him the fulfillment that he so desires, but the way that each of them approaches the problem is quite different since Saitama waits for an opportunity to fill the gap while Boros goes looking for it at the expense of everything else, making them foils of one another. This subplot is even used to comment on the nature of prophecies in literature, more specifically anime, where the protagonist and the antagonist are destined to fight each other in a battle for the ages, which gives Boros hope that someday his existence will feel complete, but the fight ends with Saitama, unsurprisingly, defeating Boros in an impossible match where even though Boros was able to use the full extent of his powers and give his all, satisfying himself at the moment, he ended the fight feeling unsatisfied since he never had a chance of achieving success, which made the fight completely void of any tension or that feeling of accomplishment that Boros desired so much. The same can be said of Saitama, who also left the fight feeling unsatisfied and, to add insult to injury, was unable to use a big part of his power feeling even less accomplished. This plotline did an amazing job of humanizing Boros which I enjoyed.
Some of the other villains were also very interesting because of the way they interact with Saitama. Villains like Sonic, Hammerhead, and Genus (The scientist) try to justify their actions with your typical shounen antagonist motivation like fighting for just causes (social injustice, evolution, and honor) but when these come in contact with Saitama, who is relatively pure with his intentions, sees right through these charades and brings out their true feelings which turn out to be as pure as Saitama’s which I found to be very interesting since it also has to do with the theme of fulfillment. I think that is enough discussion about characters. Let’s talk about the story.
The story in terms of complexity is quite simple so far with not that many things happening as of now but it does do a great job of planting the seeds for coming character arcs and plotlines, some in a pretty obvious way and others in a more subtle manner.
But what I liked most was the social critique aspect of the narrative, which does a great job of condemning various parts of Japanese society like it’s mentality of “work, exist only as a cog in the machine and forsake any personal interest or dream”. These thoughts are expressed in a scene where a newsreader asks an “expert” as to the why the amount of unmotivated young people has been rising and the “expert” states that it is because of the influence of irresponsible song lyrics that motivate the populous to follow their dream, instead of its unhealthy mentality of only acting for the whole. This shows the disconnect between the old generation and the young generation. Another aspect that OPM criticizes is the ungrateful nature of the population towards heroes who are unable to perfectly fulfill their roles due to hardship, focusing only on the bad side of their results and immediately calling them useless and incompetent. This is probably one of the aspects I admire most about One Punch Man since these kind of problems are ones that should be treated with utmost importance and making more people realize these problems is essential to the process of resolving them.
Ok, that is it for the story, now let us talk about the animation and the visuals.
Without a doubt, one of this show's best aspects is the animation. Every episode is filled with expertly drawn and animated action set pieces and character animation which gives the show an extreme amount of entertainment value for everyone who enjoys a good fight or something that is just a pleasure to look at. The backgrounds may not be super original but all of them are detailed and without any noticeable mistakes.
The sonic aspect of this anime is also great with a bombastic soundtrack created by Makoto Miyazaki, having a great variety of rock, electronica and orchestral tracks that fantastically elevate the hype and emotional moments. The sound design is great with it feeling very punchy, massive and impactful. The voice cast also did a great job with solid performances by everyone be it the main or support cast.
To conclude, I would say that a greatly enjoyed OPM from start to finish and that from now on I’m gonna start reading the manga.

                One Punch Man features this crazy workout introduced by the main character Saitama. To prevent spoilers, I will not give details of the workout. Anyway, I tried the workout and now have rotator cuff tendonitis. So word of advice. Do not push yourself through his workout, unless you’re physically able. If you decide to watch the anime, watch each episode through to the previews. There’s a short scene after the credits. Now onto the review.
Based on the famous webcomic by One (yes, his alias is One), One Punch Man has a simple plot: the protagonist defeating enemies with one hit. He is bored, looking for
                  worthy opponents of being a challenge for him. As a fan of the manga, Madhouse met my expectations as they usually do with adaptations. The pacing was good, as they kept the story going by eliminating the side stories in the manga. It resembled a classic ‘90s superhero show consisting of monsters and heroes with phenomenal sakuga. 
Keep in mind before investing your time in this show that it is a parody. Do not expect seriousness throughout the 12 episodes. It is a silly gag comic about a superhero who always wins but is very unpopular among the community. If you had bad experiences with parodies, do not disregard One Punch Man. I disliked some parodies like Cromartie High School and had a fun time watching this show. Some parts, including the repetitive punchlines emphasizing on Saitama’s superpower and foolishness, may not appeal to you. There are other comical fragments to look forward to, especially the characters’ dialogue and side jokes. It may not make you laugh, but it is still entertaining and dynamic with its concept. To be quite honest, I can’t imagine getting bored with this show. With that being said, it is easy to misplace your expectations.
Why do some people dislike One Punch Man? I had an opposite experience from those individuals. It is true some people will not find this funny or entertaining at all. I will admit that some jokes are introduced early on and become predictable. No amount of visuals or good animation can amount for that. One Punch Man also presents a general punchline throughout the show, emphasizing Saitama’s superpower, foolishness, and psychological view of the world of superheroes and villains. Admittedly, this may not be the show for you, but I advise making it through at least the first 3-4 episodes. That tends to be the moment when people who are disinterested throw in the towel. 
For me, there was more emphasis on comedy in the first half and action in the second half, especially with the arcs halfway through. The dialogue and actions of the characters are hilarious as they are meant as side jokes. The monsters are eliminated, not just by one punch, but from being in the middle of a fight that doesn't involve them. E.g. After inquiring his friend’s condition, a creature was slashed immediately during Saitama and another creature’s fight. It parodies a couple of shounen tropes. The fights do not last long, allowing more enemies with exponentially high levels of power to appear. Based on the ending, One Punch Man successfully parodied the absurdities of the superhero genre. The occurrence was obvious. The ending also reached a crescendo that led me to believe there is more to the story (I’m not up-to-date on the manga). Superhero shows are hardly ever over, so I see a potential second season.
The characters were distinct, but there was not much time for character development in all of the characters. The ending introduced some major flaws in characters’ personalities that must be addressed or furthered. Saitama’s personality and mindset brought ebullience to the story. Sometimes his actions may seem unusual, but it has meaning. The majority of the monsters gave a brief introduction to their life story. Every superhero was distinct in their powers, characteristics, and backstories. I was slightly disappointed in terms of the heroes. I wanted to see the powers of all the superheroes. There was an obese superhero stuffing his face with burgers, and I wonder what could he possibly accomplish. At first, it seemed like Saitama is the only superhero saving the day, but other heroes finally had their chances, too.
“THE HERO” by JAM Project really made One Punch Man sound like your classic superhero show. I couldn’t think of a better way to get an episode started. I did not fathom the reasoning behind a love song by Hiroko Moriguchi. It did not suit the mood of the show at all. It has an assuaging sound though. Background noise (e.g. sound of rain) and music was constant and fit well with the action. I like that Madhouse knew when and when not to play background music. It made the show more enjoyable. 
The visuals were top notch. The fights have high levels of sakuga. However, the camera moved a little too much for me to fully grasp the choreography, but it still got my attention. The energy radiating from Saitama’s body when he enters superhero mode was amazing. There is not any fanservice apart from censored nude guys flexing muscles. The monsters had crazy character designs (e.g. monster crab in a diaper), but it worked. I loved the two faces of Saitama (serious baldy vs. pacified baldy) drawn all cartoon-like. It gave the show distinctiveness. Saitama resembled a Peanuts comic character when he entered a frustrated or distressed mood. There are variations in the character designs, including a bishounen character. Sometimes the atmosphere didn’t match the characters’ movements. For example, the wind blows. Saitama’s cape flows as the direction of the wind, but Genos’s hair would be at a standstill. There were little still images. The prefecture of the city, the city’s moments of destruction, and background images were well-done. 
One Punch Man knows exactly what it is and doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not. It makes full use of its potential as a lighthearted comedy parodying off the superhero genre. For that, I’m glad it didn’t take itself too seriously. I honestly did not get the references to the parody element of One Punch Man (I found out Kamen Rider was one), but I still enjoyed watching it. Madhouse has done it again!

                In a nutshell, One Punch Man is an anime about a bald guy that enjoys fisting clown looking monsters under the watchful eye of Michael Bay. This is an action enthusiast's wet dream and it does its job extremely well. However, what it does tremendously well in terms of action and stunning visuals & audio,  it lacks in terms of everything else. 
The story is simple, the world is in danger from ""monsters"". As it happens a guy named Saitama trains for 3 years straight and acquires the physique of Bruce Lee , strength of Hulk on steroids, speed of an asteroid and the
                  punching power of Mount Everest shot out of a barrett sniper rifle .  Saitama nonchalantly tears the monsters apart regardless of the situation. Big muscular Lion looking ""monster"". No problem. You try to one up this guy with a projectile? He can catch it. You're trying to run away? Check your closet, Saitama is already there. 
There is no actual limit to his power. Which can be fun seeing as no one in this anime seems to have a clue about it and the situations that arise are both comedic and bombastic in scope. However that's all there is to it. There's no character progression, no real story to speak of . No room for improvement. Just one immortal character in a sea of piñatas. So take that for what it is and you'll enjoy it. 
Visual and audio effects are spectacular. The fights will make you want to do a lot of push ups and sit ups and drink plenty of juice. Don't forget to shave your head. 
All in all, what we have here is a young Master Roshi in his hay day punching a few circus performers. Thoroughly enjoyable for what it is.

If you haven't been on any social media page in a while or talked to a person who likes anime, you may have not heard the one of the hottest animes of 2015! This anime may not look the best, but believe me when I say this show lives up to all the hype it’s getting. This show did a perfect job in each genre it was representing, the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat while the comedy scenes had me laughing pretty hard. 
Story: 10 - The story is a masterpiece without a doubt. As the title says he
                  is a man of One-Punch battle. The world building is also great. ONE has successfully imagined a world brimming with heroes and monsters that is very interesting and feels incredibly vast. There are all kinds of monsters in this show. We have monsters based on animals, monsters based off robots, monsters based off of rogue expert practitioners of martial arts, just to name a few. On the side of the heroes it's the same, we have here an incredibly diverse cast of heroes that all have very unique styles. The story pick offs from a very interesting development and the logic is crazy which makes it even better. A typical man becomes the world's strongest man in three years with only casual training and lost his hair because of it. The story’s development is great and after each episode it will having you say “One more.”
Art: 9- The art is simply amazing. The contrast between the fluid, high detailed battle scenes and the comical ones makes this show even funnier than it already is. The quality in the fight scenes are crazy and filled with colors.
Sound: 10 - Because it blends in perfectly with the anime.
Character: 10 - The characters are beautifully drawn and animated, and I enjoyed the incredibly large and colourful cast of seemingly overpowered heroes. 
ENJOYMENT: 10 - The fun is the maximum point of the series, where the blend of beautiful scenes of action, humor and music come together for the blockbuster that is the series.
Final Verdict: 10 - One punch man is a fun light hearted series but it can be serious when it wants to it goes funny to serious real quick but it's really a parody of every mainstream shounen if you watch this series there are references left and right this series really is amazing there nothing else i can say without spoiling so i highly recommend you check it out.",10,KuroHekireki

                One punch man is a truly refreshing anime that has brought new life to ONE's original manga with incredible animation, while at the same time staying faithful to the manga's story with their adaptation. 
Story- 8
One Punch man has no point A to point B story. The show follows the daily life of Saitama and how he handles the countless disasters that pop up in the surrounding cities. One Punch Man is a show that tells a new story every one to two episodes, typically along the lines of: a new enemy appears, other heros try ,but fail, to stop the enemy, Saitama defeats the
                  enemy with one punch. While this seemingly formulaic storytelling method might appear at first glance to get stale rather quickly I can tell you it does not. The reason for this is that One Punch Man is a very self aware show. They know when to use their punch line, pardon my pun, and they use it at the best possible moment to maximize the humor.
Art-10
The animation is one of the highlights of the show, Madhouse brought in some of the best animators in the business and it shows. The fight scenes look like they came straight out of Fate/zero or Bleach, with how much effort was put into them. The artstyle itself is appealing and really stands out in the character designs.
Sound-9
The voice acting is great, especially Saitama, the VA can really flip a switch between serious and apathetic Saitama.The soundtrack fits well and doesn't seem to be just copy and paste background noise, also the opening is catchy
Character-9
The characters themselves are rather simple in design however, they are unique and relatable.
Enjoyment-10
One Punch Man is one of the best action/comedies I have seen in awhile, with humor reminiscent of gintama and action scenes as fluid as Bleach I look forward to seeing a second season in the making. I highly recommend watching OPM for a truly enjoyable experience.- 9/10.",9,Shota--Kun

                One Punch Man is a very Enjoyable anime it follows the story of a Part Time Hero (Official Hero as the story goes) Called ""Saitama"" Its not how he became hero its after he become hero . he always lived a ordinary life what is called ""Average"" wanted to become hero now he is a hero but now he is to powerful so his One Punch is enough to defeat a Monster or Bad Guy so he is bored of his life again . And Here a met a Cyborg called ""Genos"" Who was amazed by Saitama's power and became his disciple and he is
                  the only one now who truly knows Saitama's power (Except Bang Who is a Very Powerful Hero) other than them everyone call Saitama a ""Cheater"" , ""Bald Bastard"" and call his power a fluke . Because of this One Punch thing this anime and manga is called ""One Punch Man"" . To be honest I like anime with a Overpowered MC and Super Powers and this anime have them both so this a perfect anime for me . I hope they make a second season of this cause so many things are unsolved anyway I am pretty sure you will like it .
Story:-
The story is good but is becomes kinda predictable after 3-4 episodes so some might not enjoy it but to me it is great and how he defeats his enemies with one punch is also very predictable but i enjoy it no matter how strong the enemy is he only needs one punch thats kind a boring so I give the story 7/10 .
Art:-
Well I am not a artist and not good with art and sound thing but as I am a human i have some like and dislike so I think the art is great so I give 9/10 .

I thank my father every day for strong hair genes.
Many of the men in my family, especially my father’s brothers (my uncles), have lost their hair quite early on. But not my father. He’s beginning to get streaks of grey, but it’s still (almost) all there.
I myself like to keep my hair short – “five on top, two on the sides” or some such hairdo lingo – but I also only get a haircut once every five months or so. It doesn’t get long, but it gets messy. Messy enough for my father to nickname
                  me “Shaggy.”
I wait so long mostly out of laziness and partially to relish in my genetics. Saitama of One Punch Man does not have the same luxury, but what he does have is an anime that, like a fist hitting a face, leaves its mark.
STORY
As was said, One Punch Man stars Saitama, a man who can take out any foe with just a single punch. After “recruiting” his “apprentice” Genos, the flame-wielding cyborg, the anime proceeds to make due on the title’s promise.
Technically speaking, One Punch Man is a comedy. That means lots of jokes and gaffs are had. But that doesn’t do the narrative justice. Hidden behind Saitama’s huge head rests some rather clever writing.
To see this cleverness, it’s best to start from a surface level and work upwards.
Initially, the anime is about an unbelievably powerful hero. He takes down giants, flies around the city, and crushes mosquito monsters with simply a slap. Standard stuff for a superhero anime.
At this point, One Punch Man gets interesting. Instead of just being about an unbelievably powerful hero, it’s about an unbelievably powerful hero who has become so strong that he is bored with it all. Literally nobody can match him. As such, he cares more about getting to a supermarket sale than he does facing the behemoth before him.
Then the anime really starts to shine. Now it’s about an unbelievably powerful hero who has become bored with his profession and goes unnoticed. Due to his first-unregistered-then-Class-C rank, his actions are often credited to other heroes nearby. Other times, nobody even sees what he does to save them all – the final fight against Lord Boros, despite involving the moon and the separation of the atmosphere, silently drifts away like hair from a balding head.
Despite reaching this height, One Punch Man takes its narrative up one more level. When everything comes together, it’s about an unbelievably powerful hero who has become bored with his profession, gone unnoticed, and has adopted a self-imposed, anti-hero persona.
Rather than denying the claims of society deeming him a cheat or giving into their taunts or trying to convince people of his impossible strength, he pretends. He pretends to be the “bad guy.” By lying, he supports the other heroes and maintains society’s morale for the system in place.
That’s the cleverness of One Punch Man: It’s not a zero-to-hero tale but a “hero-to-zero” one. Obviously Saitama’s not an actual zero – he is literally the strongest man in the universe, and his “evil” persona is used for positive purposes. But the structure of the narrative makes it appear this way. It builds and builds and builds away from the comedy-oriented side to the more dramatic, realistic side the more the anime twists that cliché.
The big question, of course, is why? Well, the answer to this question comes from the answer to an age-old question: What makes a hero, a hero? Sacrificing one’s self for the greater good, doing what is “right” over what is right, and so on. In other words, being a hero is more than just the power, the speed, and the abilities.
And One Punch Man shows this answer through reversing the cliché. Saitama can defeat anybody with a single punch. But what makes him a hero is his willingness to carry every single negative that comes from him being, well, unbelievably powerful.
Stepping down from these thematic heights and back to that surface level, One Punch Man sees highs and lows in its comedy.
On the high end, the anime does well with small or witty jokes, like when Saitama misinterprets a sentence as a homosexual advance or when he responds with a monotone “OK.” On the low end, some jokes can carry on for a bit too long – Genos providing his background and Saitama explaining the “secret” to his power come to mind.
Furthermore, the narrative itself does have a few negatives worth noting. Some of the dramatic moments, such as the guy who calls out Saitama after he defeats Deep Sea King or the two (younger) tank-top brothers trying to humiliate him, fall flat due to their overt nature.
Even so, the narrative earns points for the way it ends. The final fight between Saitama and Lord Boros sees Saitama winning. The fight is (obviously) cool, but it is Lord Boros’s words to Saitama that are the coolest.
Their exchange indicates an intriguing detail: Lord Boros was still too weak of an enemy for Saitama. The anime could’ve made the two men equally matched (and, to be fair, the battle made it appear that way for a time). Yet, after an entire season of indestructible enemies, topping off with this literal conqueror of the universe, the anime says that Saitama’s full power has still yet to be matched.
Overall, the narrative is smart, funny, and cool. Not perfect, but executed nicely nonetheless.
ANIMATION
It almost does not need to be said; One Punch Man excels at actual animation.
The fights alone are enough to make this obvious. Huge explosions, choreographed sequences, and detailed abilities dance across the screen in a flurry of movement. But if that weren’t enough, downtime fills itself with fluid scenes, like when Saitama taps Genos on the head after taking their tiny skirmish seriously or when Saitama tries to get exact change out of his coin purse.
And while the various backgrounds are not that impressive – a dilapidated city, the inside of a dojo, etc. – the artistic direction nails it elsewhere. Fights take on many forms, from spanning entire canyons to including slow-motion segments, that increase intensity. Saitama switching between super relaxed and super serious boosts the comedy. And both the lighting and perspective are played with over the course of the season.
As for the character designs, both the heroes and the villains hold some combination of detailed, interesting, and fitting. There are too many designs to go through, but examples always help. Saitama’s unassuming garb fits both his laidback nature and hidden powers. Lord Boros’s singular eye, spikey hair, and golden armor turn him into the universe-wrecking ruler that he is. And the Deep Sea King, with his regal, jester look and his larger, aquatic look, make for quite the intimidating antagonist.
CHARACTERS
The cast of One Punch Man is not the best in the world, but they are by no means horrible. They simply rest somewhere in-between.
Saitama is the obvious person to start with. While he never officially gets nicknamed “One Punch Man” in the anime, that really is what he does. No matter who or what, he can defeat his enemy with a singular punch.
While not dumb, Saitama is not the smartest dude out there. He has difficulty remembering or recognizing people, he failed the written portion of the hero-registration exam, and he walks through life with impressive nonchalance. This last detail helps to make his actions comedic or dramatic when required. Comedy with his hidden technique “Consecutive Normal Punches” and drama when he decides to take the situation a little more seriously.
Saitama was not always the strongest entity in existence, though. He had humble beginnings; he wanted to be a superhero and not a businessman. So he trained and fought and won. Only to find that he trained and fought and won too much. So much so that being a hero had lost its charm after three short years.
This lost charm does not affect his fighting prowess. Far from it. In fact, it may have helped since his carefree attitude tends to give him an element of surprise against his foes. Nevertheless, it makes him question what he has given up personally to get to this point. Sadly, this question never truly gets explored.
What defines Saitama, however, is not his powerfulness or his silliness – it’s his willingness. His willingness to be the hero he needs for everyone else, sacrificing fame, pride, and glory in the process. That is, he becomes the “bad guy” not because he wants to but because he should. That turns Saitama from just a strong hero and into a strong person.
After Saitama comes Genos. Genos joins the fray early on, quickly flocking to Saitama’s side when he witnesses his immeasurable strength. His character serves two purposes: to remind and to support. He reminds the audience of Saitama’s power, acting as a reference given his Class-S distinction. And he supports Saitama by not just looking up to him as a mentor but also being a close friend.
Genos also has a peculiar backstory, a motive that drives him forward besides learning the secret to Saitama’s strength. In the past, a fellow robot-related enemy wronged him, and, ever since, he has been seeking to return the favor. Unfortunately, the anime puts this conflict in the back of its mind for a vast majority of the season, resurfacing only briefly near the end.
Three other characters are worth discussing: Amai Mask, Sonic, and Mumen Rider.
Amai Mask is a side character that first introduces himself to Genos following the hero registration exams. Strangely, he focuses most on the image that heroes inadvertently give off. He visits talk-shows, he complains about the failures of the higher-ranked heroes, and so on. However, his most interesting contribution to his cause stems from his refusal to move up in the ranks when he apparently can. The reason? He can weed out or prevent weaker heroes from ascending to the top tier, thereby maintaining a more polished image of heroes in general.
Sonic is also a side character, but he’s not around all that much. Not just because of his smaller status or even his speed, but because the anime did not have a place for him within the narrative. Regardless, he reveals a darker side to heroes, a more morally ambiguous one: Not all heroes want to be good. Sonic is not obligated to aid others just because he has super-sonic speed, and him caring more about proving his power (be it for money, himself, or any other “sinful” reason) proves this.
Mumen Rider is yet another side character, but he’s on the opposite end of the Class-system spectrum. As the number one Class-C hero, the people expect him to help but not a level comparable to the other, stronger heroes. He demonstrates this himself: He loses to lesser villains, he doesn’t have any special abilities, and he rides around on a bicycle.
More importantly, he knows this, too. He does not move to Class B because he understands his limitations as a hero. That’s what makes his stand against Deep Sea King so noteworthy. There’s powerful symbolism in him getting off his bike and standing up for himself, but it’s him trying and failing – highlighting that, like people, even heroes have limits – that means the most.
Now, none of these five develop over the course of the season, but that may arguably be the point. I.e., as heroes do, they each have a role to serve. Saitama sacrifices, Genos supports, Amai Mask prevents, Sonic proves, and Mumen Rider highlights. To be fair, they perform their roles well. Even so, such a theme does not get explored to any high degree.
And that’s the extent of One Punch Man’s characters. More exist, such as the evil scientist, Lord Boros, and the myriad of other heroes, but they are not looked at enough or not around long enough to be considered important to the story at hand.
SOUND
One Punch Man’s opening track designed itself to get its audience pumped up for the coming attractions, and it accomplished that goal handily enough. Each part of the piece comes together: the hard rock, the changing pace for the lyrics and tempo, and that final, stellar note sung by the singer. It’s an awesome OP that is both fitting and fun to listen to.
The ending track realizes that the OP and the anime itself may saturate the audience with adrenaline, so it chooses to go down the contrasting route. The ED is soft, starting and ending in a gentle manner while the middle gets filled with dainty tunes and instruments. In other words, the ED is meant to calm the audience down, and it works. (The OP is still better, though.)
The rest of the music and sound-effects hit their mark as well. The OST contains, like the OP and ED, both sides: hard-and-heavy plus techno tracks for the battle sequences, and laid-back plus sadder tracks for those more grounded moments. Furthermore, One Punch Man includes many different sound-effects for punching, telekinesis, lasers, swords, explosions…. Too many to list – which is certainly a positive. And as a small, extra treat, the tiny guitar riff between the A and B parts of each episode added even more coolness to the overall package.
As for the voice acting, while no impressive performances are found, a couple of people deserve a shout-out. Makoto Furukawa as Saitama sits on top, bringing to life the all-powerful, happy-go-lucky hero. And Aoi Yuuki as Tatsumaki “Terrible Tornado” annoys everybody without grating the audience’s nerves. Everyone else voiced their parts nicely but not notably.
ENJOYMENT
I can’t say I adored this one, but I liked it.
One of the obvious reasons was Saitama. One second he has that dopey look on his face, and then the next second he exudes extreme focus. This constant dichotomy of nonchalance and seriousness, like when he says he has “nothing to do” so he tags along to the Class-S meeting or when punches the praying-mantis monster’s head off while asking him to pay for his ceiling, made me laugh.
The anime also had other funny jokes. Sonic lightly getting tapped in the junk by Saitama caused the anime to go to a short “intermission” and made me chuckle out loud. Or people thinking that some evil monster lived in Saitama’s part of the city when it was actually all his (accidental) fault got a nod out of me for its cleverness.
Thinking about the characters more, one of my favorites was Tornado. She did nothing else but whine and complain, yet she was hilarious whenever she happened to be doing so. Especially because the anime changed her design from a normal one to a goofy one whenever she took her rants a bit too far.
As for the battles, I was actually not all that into any of the fights. The final fight was at least cool because Saitama finally did more than usual – which is why I am most partial to the tiny skirmish between Saitama and Genos. Even then, just the last thirty seconds of it. Saitama chooses to listen to Genos’s rules for the fight, and death follows. Okay, not quite, but the single-worded frame and Saitama’s ginormous fist made that conclusion imminent.
One Punch Man has, similar to Saitama, a lot of strength. An interesting theme for its narrative, awesome animation, and hardcore music coalesce to bring about quite the intriguing show. Some problems exist – a lack of depth to the characters, comedy troubles, etc. – but they do not fully ruin the experience. Genetically speaking, the anime won a small lottery.
SUMMARY
Story: Good, faux hero-to-zero theme creates a strong structure that is hurt slightly by some mistimed comedy and overt sequences
Animation: Great, awesome actual animation, cool artistic direction, and nice character designs
Characters: Fine, Saitama, Genos, and a few others serve their roles well but lack further depth or development

                The thing that stands out the most about One Punch Man is the uniqueness of its premise. A guy who can beat anything and anyone in a single punch. You'd think that would be boring. Yet the way it's done causes a chain reaction that makes this show completely and utterly enjoyable. This was the show that finally got me on my way to filling the show hole I had after finishing Hunter x Hunter (2011). I would still be wallowing in my pain if it wasn't for this show. It's fun, it's funny, and it's downright awesome.
The characters are fun and exciting. Saitama (One
                  Punch Man) is hilarious in his completely calm way he handles every threat, no matter how severe it actually is. Genos is a fun character to watch grow and change as he grows closer to Saitama and comes to admire him more and more. And the literal ARMY of supporting characters are basically all amazing. The bike hero, Mumen Rider, and all the villains and the S-classers are all great. Trust me.
The animation is OUTSTANDING! Every single fight scene is like a work of art. The fluidity of the actions happening on screen is simply splendid and the way the show transitions from the fight scenes to the less detailed and fluid comedy or scenes with no real movement is spectacular. Still though. The fight scenes are AMAZING! And I would be hard pressed to find a flaw in the animation of them. The OP is also pretty outstanding. It makes the show seem awesome and gives you all these images of Saitama beating things to show you how truly awesome he is. 
The comedy as well is pretty great. There are a few moments when it feels slightly forced, but never to the point where it feels like they're begging you to laugh. Mostly the comedy is flowing and natural and feels effortless, like they didn't even think people would find it funny, but it's hilarious. For example, the FLY! THE FLY! THE FLY SCENE IS AMAZING! And it makes you laugh, even though it doesn't feel like they're TRYING to make you laugh.
One Punch Man is awesome. If you have a show hole from a supreme action show (like Hunter x Hunter) it's the perfect thing to help fill it. The characters are awesome and the animation is impeccable. I highly recommend this awesome superhero parody thing of an anime!",9,Suzu-kun22

                One Punch Man is a comedy at heart. You are NOT supposed to take it seriously. This is a PARODY series making fun of what it truly means to be a superhero. Now, whether you find it funny or not is up to you!
The story is very simple and enjoyable. The beginning is a little slow but it picks up very fast and can become very intense. However, where this anime truly shines is in the animation of the fights. MADHOUSE has done it again with their seemingly unlimited budget. The execution of ALL of the character's special attacks and the overall animation of the
                  fighting sequences are beautiful.

                Story (9/10): The story is something i've never seen before, a man who has the power to destroy planets and even more plays as a hero for hobby, i think they improved in the plot, i liked the story because its funny and made me laugh sometimes, also me and my other friends who watched it can feel the hype growing in each episode.
Art (8/10): The art in the anime is great but in the manga is the greatest, some frames looks exactly like in the manga, i loved that, the final fight, tatskumaki scenes; but sometimes i didnt feel the same sensation when i
                  read the manga because they kinda remove some cool animation sequences Yuusuke Murata did in the manga.
Sound (9/10): This is it. When the characters start to get serious, when they fight and all the explosions are just like ""WOW OH MY GOD AAAAAAAA"", great soundtrack and i've seen a lot of parodies of the OPM Opening, i sang it every time y listened to it (it made me yell, too powerful), the ending theme is amazing, i listen to it and its like to listed a soft song after an epic battle. If the characters voices can be here too, i'll say they were just amazing, great job.
Character (10/10): I and many people can identify themselfs with this one, i relate too much to saimata (many people can say the same lol), Genos is a great character and his purpose to fight is cool, Mumen Rider is the best, he is the average human, but he wants to be a hero and people know he may be weak but is putting 100% of his effort bringing peace to them, Sonic is great (the seiyuu did a good job on some phrases, quotes, etc). The first time i see variety of characters like Pri Pri Prisoner, me and my dad laughed to dead.
PS: I wanted to see more Fubuki ;__;
Enjoyment (10/10): I dont think i have much to say on this one, when i see Saitama or another character doing epic fights (Mumen Rider, Atomic Samurai, Bang, etc) gave to us. I literally jumped on my bed when i saw them fighting.
I think everyone who liked it wants a 2nd season! (and waiting for the OVAS!!)",9,shoniki

                This anime is not for everyone. You're going to love it, or hate it.
I personally loved it !. I love the witty humor. A few main reasons to watch the anime : Witty humor, Visually very strong. especially the final episode.
Saitama became a hero for fun. However, he soon became too strong and hopes that one day he wil find a villain who can actually Challenge him. This results in somewhat predictable yet very funny scenario's.  This did not affect my enjoyment of the Anime because of the Character of Saitama. even the voice acting of Saitama is so Witty at sometimes.

                In a sea of absolute shit, One Punch Man stands alone as the ONLY worthwhile series this year (2015). This is not hyperbole.
The brilliance of OPM is it's ability to successfully parody every vapid shounen action anime that has flooded the market these past 20, 30 years.
It takes stale tropes, themes and character archetypes and hilariously mocks them with one seemingly simple character trait, or plot device.
To be clear about what I mean by stale trope, basically the excruciating DBZ/Bleach/etc anime trope is as follows. 
Weak hero gets beat-down. Recovers. Powers up. Battles bad guy in round 2. Wins. Season 2. Meets even more powerful
                  bad guy. Rinse. Repeat.... 
Basically, you watch one, you watched them all. 
So, what makes OPM different? With Saitama we get a hero who can literally destroy any enemy with one single punch. Fucking BRILLIANT. That sole premise throws the whole traditional action narrative structure out of whack and provides for some truly interesting scenarios.
Unfortunately, I do see bumps in the road ahead. Hopefully OPM will end with a single season. The only reason I feel this way is because I've read the manga... Urgh. Unless they rework the story (and most of the recycled humour), I don't see much future for OPM.
That said, this is a review for this current season. Not the manga and not for some hypothetical 2nd season. As such, I can only give OPM my strongest of recommendations. Watch it!
Edit: Upon reflection Sidonia no Kishi was actually fucking awesome too. And Ping Pong kept my attention (mainly for it's art).",9,mugwump

                This anime has it all - a good story a better soundtrack and even better animation and artwork.At first while getting into this anime i didnt know why was it so popular , i didnot even liked the first episode but then it just hit me, that the protagonist doesnt want to be liked at all.He is a guy who's a  Hero For Hobby and doesnt care what others think of him, atleast thats what we have been shown.
Story-------10/10
The story is pretty simple -- An overpowered protagonist who saves people for hobby and wants to fight someone real strong.We embark on a journey with
                  Saitama(protagonist) and are kept being put into crazy and humerus situations where he creates friends and enemies both good and evil.Saitama  is constantly being underestimated by others who dont know him which is pretty funny to watch as they experience his real power gradually. Its like AT YOUR FACE BITCH! 
Art------------10/10
The artwork and animation is slick . Each frame feels to be drawn with perfection and heart , fluid movements with great details. The soundtrack is well composed which adds to the excitement and enjoyment of the series.
Characters-----------10/10
The characters are the strong point of this anime. Being a character heavy anime we get to see lots of different characters with distinct personalities which are absolutely loveable.Their interaction with Saitama and also their reactions afterwards.
Overall i will say that you give this anime a try and u will be sucked into its world and will have a wonderful ride with Saitama!!",10,JaeSLash

                MAdhouse never ceases to fail us with great anime coming out every year and this title is no exception. One Punch Man is a series that is based on a Web Comic that is a parody of modern and old school Marvel and DC based superhero comics. 
This anime tells the story about Saitama, the self-proclaimed average hero trying to find stronger evil to fight. His power the ability to defeat any opponent in, you guessed it....just One Punch. The main story line is very simple and easy to follow for every viewer, new or veteran and that what makes it great. No need for
                  long drawn out explanations for everything like in most Shounen/Seinen anime. However I find it a little too predictable in most fights so do not get your hopes up for any game changers or major plot twist. There is also a lot of characters which doesn't give the anime a ton of time to go into deep understanding of its characters, including it's MCs.
The anime has a great art style which captures the comic book style artwork most people are used to. The music is also on point as well. Everything but the Ed impressed me quite a bit and are extremely catchy. Its a great aesthetic viewing experience with audio and visuals.
Overall this is a great anime for all types of viewers: newcomers casuals, elitist, etc. The action is very appealing and its also one of the funniest anime to be released this year. Its definitely a must watch for any superhero or comic book fans out there.",9,ROBO-D

                One Punch Man or OPM, was one of the most hyped anime's of 2015 and has not decline by that much in terms of overall rating from the general public. The story revolves around Saitama, a non-employed male who chooses to become a superhero for fun. This inspires many of children to become active and such in order to become like Saitama even though it's impossible. The anime takes on an unrealistic take on things. Nothing wrong with that, but sometimes logic provides to make a more exciting show. Many of people believe that the anime had and still has a lot of potential which
                  I agree with, but for now I would have to rate it an overall grade of 8. Story is developed well at the very beginning of the show, in which Saitama is searching for a strong opponent that will give him a challenge, but is hard to expand on because we know Saitama to be able to beat every villian with one punch, otherwise he wouldn't be OPM anymore. Art is good, action scenes were greatly produced and are very smooth. Sound is about average, but I gave it an 8 because the sound track fits the show nicely and are inputted during the scenes at the proper times. Character are still not too developed but that's because there are only 12 episodes and 1 OVA. There are many questions to the anime, but i do wish that they gave more insight on Geno's past for at least one episode. Enjoyment was a bit above average. I was never in too much of a rush to watch the next episode but I did enjoy them when I watched them. The comedy is satire, and the action scenes are great. This is my personal opinion of One Punch Man in which my overall rating is an 8.",8,Jintama

                The reason why One Punch Man stands out from other shounen action anime is that the story-telling is fast-paced.  It doesn't dwell on lengthy explanations through character dialogue and back story as it just goes straight to the point, which made the anime so much more enjoyable as you are always engaged throughout the show.  And to top it off, the comedy in this show especially between the main characters really adds to the enjoyment of the show. 
Story: 9/10
The story itself is just like your typical shounen action anime, no surprises there.  - Good fighting against evil.  However, as mentioned
                  earlier, the pace of the story-telling is what makes this show stands out.  You are given enough backstory and explanation to understand why things are happening - the reasons and motives behind why the antagonists are attacking etc., but it's not lengthy where some viewers can easily get bored.
Art 9/10 
The art is great considering that they were only given an average budget (so I heard).  One thing that especially stood out was the character art - both comedic and serious facial expressions of characters were drawn on point and really set the mood of the scene.  The actions scenes also had great flow to it as well and you the exaggeration of the art as certain points really makes you feel the 'impact' of the attacks (especially Saitama's one punch).
Sound 10/10
The OP song really gets you excited and hyped, and really suits the ambience of the show - upbeat and fun.  The background music as well during battles and comedic scenes, sets the tone perfectly.  No complaints there.
Character 10/10
Each and every character has their own very unique and strong personality that are very extreme to one another, which makes the characters very likeable.  Especially with the two main protagonists, Saitama and Genos, whose personalities are very different, but their interactions with each other makes for very good comedy.
Enjoyment 9/10
With everything combined - the story, art, sound and character, it makes this show very enjoyable if you are after something light-hearted with action.",9,JafaJess

                If I had to define one punch man with a serious word ""repetitive"", the series only has a joke that is repeated throughout the 12 episodes, there were already series like DB that also used this same joke, the difference of OPM and DB is that at least this series (DB) does not repeat this joke in all episodes (and before they say anything, yes, one punch man has a history Saitama search for recognition, but the plot does not advance, in the first chapter Saitama defeated his enemies easily and in the latter too.
the series is adding characters that do not contribute anything to
                  the plot, all they do is make time until Saitama comes and defeats him.
conclusion: an overrated and over-thought anime by users (cof cof talking vidya cof cof) 5/10

                One Punch Man - Overpowered For Fun.
This review is about One Punch Man, an anime featuring a hero “for fun” named Saitama for is the average as average can be. He looks for villains to defeat as a hero to hopefully be a challenge for him because, as the name states, he beats everyone with one punch. 
The story line over the twelve episodes showing many different characters and villains Saitama must battle to satisfy his hunger for a challenge all because he is bored with everyone else.
There is a lot of comedy throughout the series, not just action and over the top explosive action
                  and fights. 
The animation for this show was great for the amount of detail in the fights and destruction. 
No english dubbed is out for this series but that original voice actors were fantastic for each character.
The soundtrack that goes with the series so great. From the encouraging opening song “The Hero” by Jam Project to all of the background music during all the fight scenes. 
Overall, without giving too much in form of spoilers, One Punch Man was fantastic and showed with only doing 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and a 10km run everyday. You too, can be an over powered super hero.

                I love self-deprecating humor. When you can make fun of yourself, the possibilities are endless. Anime is no different. So, enter ""One Punch Man"". A superhero show so entertaining, it's only a matter of time before Disney buys it and tries to fold it into ""The Avengers"". 
The storyline is simplicity itself. Really powerful superhero goes around fighting the bad guys who seem to appear at a constant basis. The fun part is that he's so powerful, he really doesn't care. He's doing this for fun. And why should he care when the bad guys he's often fighting (though mildly creative) are a bunch of
                  monologue spouting villains of the week. It's a joy to see them get squished. 
The art is better than it should be for a show like this. Great amounts of bright colors, ridiculous looking villi ans and heroes, and fight sequences that so over-the-top they make DBZ look subdued and realistic. But, then again, I suppose that was all rather the point. It's supposed to be silly. Sound effects are worthy of the art quality and give a legit feel to this satire. There are many times where the art will shift from simple to more detailed in order to bring a more serious tone to the scene at hand, only to have it end in silly fashion. 
The characters carry the show. From Saitama, Mr. One Punch Man himself, and his deadpan ""yeah, bro"" attitude towards any threatening situation, to his cyborg disciple Genos who provides the straight-man to compliment Saitama's care-free demeanor, and the grocery list of villains and heroes with hilariously complex backstories and sets of powers who provide the meat of the show. Most of these characters will have you looking at mundane objects differently forever. 
The Sub vs. Dub battle is something of a wash. Both casts do a good job in their roles, which are mostly comprised of hammy performances. Makoto Furukawa suits the titular role perfectly with his voice reflecting the boredom that fits the character in Japanese. But, Max Mittelman with his trademark ""laid back teenager"" voice, does a different but equally decent job in English. A special mention goes to Miyano Mamoru, who has a crucial (but smaller) role as Amai Mask. His voice perfectly suits that character, the same voice who gave Light Yagami in ""Death Note"" that pretty-boy confidence with a touch of sinister intention, fits equally well in this role and gives a hint of what's to come. So much so, I'm giving the win here to the Japanese cast.
I enjoyed this show in much the same way I enjoyed the film ""Deadpool"". It's the right show at the right time. With so many super powered Anime shows and superhero films flooding the market even as I write these words, it's a breath of fresh air to watch a show that throws pies in both their faces. If you're like me, and you're tired of overly dramatic Anime and Superhero titles, give this one a watch. At only 12 episodes, it may be one of the most binge-worthy Anime I've seen in a long time. A great time. 9/10. Check it out. Cheers!",9,GarlandReese

                The story is basic, but very effective because of this. The main characters are lovable and relatable; despite Saitama being an incredible hero he is basically a typical poor twenty-something living in a small flat and obsessed with supermarket discounts. The comedy therefore centers around his deadpan nonchalant attitude to serious situations and the awkward struggle of everyday life, e.g. simply catching a mosquito, and works perfectly with the rest of the anime.
The animation is incredible, especially during the fight scenes. Madhouse has a great reputation for making action sequences look intense and they pulled it of spectacularly in this anime - especially for Genos.
                  The sound is amazing, you'll be singing the theme tune after a few episodes. Sounds corny, but it really conveys the sheer awesomeness of the anime as a whole. The ending theme tune is a stark contrast to the opening, but reminds you that after all the action that has happened in the episode, after a long day of being a hero, the characters still have to go back to their regular lives just like everyone else. And that's basically the show.",10,makise_kurisu_

                TLDR: The only people rating it low are those who are too ""indie"" or ""hipster"" to enjoy popular anime and are those who you'd probably find hate/underrate all of the following popular anime: Shingeki, No Game No Life, SAO (although that's actually bad) and etc.
While One Punch Man isn't the groundbreaking savior of anime that some are claiming it to be, it is still very good, and extremely enjoyable.
One Punch Man excels at what it's there for, pure unadulterated action/fighting with unique and interesting characters, thematic soundtracks, and an EXCELLENT standard of quality for its animation. 
Pros; 
Excellent fight animation quality. Like seriously that shit
                  is goooooooooood, on par with anime such as UBW remake. 
Soundtrack is fitting and adds to the spectacle, it accompanies the animation well and assists in delivering the message, making you hype when you're meant to be, making you sullen or sad when the scene dictates it.
Characters are unique and for an shonen anime, rather well developed and each have their own flavor/unique identity. Honestly the most plain and underdeveloped character is the protagonist Saitama, but that is deliberate and is part of how the show presents itself.
Con (Honestly this is the only real con)
Storyline is as you would expect, near nonexistent. There's a couple plot points introduced that sort of don't go anywhere, but that's per course of what you signed up for, no one is watching OPM for its captivating story or dramatic plot twists. We watch OPM to see ridiculous fights with supreme animation quality and an epic soundtrack going off in the back.",8,randylek

                There's always that one show that comes out every year that gains a certain level of popularity within the anime community. A LARGE amount of popularity in some cases, that creates a certain level of conflict between viewers. One half sees it as the greatest thing ever made, and the other half sees it as overrated garbage. The hype gets so big that eventually its value gets misconstrued and people tend to join sides to just join sides. One such show happens to have aired this year, and it definitely has left a lasting impression on the community.
Hi, welcome to WattheWut. This is a review
                  of the Fall 2015 anime series One Punch Man. Let's get it on!
STORY
Now, before we get into this, let me just address both sides of this show's viewership. We have the people who think of this show as one of the greatest action shows in existence, showing its brilliance of parody and satire by poking fun at typical shounen and superhero tropes while still managing to shine a new light on the genre. The other side views OPM as a horribly overrated failure of a parody or ""satire"" that relies solely on reused tropes and ""good animation"" because people sometimes shit on this show's animation just to shit on it. Well...Lord knows neither of you are...completely right. You're both only half right.
Allow me to tell you where I stand on the issue. One Punch Man is good. It is a good show. That's it though. It is at best good and at worst good. So...
Now, people were originally shitting on me for saying that OPM is just the Attack on Titan or Kill la Kill of 2015, because its hype is so overblown that it gets way too much praise than it deserves. That's not a false statement, because as of recently, One Punch Man has reached the #11 spot on MAL. People seem to think this show is better than Hajime no Ippo, Gurren Lagann, Cowboy Bebop, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, etc. That's sort of ridiculous, not gonna lie. 
Enough about that, let's get into it.
One Punch Man takes place in a world where monsters apparently appear on a whim out of nowhere and constantly threaten the safety of the people. So it's Florida. Please don't hurt me.
To combat this, various heroes fight these monsters to defend the people, each with their own unique powers and skills. So it's New York.
One hero in particular is so strong that he is able to defeat any individual with a single punch. The outwardly bland-looking Saitama has become so strong, in fact, that he has become bored with hero-ing and longs for an opponent who can actually give him a challenge.
The obvious question that comes up every time is ""if he defeats every opponent, doesn't that remove all tension?"" Well, yeah it kinda does. Knowing that he cannot be beaten and is stronger than any opponent kind of sets itself up to be predictable and boring and seems kind of pointless...though I believe that is the point.
Like, do you really walk into any superhero film expecting the hero to lose? Do you really think Iron Man's gonna lose to anyone he faces? Do you REALLY think Superman is going to lose to...well, anyone? I mean, for fuck's sake, the guy beat Goku in Death Battle twice, and the second time ScrewAttack had to make a huge event out of popular demand to tell you TO YOUR FACE that Superman cannot lose. Yet no one really complains about this.
One Punch Man's purpose is to poke fun at this fact, ending almost every conflict abruptly and anticlimactically to comedic effect. Whether this actually works is up to debate.
One Punch Man, above anything else it is, is a comedy anime. Comedy is, in general, subjective and the enjoyment of it varies from person to person. Now, yes there IS a basis from how to write good comedy, but in general not everything is going to appeal to everyone. I personally don't find Monty Python funny. It's a type of humor that I just sort of don't care for, but people view it as comedic genius. Okay. That's opinion. It's subjective. I personally find Jo Koy funny because the comedy is relatable to me and I understand where he's coming from, but I'm assuming that other people don't find him funny. Who's right?
The problem with One Punch Man's comedy is that it's a type of comedy that relies on an abrupt stop in tension. Constantly. Over and over again. I affectionately refer to this series as ""One Joke Man"" because it tends to use the same joke over and over again. The only other kind of humor is deadpan humor, wherein Saitama's reactions to certain situations as if they don't matter or taking small matters too seriously are the basis. THAT'S funny. Like, it's legitimately funny. Sort of. The problem becomes that you get desensitized to the comedy to the point where it just becomes white noise. 
Now, while most of the comedy IS subjective, there ARE instances of where it's just poorly timed. I'll expand on this at the end.
The second thing people mention with this show is the characters. I've heard from people who love the manga that the show is all about the side characters, and that they are the more interesting ones. That's funny because while watching this series, it felt like Saitama was the most intriguing character in a sea of Mary Sues because these characters are not interesting.
Saitama is actually a VERY good character. In contrast with the world he lives in, he doesn't take anything seriously. His blatant lack of motivation and deadpan reactions are possibly the only comedic moments in the show. You also come to understand why he is the way he is. It's that feeling when you play like Pokémon and you have all of your Pokémon to level 100, and you just keep replaying over and over and you just mow down opponents at ease. It's not fun. And that's Saitama.
The problem is the other characters. Genos, a cyborg with a vendetta who forces himself onto Saitama as his disciple, is introduced into the show, and in contrast with Saitama, is super serious about his job and constantly walks with a stick up his ass. He's apparently very strong, but you wouldn't know because every opponent he faces ends up being defeated by Saitama. You also don't get to know anything further about his backstory, and this wouldn't be a problem because the manga is ongoing...but this is a Madhouse anime, so there will most likely never be a second season...maybe...
The only other character I feel stood out was Mumen Rider, a C-Class hero with the ability to ride a bike without a license, also apparently Japan requires you to have a license to ride a bike. What? We're there hit and runs being done on bikes? How many horrible bike crashes clogged up the highways of the Nippon? He has no powers whatsoever, yet consistently and without complaint rides into battle...and fails. This will be explained later in the review.
The other characters in this show feel as if they're there to...be there. They don't serve a purpose other than showing how powerful Saitama is...but that would be easier if we actually had a definable level for how strong they are.
There are all of these huge threats that exist, yet because we always see Saitama wreck them in an instant, we never get a sense of how powerful they are. We see the more powerful characters fight...but they mostly lose after a drawn out fight, a fight which Saitama ends in an instant. We DO get one scene of Tornado killing a huge threat, but she's the second most powerful person in the generic league of heroes, so it really doesn't matter. We don't have a basis for what constitutes as powerful, so we just assume that everyone is just shitty at their job. They feel...pointless.
I will have to address all of these at the end of the review when I talk about theming.
In fact, that's the main problem with this show. You leave with this sense of pointlessness after every episode. You essentially feel like you wasted your time...though again, that might be the point considering Saitama's character, but it's still inexcusable.
So, if all of that is what's wrong with One Punch Man, what's good about it?
ANIMATION & SOUND
One Punch Man was made under the Madhouse flag, but was mainly animated by a bunch of freelance animators who have done amazing work on other series. They were all invited into the project by Natsume Shingo, the director of the Bones comedy Space Dandy, which, I don't know about you, looks freaking amazing. As such, One Punch Man is one of the best looking anime in the past DECADE. It's fluid, it's well-directed, and you feel the scale of just how big and powerful everything feels.
What's also notable is that One Punch Man was made on a very tight budget. I find it funny that people will try to shit on this show's animation by saying it's inconsistent, but, again, tight budget. Evangelion fans will talk all day about how amazing the animation is, despite the fact that, because of the limited budget, several lapses in quality and LARGE AND ABSURD uses of still frames throughout its runtime. Just saying.
The OST for this show is pretty good as well, though it really is just used as a backdrop and an elevation tool for the hype. This show IS hype, and the music and animation ramp it up to this degree. Really, anyone who shits on the aesthetic value in this show just really does not like this show.
Speaking of hype, the opening for One Punch Man has been slowly gaining my respect. I originally was opposed to it, as I too was feeling the annoying hype that is the OPM fanbase, but you really get to appreciate it as you watch it more. The opening is the show incarnate, extreme levels of hype and Saitama being overpowered and the other characters being there just because they have to.
Ok, here is the section of the review where I shall discuss theming, problems involving adapting it from print to screen, and the difference between parody and satire.
I have heard the terms ""parody"" and ""satire"" thrown around aimlessly when discussing One Punch Man. Most will point out that OPM is parodying superhero tropes, while some cynics will call it a failed satire... Allow good ol' WattheWut to educate you.
Parody refers to the humorous and exaggerated imitation of a certain style or work for the purpose of comedic effect. Satire refers to the use of humor to criticize or expose problems with a certain topic, mainly political. Satire is mainly used in the West, and is not nearly as prominent in anime.
People need to understand that parody and satire are not completely separate. Satire is actually derived from parody. A parody CAN include elements of satire within it, but satire, no matter what, includes elements of parody.
That being said, I have heard people criticize this show for being a failure of a satire because it ""makes fun of the tropes but uses them anyway.""
I direct you to the 2005 Kyoto Animation adaptation of the light novel series Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu, or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi was a show which was created to parody the section of anime which features high schoolers who also secretly have some sort of supernatural, sci-fi superpower thing going on, such as Shakugan no Shana and the like. However, it not only subtly mocked these tropes but also WAS these tropes. Rather than simply make fun of them, it also made the point of BEING them in order to fully embody the feeling of what those shows were and still are. It makes fun of them...but also acknowledges that and is used to sort of grow an appreciation for them.
One Punch Man is basically that but for the superhero and shounen action genres. The only way it could fully embody these tropes is to BE these tropes.
It also helps that satire is not as prevalent in Japan as it is in the West.
Also, if you are still wondering if OPM is a parody or a satire, I direct you towards the MAL genre tags, where you'll find that it FUCKING SAYS PARODY RIGHT THERE.
However, there are certain things you can't excuse just by pinning ""parody"" on it.
Flat characters and horribly timed comedy are two things you cannot just throw under that umbrella. Why? Because the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya parodies a genre of anime FILLED TO THE FUCKING BRIM with generic characters and still manages to have a cast of deeply intriguing characters. One Punch Man has a whole cast of characters I can't care about because they are super flat. The comedy is poorly timed...but I suspect there's a reason behind that.
When adapting OPM from print to screen, it suffered from a couple of pacing issues. I heard it takes SEVERAL chapters for the House of Evolution arc to even end, and that takes place in two episodes. So, when considering the pacing of when Saitama punches a villain in one hit and how it feels like it happens all the time, that would help explain it but not fully excuse it. This would also help explain the flat characters, but, again, not fully excuse it. But you have to remember that Madhouse was on a super tight budget on this, so 12 episodes was the most they could do. The pacing of OPM is both a blessing and a curse. Condensing that much content helps the pacing of the story move forward...but not the pacing of the comedy and the characters. This brings me to theming.
One Punch Man is at its weakest at its comedic moments...but surprisingly strong in its serious moments. Saitama's whole dilemma is that of a person who longs for a challenge. When a fighter eventually becomes the champion and easily defeats everyone...it's like a living hell. Having some NOT who they can't damage but RATHER who can damage THEM excites them, brings life back into them. The first episode of the show proves this, as Saitama dreams not of facing an opponent he cannot destroy, but of an opponent who can prove that he is still human. That he can still be hurt.
Another theme heavily used in OPM is what it means to be a hero. For this, I will compare Saitama and Mumen Rider.
Saitama is the strongest man in the world. He can defeat everyone and often saves several lives doing so. But he is seen as a villain in the eyes of the public, ridiculed and ignored for what he does, yet he doesn't care, because he doesn't and has never wanted appreciation. He's doing this because he wants to.
Mumen Rider is possibly the weakest character in the show. He never defeats anyone, yet he stood before the Deep Sea King unfazed. He gets the glory for the defeat of the Deep Sea King...but only after Saitama sacrifices his image for him.
Both heroes embody the ideal hero...and they are in a world where popularity and power are how we determine the greatness of a hero in our society.
But...the timing of the show kills this.
Right when a huge emotional moment happens, the show decides to make a fucking joke, removing any ounce of respect you had going for it. A huge emotional moment may happen at a climax...and then a joke is made...poorly timed to boot. This show has no idea what it wants to do, and it just keeps screwing itself over.
Now, we must discuss the origins of One Punch Man. One Punch Man was developed by ONE, an individual who wrote the original web novel. FOR FUN.
One Punch Man was literally written because someone was bored. 
However, after adapting it to manga format, the artist behind Eyeshield 21 redrew the entire series, and from around the point of the Boros fight, ONE decided to actually take the series seriously.
If OPM seems dumb to you, it's probably because it is. But, that does not mean there can be some meaning to it. Neon Genesis Evangelion was a show made by a down-on-his-luck Director who was struggling in his life that contained theming essentially included because it looked cool. It is now seen as some sort of symbolic icon in the anime industry and remains a landmark in Japanese animation. Because in art, you are meant to find your own meaning to it, and not everyone will get the same experience from it because art is THE most subjective construct on this planet. ONE may have written it for fun, but there was definitely some sort of meaning put in there, whether consciously or unconsciously, because every artist will put some aspect of themselves into the work they create. Am I implying that One Punch Man is this deep and symbolic piece of art? In some respects, yes. In some respects, no. I am simply implying that I can't exactly put it down for what it does well. Just saying. 
OVERALL
This show is certainly neither amazing nor bad. One Punch Man is a very entertaining show. In fact, this is one of the only shows I would watch every week as it aired because of just how easy and instantly gratifying it was to watch every episode. Sure, you leave every episode with a feeling of pointlessness, but you're never bored. It's like eating a Twinkie. They're delicious as you eat it, but you always feel like you're wasting your calories and have this disgusting fatty taste in your mouth. And millions of strange people shit on you for not loving it or hating it and castrate you for doing so-wait...
This show is deserving of all of its praise and all of its criticisms, and would make a perfect gateway anime for new viewers.
So, I have decided to award One Punch Man with a Medium Priority rating. Watch it if you feel like it, but it's certainly not a high priority.",7,WattheWut

                One punch man,my second favorite anime. 
Story-10-The story in one punch man is basically about this moron in his 20s wanting to become a hero... AS A HOBBY. He mentions this a lot to people mainly attempting to say that 'I don't care what you think. I'm a hero for a HOBBY!'This is really amusing because the towns people are just standing there thinking to themselves 'what got into this guy?' Also, one punch man has a lot of monsters in it and Saitama [the main character] gets really excited when one comes around which gets pretty exciting.
Art-10-I really like the art in one punch
                  man because the main character usually has this really stupid expression on his face which makes you want to burst out laughing.
Sound-10-Because it blends in perfectly with the anime.
Characters-10- Because the main character is so hilarious and has a great back story.
Enjoyment-10-This is mainly to do with the fact that Saitama is weird by choice.
Overall I'd rate this anime a 10",10,Al001

                First of all that I would like to say is that this anime is excellent, I haven't enjoyed an anime like this in a long time
The story is hilarious and the character designs are very good, they chose the perfect look and personality for the main protagonist, I'm not going to give anything away but this anime is a must watch and I just hope that they will be bringing out a season 2.
Its also a bit over the top and a bit ridiculous at times how he kills the enemy but that is what makes it good and the fighting scenes are very well
                  put together, there's a lot of action involved to keep you entertained.
I would recommend this anime for anybody who enjoys lots humor with a lot of action and it has a very good story line as well.",9,Maddogs

                One Punch Man is masterpiece, this anime truly sets the bar on it's great animation, great characters, and a badass ost. There are two reasons I love One Punch Man, First: it takes the concept of someone being able to beat enemies in one punch and gives me entertaining battles and a funny protagonist. Sure the the concept seems like, how can you make a story revolving around the concept, well...just check it out to see it. Second:The characters are the funniest badasses i've seen in recent years, as the voice actors fully give the characters life(Especially the villains). My overall enjoyment comes from the
                  actions and the characters being so fluid when they are seen on screen. One punch man started off as a webcomic, then adapted into a Manga (which is how I found out about it), then there's the anime...which I feel is a great anime. I just wish it was longer...",10,Imagineflame

                Ok. Started out really interesting and funny. I wasn't focusing on the combat scenes much because it was pretty predictable after a couple of scenes and i thought that wasn't the point of this anime. But then, more boring and cheesy fighting scenes. Kinda killed the characters for me. 
The characters were pretty cool and loved the dynamics between them. It's just everything went downhill after the 7th or 8th episode. The story could have been more interesting. I mean since episode 8 I've been watching an episode every month or something. The last episode was so slow and it felt like i was watching
                  it for so long, I had to browse the internet while watching. I'm glad i finished it. Definitely not watching season 2 unless with a couple of friends to joke on it.",5,Myuuzaki

                The OPM anime is simple, more simple than 2+2=4. It revolves around your non-aesthetically pleasing character known as Saitama. He’s an average guy who wants to be a hero for fun, and he wants to be acknowledged on all his good deeds. Sounds like your generic anime “hero” trope, but believe when I say that ONE (creator) keeps this anime edgy and fun through use of satirical context and parodist elements. OPM takes from other big name anime and fuses them together for comedic relief and nostalgic familiarity. Let’s begin on this review now that you have an idea of what OPM is like and
                  how it should be perceived…
Story:
In a world where monsters and aliens are commonplace and have the same goal, to conquer earth, one man steps ups, now he may be a hero for fun, but he packs quite the punch (pun intended). Saitama is the main character in the series and he has quite the special ability, he destroys everything/everyone with a single punch, hence the name. That’s really all there is to it. I’m not kidding. Saitama wins every match with a single blow and that makes him perceive life in an apathetic view. With no one strong enough to face and match his abilities, he joins the hero Association and gains a disciple by the name, Genos. So, in order to bring forth light into his life, Genos convinces him to join the Hero’s Association (Heroes contracted by the cities to serve and protect) and try to create a name for himself. As the story progresses Saitama builds a strong name and reputation for himself, but unfortunately, only the viewer (you) and Genos sees him doing all this. The people he is protecting are oblivious and stubborn. They do not accept Saiatama and thanks to other Heroes and their jealousy, Saitama is given a bad name and viewed as a freeloader, in terms of ranking up in the Hero Association. Talk about bad luck. This anime’s story is obviously made to be enjoyed and not touch on the depth of integral dialogue and plot. So, those of you that are new to this genre, please do not expect seriousness to  a full extent of other big name anime.
(7/10)
Art:
The artwork is truly phenomenal. Madhouse has revamped anime as a whole. The flow and beauty of artistic particles and movement will leave you breathless and hungry for more. It gives the anime justice. Regardless of knowing what will happen next with Saitama and his battles (which become predictable as it goes on), it’s how it will happen which will significantly absorb you. It’s fast-paced, uncensored, fluidity that will dilate your eyes and send you through a euphoric trip of pure ecstasy. 
(10/10)
Sound:
The battle themes were on point and corresponded well with the fluxing battle scenes and emotional tantrums of the various characters. They each had their own background song to match every facial and body expression. The opening song, THE HERO!! – Jam Project, is perfect and you’ll catch yourself by episode 2-3 singing alongside it, from start to finish. True forms of majestic sounds were definitely put into the series and nothing less, even at 12 episodes. 
(10/10)
Character(s):
In regards to the character development of Saitama (MC), there really isn’t much to see. He’s literally the endgame for every MC in the anime-scratch that, manga/anime/comic universe. Instead, there seems to be a reverse in his development. He’s already where he wants to be, but he must prove to the world the might he holds within his fists. It’s enjoyable to watch him struggle to win over his audience. 
Genos is another main character in the series and he’s quite the catch. There seems to be a loving relationship between the two. Instant chemistry, you’d think they have been friends for a lifetime. I feel they make the perfect duo and the development between the two is fascinating and enjoyable to watch, except for the fan fiction-fan service making its rounds on the internet, that’s a little strange, but to each their own. If anything that adds to the strong foundation created by the two. Genos, however, is trapped with the shadow of his past, but it’s thanks to Saitama’s lenient attitude and strong persona that Genos’ development is extremely expedited, in a perfect world.
Other heroes make their appearance as well, but the development isn’t as great, but at the
moment most of them are side characters. It isn’t until the end where they are actually exploited in terms of power, personality, and role in the series; definitely a special and different unique of character in this, but very enjoyable with perfect, un-forced chemistry with one another.
WE DON’T SEE FUBUKI, BLIZZARD OF HELL!!! :[
ENJOYMENT:
This anime is one for the books. It was so enjoyable it has gotten to the point where I am literally pre-ordering the English manga sets, and potential Blu-ray release of the anime. It’s a definite GOAT for me; on the top 5 of my list. It had me laughing, crying, yelling, and pretending all at once while watching. It’s been a while since I have seen an anime so great that I am out here praising it, unbiased of course.
This is what real time action-comedy-sienen anime should be like. Take notes future releases!
(10/10)
Overall:
In the end, reviews are professionally done opinions of something. I won’t ask you to take my review seriously or my words to heart, but what I do want you to do with this is, consider the anime. Believe me, I wouldn’t be here writing this as neat and coherent for anything or anyone, unless I 100% believe it is worth anyone’s time. I hope you found this review helpful, and I hope it cleared out any haze of doubt you may have for the series. Don’t listen to the masses, as I always say, just because an entire group of people hates it, don’t mean you will to. Remember, everyone has different preferences! Give it out go! Thank you…

                After not watching this show in over a year, I saw adult swim was doing an English Dub of the show. I couldn't resist but watch it again (though the dubs only 6 episodes in), it was just as much of a pleasure to watch as the first time I watched it. I highly recommend it to anyone, it's mix of creative character design and amazing visuals made me fall in live with the show yet again! From the first episode I knew it was going to be an action show, however this show completely redefined the genre, it was badass! It's a great watch

                There is no plot. This has a writing as poor as DBZ while not being as enjoyable.
Yes here comes a bad meany guy, everyone else but Goku gets rekt, Goku gets rekt, screams a lot and wins.
On OPM is exactly the same but without Saitama screaming or getting rekt.
The story is literally an evil meany guy comes, Saitama finds him and obliterates him. The end.
The final ""battle"" is exactly the same.
The show only shines when other characters are fighting or when we see anything that isnt Saitama 1-shooting anything on sight.
The plot and the story in itself is beyond insulting as there are a lot
                  of questions that can only be answered with : Because the writter said so.
A lot of characters (specially the villains) are carbon copies of other characters that have been on other animes since the beggining of time.
Also i know it might be on purpose but Saitama seems so alien 80% of the time (talking about art). He looks like he doesnt belong to the show. Imagine that Goku from DBZ was into i dunno Nekopara, Kemono Friends or The Simpsons.
 I guess omnipotence means losing your eyeballs unless the camera zooms in on your eyes?
Also Saitama VA doesnt fit him at all! I was expecting a voice incredibly calm and soft but he speaks like english dub Goku...  I know he is allmighty but the show tries to portray him as a non threatening guy until he punches stuff (and then he gains eyeballs and is drawn into a proper way).
I can understand that one can be amused a little by ""Haha that guy seemed so big and imposing and he got rekt"" in a David vs Goliat way but that joke gets boring really fast. 
Mostly because its not a joke. We all know whatever Saitama is hitting is gonna get destroyed so where is the surprise after seeing him do it for the 5º time?
I don't know how this anime could be considered ""comedy"" honestly. I barely had any fun.
The art (ignoring Saitama) is the only thing i could praise about the show but is something to be expected from a studio like Madhouse.",4,CordobezEverdeen

                Grew tired of kids being weak and in a few episodes being able to fight the badasst guys? 
Than let me introduce you to this beautiful masterpiece called "" OnePunchMan"".
 Some say it is predictable. Well it is in a way BUT. Have you seen an anime where the main hero is so strong his\her enemies have to get stronger to try to defeat the hero. I mean if you are just tired of seeing you beloved Naruto, Ichigo, Natsu being destroyed to shi*t and in a blink of an eye gain so much power that they defeat all of their foes than this anime
                  is for you. The main hero is so cool he does not need to look cool. Now how cool is that.
 Anyway. Just watch it you will love it. The music, the art, the characters. Everything is great.

                One punch man, where do I start? This action comedy series has been hyped up by a large number of people, who say it has ""saved anime"". How many times has anime been saved again? Anime never really needed a savior in my opinion, but I digress.
Story
7/10
The story is nothing philosophical, but it does it's job. It gives you enough material to work with for 12 episodes, but not much more it seems to me. The whole ""everything dies in one punch"" gimmick can't stay funny forever, and near the end it felt anticlimactic. Although, I suppose that was the intended purpose.
Art
8/10
The fight scenes feel
                  smooth and well drawn, and the normal exposition/joke scenes are pretty decent as well. Except when the characters are drawn in the original webcomic style on purpose, which make up some of the funniest moments in the show.
Sound
7/10
The only reason I give it a 7/10 is because the opening is one of the hypest openings I've ever seen/heard. I could listen to that all day. But the rest of the soundtrack is... forgettable. I can't recall a single song except the opening.
Characters
8/10
The characters were what made me watch more. Not because of serious development (although we see a little bit of that on Saitama's part) but because of the unbelievably hilarious dialog everyone had. Seriously, this show is really funny sometimes.

                One Punch Man is adapted from the manga by Yusuke Murata , which it self is adapt by the web-comic series by ONE (no one knows his name). 
When I had first heard about this anime and about how great it was and the hype was for it, I didn't want to watch it.
I had been lured into the trap before, where something such as a show or game got more hype then it was actually worth and just left me feeling disappointed for having unrealistic expectations. And when you have those expectations, it just wrecks a show/game that you could have some what enjoyed,
                  even if it wasn't a grand masterpiece.
But then, I watched a little snip-it of one of the episodes, and how good the fighting animation was and I thought, why not? It was also done by MAD HOUSE, which I love there other work as well so I thought one episode couldn't hurt.
Boy, I was wrong.
When I started watching it, the four episode had just come out, and I watched all of it in one sitting. It was then that I become the hype. I was literally dying every week just waiting for a new episode to come, discussing what had happen or could happen and just basically jumping the band-wagon.
And I also learned one thing that I hate more than crushing disappointments, is waiting for a new episode.
If your like me, you like to watch everything in one sitting or watch as mush as you can in what little time you have (and yes I do some what have a life other than anime).
But of course, this isn't the shows fault at all. Just fans showing how much they appreciate a show and not caring about any else's opinions or criticisms. But anyway on to the actually review.
Now the one thing you have to remember about One Punch Man, is that it's all a joke. Literally, ONE had made the comic purely for shits and giggles not expecting any one to actually like it or have a massive following. I mean it's just chock-a-block full of jokes, stereotypes and references to make fun at the superhero genre. Saitama's whole thing is ""being a hero for fun"", which is just another joke, showing him as a average looking no-body with a somewhat bland personality. But in the end you learn to like his blandness because its somewhat refreshing in a world where being a superhero you have to be the best at everything, it's all a competition. And there's Saitama, worrying that he's going to miss the shopping sales.
So I can understand people not liking it or not seeing the whole hype for it. It doesn't have much story depth, or much character development that you would normally see in an anime of today. You can also pretty much guess where it's going, it's not real hard to follow and it's pretty straight forward in it's plot, well whatever little plot it has.
But it does have some parts that make you stop and think about the whole ""superhero"" image and what it really means at the end of the day. The anime is also spit into sagas, but they all somewhat go in chronicle order.
There is one thing that One Punch Man has going for it is the animation. It's smooth and flows effortless, with fight scenes almost gliding on the screen. Your eyes are literally glued, watching every move that the characters make.  The animation was pretty constant over the episodes,  and the environments were drawn good as well. 
The characters themselves were all somewhat unique in there on way, with colours and clothes matching their personality and powers. Even Saitama's simplistic costume, showed his averageness and bland outlook on life. But the animation made up for it in showing just how powerful Saitama really is.
But overall, as said above the animation stood out when the fights rolled in, showing them to be big and explosive, which is just what you want.
The soundtrack is also gold in it's self, with guitar riffs galore and some characters like Saitama, Genos and even Mumen Rider having their own theme. The music fitted the fights well, pumping you up and adding atmosphere to the scenes, just wanting for the next punch. The voices for the characters fitted them all pretty well, with even Tornado of Terror (Aoi Yuuki, there is no dub as of this review) high-pitched voice fitted her childlike personality brilliantly.
Now if you were to ask me, what got me to love this anime? the opening. To me, I think an opening should be eye catching, it should show what you are to expect and set the mood. ""The Hero!! Set Fire to the Furious Fist"" by JAM Project, did just that. By the end of the song , had already downloaded it on to my phone. The ending song was pretty good, not what you would expect in a comedy/action anime  and the lyrics didn't really seem to fit, but it wrap things up nicely.
The characters as whole were good. They all had their own personality with flaws and strengths, well some more strength then others. There were many characters that only got a few scene time, just for you to get a taste and then move on to the next scene. Because this is an action based show, this is bound to happen, so that monument can be kept.
I generally liked all the characters, even the villains but specially Saitama and Genos who are the main ones, I loved the most. Not to spoil to much, but the contrast between Saitama and Genos is very interesting. One is your typically I-have-a-tragic-past-which-makes-me-stronger theme which is very over used in the superhero gene, but somewhat plays well here when paired with one that a superhero ""for fun"", and sits around all day watching T.V and reading manga, living your typical N.E.E.T life. 
Overall I enjoyed it immensely, if you couldn't already tell from above. As I'm sure you know it's been a huge success, with a cult-following. It combines action-packed fights with jokes and a character that seems so boring, but surprises you with his amazing strength and stubbornness. 
This is a show I would definitely recommend to people who are new to anime and want to start with something not too complicated but fun or to anyone in general.",9,Khesi

                One Punch Man is a hilarious and enjoyable anime. I'll be honest; I haven't had much exposure to this genre of anime (mainly action) but even a novice would be able to pick out the many hilarious puns that are sprinkled here and there.  But more precisely, it is the synergy between action, comedy and slice of life that really make One Punch Man (OPM) shine.
I mean, who doesn't like an anime where the main character actually follows the name of the anime? Really the protagonist is front and center with all the other things ending up revolving around him. His hilarious sidekick, other
                  supporting characters, and the main governmental organisation in charge of most of the characters in the anime are really, in the end, foil for his one liners, his antics, his pearls of wisdom before he drops that punch.
On a technical note, there is nothing really cringeworthy to see or hear; everything feels about right, with the fight scenes rendered well and standard typical anime responses to hilarious dialogue. Whilst not particularly innovative, that isn't really the point; the point is to find it fun where evil is defeated with a single punch, and it really makes it so!
Yet I cannot help but feel that the entire premise, whist being so funny and interesting and engaging, is really just a one shot thing. There is nothing really engaging about it, nothing really visceral, nothing that tugs you at the strings of your heart, nothing that really makes you question anything important or relevant.
And whilst it doesn't really affect the anime in itself, for an anime that feels set up for another season, OPM has yet to really ask the question: will there really be something challenging? Or will it just continue with the entire premise of OPM. It has yet to be answered and a failure to really hint at what path it would take is, to me, a disappointment.
The producers are to be commended for creating an anime that is interesting, fresh and generally innovative for the genre. But in the end, OPM made me sit down for a few hours, enjoy some comedy, then stand up again. But better works make you sit down and never stand back up again.

                The story of one punch man doesn't have to be great but simple is i rated it about 7 but everything else excels with a 10.
This is the kinda show, that is a slapstick of every super hero in marvel and DC but the main one they reference is superman outfit and the abnormal ability some spoilers.
Saitama is a normal human who wanted to bring justice and become a hero for fun and for other reason compared to other superheros. He is simple thinks of himself as a normal human being an example is his disciple ish Genos says can you fly he said he
                  just a normal human. This show does not have any limits because it senien not shouen so it doesn't have limitation for languages or art.
Lastly if you love OP funny az fuck  character with awesome production watch this because its simplicity is just amazing and also its fights scene even have better production than fate stay unlimited blade works if it comes to action, it has the best animation and fight scenes out every anime that existed no jokes if i am wrong tell me about it but anyways, people who love action,comedy, shouen ish , orginallity watch this please u won't regret it.",10,Baba_Zone1

                This anime was very commented when was on the air, personally i expected more of this universe presented in the story, want to see more of that cast of characters because we don´t see so much about the past of characters.
+There are some sopilers.
Story (7). Story was... Meh... It´s good but don´t center in any point, it doesn't go anywere. Nothing about the misterious saitama's powers. A little bit of the geno's past, but nothing of the other world , and the rest of the ""S-class superheroes"", we don't know nothing about them. In general it's all about the problems of the society to solve
                  de kaijus problem with the Hero's Association, and how saitama saves the day every once, making the efforts of the rest of super hero's useless. 
Art (8). The art it's very good, a lot of details. It's a shame many of the art don't be used better, for example in locations like the alien spaceship or the Hero's HQ, the scenes are so empty, generic desings, poorly detailed compared with the cities of another places in the anime. The fights are the strong point of the art: frenetic battles and charged of massive destruction, visual effects, and a great demostration of movements and powers, this fights rember me to Dragon Ball Z.
Sound (9). Heavy guitars, excellent intro, and the ending... meh...
Character (7). All the characters was great, good desings, variety of skins, i see black heros, white heros, red heads, blondes, etc. It´s very rich in that sense, but falied giving them life and personality, the story don't tell much about life and past of the cast, except for geno's and saitama. And the Saitama's story and past in general was poorly developed, and was so insipid.
Enjoyment (9). I laught with some scenes, the comedy it's another strong point of the anime, the funny scenes and the script in each chapter makes very enjoyable.
Overall (8). Was funny to see, but it leaves open questions, and many character might be have more protagonism, the story have no direction in general, and i don't expect much for the sequel. It's regular in the script and waste the characters.
*note: The scene of the Bike guy beated by the Lord of sea was patetic and innecesary, the bike guy it's consient that is useless against powerful kaijus, and he doesn't matter to fight, he's wasn't fight for make time, he wasn't fight for distract and let the people run away, he's was fight because ""he have to do it"" there are better ways for suicide, but well, probaly he wants to be a martyr. And the Hero association looks like a popularity contest: all the heroes wants to up in the rank, for the fame and respect.",8,MaeseWitcher

Now that the anime finished airing, all anime fans are divided into 2 kinds. The first one is those who think that this anime is the best/one of the best ever, at least from what they've watched, and others who think that OPM anime is overrated. I belong to the second kind. I'm not a hater. I've completed watching it, and i enjoyed it a lot. I'm not saying that overrated means bad or mediocre. I personally think that it was a good anime.
Story - 7 
OPM plot is very simple. Saitama is so strong that he can
                  defeat every villain with just one punch. The anime has a lot of action and awesome fights, but it lacks depth in the plot. It is just Saitama who meets other heroes, and they fight with the villains(or each other). The plot flaws decent. Of course, you can't have very deep plot for an anime with 12 episodes, but i've seen other anime with 12 or 10 episodes who had at least an interesting plot.
Art/Animation - 10
I don't have much to say  here. Yes, this was an incredible animation for an action anime. Detailed backrounds, awesome art on characters and unique special effects during the fights. Action scenes drawn fantastically and very fluid and diverse, what is to be expected of a Madhouse produced anime. 
Sound -  8
Nothing too good here, but that doesn't mean that it is bad. The voice acting and the backround music is very good and everything fits the atmosphere and the characters. Also, there is no narrator.
Characters - 8 
Varied characters, but very one-dimensional  and stereotypical. It fits with the narrative and overall story that it is trying to convey. You have some awesome heroes(from cyborgs to ninjas) but nothing too good/special about them. And you get to see the typical villains.
Enjoyment - 9 
Despite considering this anime overrated, i can't say that i didn't enjoy it. Awesome fights and full of action. That's why i (mostly) enjoyed it.
Overal - 8 
Hype destroys everything. Seriously. I got bored/tired by this huge hype. I understand why this anime was so hyped, but i can't understand why people think it's too good. For me, this DOES NOT deserve to be so high at the top anime list. The well executed action scenes alongside the top-notch animation quality, certainly makes it worth a watch on its own, yet is not suited for anyone who wants to see epic story/plot, characters with well rounded backstories etc...

                One Punch became real popular because it catered to casuals who aren't smart enough to experience well-writen thought-provoking anime. The type of people who lack the ability to understand anything that isn't nonstop action and fighting just the bottom of the barrel kinda, people.
Story(1): Boring nothing good at all, just some guy who goes around punching things and winning. Nothing else to the story so bland, so boring the story had zero depth, it definitely was not entertaining unless all you like to see is pointless fighting didn't introduce any cool themes or thought-provoking ideas. The comedy was far from funny it was just stupid
                  and cheezy anyone who laughed because of the faces he made are idiots. Villains are bad because they are bad. definitely far from a thriller, I knew this isn't a thriller but when you think thriller this is the complete opposite. You already know who is gonna win every fight what a surprise.
characters(1): What an awful main character as said above (not gonna waste time on explaining him just read the second paragraph ) the other characters only relied on the main character ZERO character development 
Enjoyment(2): far from it
Art(3): if you watch it on 520 p and compare it to 1080 p it looks the same that's how little effort was put into it. A 3 is a pitty point from me 
Overall(2): I watched this because people told me it was good and I thought that something was wrong with me for not liking it and in my heart, I thought it was appalling. If you thought this was GREAT and never watched it again its because it was never good.",2,Fierrza

                Hey Vegeta, what does the scouter say about his power level?
Story:
This anime takes the shounen approach and completely twists it around. Saitama is already the strongest person in the world and there is no becoming stronger or overcoming the odds, just one punch and the enemy is done for. So, how do you make this premise interesting for more than two episodes? Making it so that nobody believes he is really that strong and have him climb the ranks of the hero association little by little. This is as simple as it is clever and manages to make One Punch Man an enjoyable watch, as
                  it also features the other heroes and their fights (which are often more traditional shounen action).
10/10
Art:
What can I say? The action scenes look pretty cool, the character designs are incredibly creative and the whole world is very colorful, like in a classic superhero comic. On top of that, the face faults are some of the most funny I've ever seen.
9/10
Sound:
I like how Saitama always sounds enormously bored, while everybody else is getting pumped up screaming. I also think I found my favourite Aoi Yuuki performance (<3). The opening reminds me of over the top 80s metal acts, which fits nicely (also the song is great), the ending however is very cacophonic, which my ears didn't like at all.
8/10
Characters:
The huge number of colorful, creative and mostly over the top characters reminded me of One Piece, which I think is the manga/anime that is the best in creating characters. I think I can still recall every single hero and villain in the show, which is pretty impressive, since I usually even have problems with a shows main characters name. If it wasn't for all these hilarious guys (and girl), OPM would have only been half as enjoyable.
10/10
Enjoyment:
You probably already guessed that I enjoyed watching One Punch Man and that it is a definite recommandation, so let's take a look at the little things I didn't enjoy so much. The beginning is somewhat slow, as the one punch-thing gets old really fast, but the hero association is only introduced after a couple of episodes. I also would have liked Genos to have more depth (which may or may not happen in a later season). And the fact that Saitama is bound to win every fight prevents any tension from building, sadly. Aside from that, OPM is a great anime, no doubt.

                This review is based on all the episodes they have released so far (12) of One Punch Man.
The story felt a little rushed at first as they jumped straight into the action from the very first episode without really setting up the characters or world at all but this was really just to give you an appreciation of the beauty of this anime, as well as let you know exactly what you're in for. An action-packed adrenaline rush. Within a few episodes though they slowed down (a tiny bit) to involve some backstory and plot which has been entertaining and kept me watching episode to
                  episode excited about what's coming next.
The art style in this anime is second to none. It's brilliant and has a certain polish to it's look whether it's in the more comedic or full on action scenes. I can not fault this anime for it's aesthetics.
The audio in this show is fantastic from the sound effects, voice acting or music. I have really enjoyed it and it definitely adds to the overall quality of the show.
While this show is faultless in many areas probably my favourite part so far has been the characters. From the villains, to the heroes, to our main protagonist Saitama they are all completely badass and are an absolute treat to watch.
This is the best new anime I've watched in the last few years and I am truly loving it so far. I just wish season 2 was out already!!",10,Sooza

                *This review does not contain any spoilers and I will break it down seperately starting from my personal opinion and enjoyment, following by the specific categories I judge on each anime.*
I will try my best to make this an easy-to understand review for those who have watched or haven't. Enjoy,
Ahh, One Punch Man. The highly anticipated anime of 2015 has finally ended, and with that being said; I enjoyed it to the fullest. Now there are a couple of flaws in this anime which really bothers me so I suppose this is the right place to be when I need to inform others and place
                  my personal opinon. Don't get me wrong, this anime was great...it just needed some supporting factors that I believe, and anime should ALWAYS have.
""Personal opinon"":
I'll be honest right now, One Punch Man is an anime I struggled to pass by in the first couple episodes. We started off seeing repetitive humor and poor character development. Not to mention, we see a new enemy every single episode. Now this kind of indirectly states that this anime has no story, so you might not be at the right place when looking at this anime. The main two genres of this anime is Comedy and Action. This is where OPM is focused on. While the other genres are shounen, adventure etc....the anime does not do them any justice. The first couple episodes, it is just Saitama proving his strenth through countless encounters of wild enemies and monsters. This is where the boring part is in my opinon. He kills everyone in one punch and the story goes along with humor; which some may find humorous while others find them not funny(myself).
The anime continues along with that direction up until episode 6 or so, where they introduce the Hero Association. This is where saitama finds a reason to fight other than to fight for fun, and to find an enemy he can't defeat in one punch. Enough my of little speculations, I will start to go in depth of this review.
|Story|:7
The story for OPM is alright. And by alright, I mean average. we see our MC killing monsters in cool battles but the real action picks up near the end of this 12- episode anime. Which kind of sucks to me. The hero association is a great add-on to this anime because we see new characters, and get to witness new powers , who wouldnt love that. All in all, this anime doesn't really have a story, rather it is a bundle of episodes with action and epicness.
|Animation|:10
Now I'm going to go ahead and say the animation was priceless. Each and every particle for the fight scenes were taken care of by the amazing animator. Ranging from explosives,powers,landscapes and faces we see a lot of detail in them and a lot of effort given into them which is a really good thing in my opinion. I like how Saitama kind of had two faces, and how they made a bunch of expressions, and this time; some of them were funny.
|Sound|:9
Not much to say here, it was well done in my opinion. The opening was amazing, and really catchy. Has to be one of my favourite indeed. And when this Opening was played in the final fight, we get a goosebump reaction which we all love as anime fans. So they did great in that aspect. Ost's were well put together and they were all time oriented.
|Character|:6
Yay, the worst part of this anime....Poor character development is what I mean. If youre not a fan of new characters every episode and no background information on them, then youre not at the right place. I personally hate that, and because of that I can't seem to find a specific story in this anime. Theres no origination, or a specifically stated desire or achievement in Saitama. Orher than the one stated in the anime description, there is no character emotions or such. We all focused on the epicness that the fights gave us.
|Enjoyment|:9
I don't want anyone thinking I'm Saitama hater...he's definitely amusing to see fight and is strong, which is what we all like. The character and story as
ects of this anime isn't just what I hoped for it to be. But it mainly being focused on Action and Comedy, I believe it did a great job in fulfilling those categories and truly doing them justice.
|Overall| 
This was a great anime, and was fun to watch, it did some parts wrong but in the end, once you watch it all you will see the real reason for this anime and why there was so much hype built up in the upcoming-2015 anime.
But for the reasons I have stated above, unfortunately this anime does not deserve a 10/10.
Keep in mind, you will see many reviews splurging out 10 on 10's but they are the people who don't look at anime in depth. They just look at one genre(action in this case) and see if it is good. We all enjoyed it, but some people need to think back and tell themsleves..is this really an anime I will never forget? Time will only tell.",9,Papermate

                One Punch Man, if you thought Dragon Ball and One Piece were too intellectual this is the show for you.
Story: 2
The story or lack thereof is about Saitama, a very average looking bald man that for some reason (which is never explained) can defeat the most powerful enemies with just one punch. Throughout the 12 episodes the show will present the viewer countless nonsensical situations, where Saitama needs to defeat very powerful beings obsessed with destroying things. But since the hero can kill anything with just one punch, it completely negates any sense of tension or struggle.
While the premise of this anime could lead one
                  to believe that this would be a parody of the super power shonen genre, 95% of all comedy bits fall completely flat. Just because a joke can be amusing once that doesn't mean it will be funny for the next 11 episodes.
Art: 6
By far the best part, the art in this show is actually pretty decent, especially the fighting scenes.
The drawings have a significant amount of detail and the animation is fluid.
But that's where the art ""pro's"" end.
During fight scenes there's a lot of shaky cam and most of them involve a gigantic amount of destruction right from the first episodes. This means the anime quickly becomes visually repetitive and annoying. And when it comes to the comedy bits it don't fare much better.
When the show tries to be funny (and fails) the art goes from the very simplistic to the very detailed. But because the jokes don't work most of the time, it ends up looking lazy and pointless.
A more visual consistent representation would work much better.
Sound: 5
I can't remember a single track from the score so i have to say it's forgettable, but since i also  didn't find it to be annoying enough to remember that can only be a good thing.
When it comes to the voice over i have nothing negative to say and i think most actors did a good job.
Characters: 5
In a story where the main hero is invincible what role does the other heroes play?
None, they are completely irrelevant.
While i found some characters compelling (much more than Saitama) they serve no purpose other than to fill the enormous void that is the pathetic story. They have strengths and weaknesses and character flaws, but all that is pointless when their struggles are met with a invincible hero that can't die.
It really is too bad, since i they would be interesting characters in any other shonen story.
Enjoyment: 1
I'm glad to say that this show is slightly more amusing than watching grass grow, or maybe not i can't tell anymore.
Overall/ Conclusion: 4
One Punch Man has to be one of the most fascinating social experiments in anime form i have ever seen. It truly is the living proof, that you can turn a unbelievable mediocre show into a success, as long as you cater to the lowest common denominator.
But despite how incredibly dumb and lackluster it is, i can still recommend this show for the lovers of the brainless super power shonen genre. 
Just keep in mind that if all you want is senseless explosions and destruction there are much better alternatives out there.",4,Ayato-kun

                Anime Review No.17
Just recently finish “One Punch Man” Today and re-watched the episodes 2 times just to confirm what I actually think about the show.
Brief Scoring: 
Plot: (7/10) Good for being a satire of super heroes parody
Characters: (7/10) Good for having distinguishable and cool charactersMusic:(10/10) I like the OP and ED and also the BGM (This is kinda subjective)
Animation: (10/10) High Production Values
Overall: (7.9/10) A good heavy action-comedy anime (Worth recommending to others)
Overview
Plot (7/10)
The story is down to basic. Evil Monster or villains will appear in every episode then Saitama will arrive and end it with “One Punch” and that’s it. This is the primary of formula of the story. You can already know what the story is all about by just reading the title in solid English “ONE PUNCH MAN”.
 The joke of beating anyone with one punch on every episode can be very boring and less thrilling because you already know that saitama will win no matter what and how strong his enemy is. But let us not forget that this anime is a “Parody”. 
Almost everything in it is a joke that you don’t even bother take it seriously that’s where I like about the anime. It’s not trying to be something different or pretending to be something. It’s superficial setting with silly looking villains and silly looking heroes with silly world building. 
My Statement why the Plot is already a parody to begin wit:
A world where the police force and military doesn’t exist for protecting people and only people with fancy or funny looking consumes are there to save the day. I don’t even see Cops patrolling around. Oh wait if cops exist then there will be no “Class C” hero to exist.
 A world where countries doesn’t exist and it replace by cities from A-Z like the person who named the areas is a 4 year old wanting to memories the Alphabets..
 A world where monsters, super villains, aliens and mystical being exist but humanity is still not on the verge of extinction  even if a lot of city just got constantly attack and destroyed instantly. But people can still continue their normal lives because there houses can be built easily within a few days .
 Wait if cities got destroyed so fast why is there isn’t any casualties?  It’s a that  show didn’t care because we are watching it for the action and comedy and not the drama duH.
 I am amaze on how abandon cities like city Z have a working electricity and water system are working properly. Some people live there because of the “cheap rent”. Saitama don’t mind because no monster spouting like mushroom can’t kill or beat him. It’s just your normal super hero life.
Lastly the story just focus on the action more while making a joke on every serious aspect it has. Well that’s parody being sane about it will just waste your brain cells.
Characters (7/10) 
First of all I like all the characters of the show because they are presented to be cool and awesome. The super villains have a fair share of awesomeness too but someone just have to throw everything in the window to prove everything is a joke to begin with and that guy name is “Saitama” and nobody knows his complete name. Saitama is already OP in his universe because nobody can’t even levels him in actual combat. But he can be beaten by a simple contest of eating the spiciest ramen and beaten by a ""cyborg” while at it made it another joke. 
It’s pretty boring seeing a “God-Mode” character walking around trolling everybody. Same feeling when I am playing video games while “God-Mode” cheat is on.
There isn’t much character depth in the show but seeing mumen rider determination around sea king arc and pretty prisoner status. I am convince there are some motivation to drive the characters around. It lessen for me see the characters as spectacle or a plot device in the show. Each character represents a parody on their corresponding reference with some deep message lurking around.  Character development is present in the show. Genos learned from his mistakes and able to improve it even he also got his ass kick all the time. I won’t to mention everybody since there character development is too small to even considered a major change. 
As for character fleshing out, the show did a very good job explaining a preview about the heroes and the bad guys. I like the side characters more than saitama but I dislike Tatsumaki and her tsundere character because among the entire cast she is the common archetype and the most annoying. I see her as a waifu bait than an actual character to care about.
Music & Animation (10/10)
(Subjective)
The opening music “Hero” is just awesome and it’s work good to be Background music too. You will know you’re watching an action heavy show by just listening from it. BGM is good for the action and change of atmosphere. They know how to shift serious tone to comedic tone and same goes to the animation. The ED Hoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru is a good ending song well it did make me relax after every ending episode.
The animation for one punch man is superb.The action scenes are well animated. Good action is what I am aiming for one punch anyways and they didn’t hold back on the fight scenes. It’s a superhero theme show there are bound to have heavy action. It already surpasses the action flick of the remastered manga version so yeah.
Enjoyment (9/10)
I got a lot of fun watching One Punch Man seriously. I like the battles, I like the goofy characters, I love the super ignorant super villains and anti-hero characters. I like the dumb comedy of the show and that is all. One Punch Man is good time passer. It’s not a very entertaining story but it did a good job on presenting on what the show is all about. The best “Action-Comedy” I watched this year 2015.
Overall (7.9/10)
This anime is not for everybody. People looking for complicated and super serious super hero stories won’t like the show much but if One Punch Man to be rated generally it’s good enough to be average or above average and next to decent show. I see One Punch a breath of fresh air. for over the years I am watching anime with super power theme, I am just getting overpowered beta males that wins fame and glory while gathering a harem. One Punch doesn’t have that kind of formula. Saitama is super strong super that nobody has the right brain cells to even see it. Saitama got tons of hater and even called a cheat. Some anime do use the OP character getting hate formula but that is in a serious tone while OPM just make it a harmless joke. 
My main point here that people are taking OPM seriously even if the show itself is already giving indirect hints that show is superficial and a complete parody. I accepted what the show is all about and for that I enjoy the show because I know from the very start on what the anime is planning to be and that is “One Punch Man”.
This is my opinion not yours. Everybody have different reference.",8,Ezekiel_01

                This anime is a set of virtually unrelated episodes, the plot of which is a primitive template sketch about a supervillain who will definitely fly off at the end of the chapter (and this is not “Supernatural” from the anime world).
Such a description does not necessarily mean something bad. It just needs to be taken for granted because the first few episodes were really interesting, funny and very beautiful. They were filled with pleasant satire, a curious story, and wonderful action. Yes, in the beginning, when viewer does not know yet that in the second half of the season he'll get a looped senseless and
                  uninteresting meat grinder with some kind of random characters who suddenly shifted our protagonist and occupied 90% of screen time.
Seriously, at one point, by the middle of the season, there will not be a crumb of meaning, logic, or at least interesting moments in the show. Happening events would be not interesting and funny, but boring and ... Shameful! Moreover, it is embarrassing not at all because of the sharp deterioration in the quality of humour (although they have really deteriorated sharply), but due to the fact that the brilliant idea and the beginnings of the title are drained so tasteless and ineptly. What happens is decidedly unclear. The most obvious explanation is that the script ended on the fifth episode, and it was decided to improvise, as one eminent director had bequeathed.
In general, after watching remains a negative impression, although this is not the worst anime that you could see. At least it is very short. By the way, I don’t see the slightest sense to watch the second season after that kind of the first one.",4,FOTCH

                This is a review of One Punch Man.  There.  That's all the introduction you need.  (That right there is less than twenty words.  The review on the other hand won't be the same.)  
One Punch Man is a show that's very simple in concept.  We follow our main protagonist Saitama, a man who is a 'hero for fun', a man who can defeat everything, in just one punch.  And for our story basis, that's all we have to go off on.  
As a concept, OPM (I will call One Punch Man it's acronym OPM for this review
                  for ease) is vastly different take on the idea of a hero.  Historically, heroes are known as people who are well known for their courage and their achievements that help benefit society as a whole.  In pop culture, the idea of a hero takes the form of superheroes, beings who fight for justice and generally protect one city and fight the bad guys that would otherwise threaten society.  OPM satirizes that idea with Saitama and his ability to get rid of things with one punch.  He is a half-assed hero with an even more half-assed story, as he's not someone who endured great hardship or had to have life changing events in order to become the person he is, but rather just someone who decided to be a hero just because he thought it was fun.  This satirization is what takes up the majority of the screentime, which is Saitama going around and beating up bad guys with ease simply because he as a character is just too overpowered as a being.  They continue this idea by making these ridiculous villains with huge backstories, saying that it's just 'too long' since so many villains just go on and on and on (twenty words or less, goddamnit!) and making the world a bunch of lettered cities like City A, City B, which reflects the individual cities that a general superhero watches over.  
On the flipside of this, we have this more serious aspect of the hero, deconstructing what it means to be a person of justice and the expectations people have from you.  Personally, I found this part of the show to be the aspect that really made the show shine, because it not only showed us the impact that Saitama as a character has to the world because he's so OP, but it also really shows what it means to be a hero through Genos and Mumen Rider, and the sacrifices that one has to make since heroes can only save and/or do so much in any given problem.  
And so, as a result of OPM tackling both satirical concepts and a deconstruction aspect of the idea of a hero, we in the end get a polarizing combination of the two that in the end, just doesn't work for the series.  For one thing, the part of Saitama being the overpowered One Punch Man that he is both a blessing and a curse.  The comedic aspect of Saitama beating everything in one hit takes up the majority of the show and only gives a little bit of the entire screentime to the more serious and deconstruction aspect of the series.  Not only that, but Saitama is a mcguffin for the series, a plot device that helps the show, but also has a severe and heavily unsolvable impact.  Because he exists in the series, a lot of the struggle that the show has in any situation with any of the other heroes doesn't really put me on the edge of my seat simply because Saitama exists.  We know he's going to arrive on the scene because he is the main protagonist (why wouldn't he?) and as such, doesn't really make me feel concerned about whether the good guys are gonna win because Saitama is there to fix up the problems that the show presented.  Now, after and event like that, we do get the more serious side of the show, but it really just feels like more of an effect rather than a core part that would make the show better thematically as a whole; it feels like more of an afterthought.  
Characters for OPM also reflect the two aspects of the show.  Genos and Mumen Rider specifically show us what it means to be a hero, the deconstruction aspect, showing us that a true hero fights for good and does their best to help people in the best way possible.  Genos specifically grows as a character because being he learns that being a hero doesn't mean defeating evil, but helping the innocent and saving the ones who didn't do anything wrong from the looming threat at hand.  It's because of this growth that I find the serious aspect more interesting and better quality than its other more comedic half (or 3/4 in this case), that I'm sad to see it really only be a continuing subplot rather than the main story.  
Other characters like Tornado, Atomic Samurai, and various other heroes while don't come into the story until much later still add to the story by being a good meld of the dual parts of the show, being the sort of ridiculous superheroes that we grow to love, but also as representations of other heroes that exist.  The fact that not everyone fights for good, and some really do it just to show off how great they are as a person; selfish reasons.  As such, while they have less appearance in the show, still make a large impact that helps the show in a big way.
And so you may be asking, why is Saitama, the title character of the series talked last?  Well, it's because Saitama isn't so much of a character, as he is an idea.  Hear me out here.  As a character, Saitama is very simple.  He wants to find a worthy opponent against his scarily immense strength, and spends the entire series doing that.  Any criticism towards how he does things in the show really doesn't bother him and adds in to that aspect of deconstruction that I've been mentioning.  While at the same time, he as the One Punch Man satirizes the idea of the hero by beating the shit out of everything in one hit, challenging the general struggle that superheroes face.  As a result, we have this polarizing character that adds to both aspects of the show, but doesn't change as a character.  Saitama is literally the same person from start to finish without really much change.  He wants to find that opponent that would give him a challenging fight and it's just very hollow to see that concept over and over again in the series without any change, thus making him feel like more of a plot device than an actual character.
As expected of Madhouse, the animation for Saitama's Punching Show is nothing less than top notch.  OPM has a distinct style that can be both comedic and serious without changing the innate style.  As such, every bit of the show from start to end really ties in together, from Saitama's stoic and unimpressed face to the bulging muscles on every villain and/or character that looks like they've been taking massive, massive steroids.  There's nothing else to say about it aside from just how fluid and well done the animation is done, and for that, I applaud Madhouse.  
The Soundtrack for OPM is something of an oddity from what I see.  First of all, we have its Opening, ""THE HERO!!!"" (yes, that's the actual title.  And it is far too fitting.)  I have no complaints about this OP.  It fully encompasses what we should and can expect from this show, which is epic punching and fight scenes that are very well done in quality.  It's a rock song that has a lot of motivational and epic notes and beats that really invigorates the spirit and creates that idea of HERO!!!!  And no, that is not an exaggeration.  It is a song that really doesn't need much more explanation.  (This is on my exercising playlist.  Somehow, I can run 1 mph faster when listening to this song and not feel more exhausted.)
Inversely, we have OPM's ED ""Hoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru"", which...alright, I don't know what to say about this.  I'll be honest, it's a song that sounds like it belongs in a generic romance anime because it's sung with a lot of sparkly and 'pretty' bits that doesn't feel right in this series.  Honestly, who thought this was a good idea?  This is the one part of the soundtrack that just doesn't make sense to me.  
One Punch Man is a show that really looks at all aspects of the word ""hero.""  By creating a character that challenges the idea of a hero by skipping the horrible backstory, intense training, and has no limits or weaknesses, it creates this innate flaw for itself that makes a lot of what the show tries to do by creating these deadly and/or world ending situations into something that doesn't seem like much of a threat in the end.  Which might be the point, but it doesn't really feel entertaining cause I know for a fact that Saitama is just going to come in a couple minutes later and beat the enemy to a pulp without breaking a sweat, or tearing up his rather...epic outfit.  It has this clash of comedy and seriousness that feels uneven and rough at times, and has a very hard time of finding a mix of between these two ideas simply because of Saitama's existence.
That being said, OPM is a show that does deserve a lot of its praise because it has not only because it has great aesthetics, but also because it has characters and a story idea that while has some pretty major flaws, is still done in a way that is entertaining and well thought out.  Personally, I don't see OPM as being my favorite show or deserving its extremely high rating, but is a show that does is worth watching and the time to sit down and look at.  Now if you'll excuse me, I still haven't done my 100 squats and situps yet for the day.",7,PyraXadon

                ------IT MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS------
First of all, I must say that I normally don't like Japanese humour at all. It is quite immature, slipshod and shallow, like American humour. However, One Man Punch surprised me big-time with it's unexpectedly excellent surreal humour and  witty references to shounen animes and American super-heroes. The humour in anime is really smart and presented to the audience very efficently.  
Main character of the story, Saitama, is the crucial element of the humour in anime. He is portrayed opposite of shounen anime protagonists literally in every aspect. He has a quite simple appereance, he is bald as a
                  protagonist! Can you believe that? He is the protagonist and he doesn't have that famous cool hair! Also he doesn't have those flashy anime costumes. He just have a simple yellow costume with red gloves and cape. He doesn't have a logo on his chest. 
Another important thing is, unlike shounen protagonists, he doesn't have a meaningful, dramatic origin story. Simply, 3 years ago, he saved a boy from an evil crab man. Then he realized that he should be a super hero. Also, he didn't even have a job. So, he could have spared his time for training. By the way, his big secret behind his invincibleness is just an ordinary workout plan. Not an extraordinary, hard training like other anime characters do. It is just a workout. Then, after all these trainings(!), he beats his enemies with one single punch. Nothing else, just a single punch. No one ever made him to push his limits slightly not even once in the entire anime. Eventually, he got bored with his superhero career. He has reached his full potential in 3 years easily. It is another clever irony to shounen anime. It mockes with them in a great way. 
Except for Saitama himself, this fictional Japan is also designed perfectly for surreal humour. Names of cities are just alphabetical letters, you know, ""A City, B City"" etc. Villains just randomly show up and mess up with cities all the time. The villains are just all the same and they're all absurd characters, fits well with the atmosphere. If you think villains are awkwardly funny, they are nothing compared to heroes in this fictional Japan. Their attitudes, styles and names so wacky, they'll make you laugh. There is no logic behind them as it should be. For example Mumen Rider, a C class hero, is just a guy who rides bicycle. Even S class heroes(top class heroes) have some weird ones, they look like a joke such as Pri Pri Prisoner, Metal Bat, Child Emperor, Watchdog Man, Pig God and much more.  
Technical elements such as visual effects and sound designs are executed amazingly. Action scenes are dynamic and gripping, flashy enough. The great thing about these scenes are, they are mosty hand-to-hand combats. They are much more gripping than weapon fights. Soundtracks are great and fit well. They're heavily metal music influenced.
Lastly, I must say a couple of things about a common critique. People complain about how the story is repetitive and predictable. It is true. In fact, this is how should be. It is not a shounen anime, do not expect some ""twists"". That is the joke. Saitama will always be invincible, he will always beat the enemies. He has reached his full potential. He is not making progress like other protagonists, actually he does in terms of fame but that's another thing. All I am saying is, this anime is focused on it's humour, not to the plot. You should seek for good references and absurdity rather than an interesting plot. 
Anyway, I am looking forward to the next season. That's all...",9,EpicSaxGuy

                Alright, so the premise of this anime is about a hero who is basically unstoppable, as he is able to defeat virtually all his enemies with one punch - hence the title. Now you may be thinking, ""Watching a show about Superman minus any known kryptonite sounds kinda dull"". Well, this show is rather like ""What if Superman walked around in his costume and people still thought he was Kent Clark?"". If that interests you, read on.
Our protagonist, Saitama, is a self-described ""guy who's a hero just for fun"". As the story goes on, various characters are introduced who seem to take this hero business
                  much more seriously than Saitama, who really doesn't give a shit. While everyone is freaking out and obsessing over hero related things, Saitama is pretty nonchalant about the whole thing. The buildup to various conflicts is really entertaining, and you will often find yourself in anticipation for the usually laid back Saitama to arrive.  There is also more behind the scenes that isn't clear yet, paving the way for as of yet unannounced sequel. The story arc does feel a little too short, but that doesn't take away from the story. The premise of the show itself is much more entertaining in action.
The art and sound are quite well done, it's not jaw dropping but is nice to look at and listen to. The fight scenes are the best part of it all and look great.
Many characters are introduced and none of them feel particularly corny. Some have immeasurable power and others are your Average Joe trying to be a hero. All of them were entertaining, though all but the main characters and some of the villains have a deep backstory, which some other heroes could use. They are strong characters but it didn't really deliver on hearing about some of them as much as we would like to.  
That said, they help build and drive the world around Saitama. While he may not truly care about being a hero, there are plenty of others who do. This contrast is the driving force of the plot. It can easily turn from a bit intense to a bit more lighthearted and humorous, though it never feels dark or all that serious, largely due to Saitama.
You will likely not find yourself worrying about that too much about character development while watching the anime. It is gripping and you may find yourself binge watching it. With so little time we didn't have much of a chance to see many characters grow as people very much - except for Genos, Saitama's disciple - although they are very entertaining and already have interesting personalities.
You may enjoy this if you like action and a cast of characters that do a good job of supporting the plot and the main characters without overshadowing them or being little more than background noise, as well as lots of poking fun at silly tropes, and a mostly easygoing and fairly straightforward story.

                From where should i Start about One-Punch Man a.k.a Saitama-kun.
Let start from what i see at starting of the series................at the first look of the series poster i remember that i have seen this main bald character  many times during visiting many manga sites but  because of his pain egg face like looks it never bother me to read it and now when i think about it i thanks god that i have not read the manga at that time and can enjoyed the anime more.
i also want to admit that during watching it's  first 2 episode i was thinking of
                  dropping it cause it don't amaze at starting but after 3 episode the interesting comedy and scenarios kick the story and at time i reach the 7 episode it's addicts me to watch for the next episode.
sadly anime has only 12 episode
Story: 10/10
Story at first view look to pain and simple (a super hero with a power to destory any villian with only one punch.... ....yes only one punch that's it). but after 3  episode it entertains how the hero is unhappy about it.
Art:10/10
One thing i would say that the changing looks of saitama- kun from simply plan egg face to attractive superhero look give the anime a whole new level.
Sound:10/10
 all OSTs soundtrack in the animation  is to good giving  viewers  a better scene during normal scene to a hardcore fight scenario.
Character:10/10
all the character are unique with a parody personality and each character never let you down in entertainment.
Enjoyment:10/10
you will surely enjoy this  series after each episode or i say you will  be addicted to it after each episode.
Overall: 10/10
I highly recommend all of you to watch this anime even if you are new to anime or does'nt like shounen anime  that much.

                Silly.  Ridiculous.  Absolutely glorious.  This is a satirical jab at every action anime/manga trope out there.  Every tired old immature cliche is used... just slightly incorrectly.  Godlike heroes?  Check... sort of.  Ancient sealed evils?  Yup... more or less.  Calling your shots?  Well, yes...  Fan service?  Oh dear god, I'm afraid so, and I'm so sorry.
One Punch Man is written on three levels.  On the surface, it's another cookie cutter anime about talkative heroes beating the crap out of talkative bad guys.  Well...  Mostly the other way around, really.  Below
                  that, it's a cutting bit of satire which pokes fun at the entire genre's nonsensical nature.  Delve further, and there are disguised bits of character depth and social commentary.
But overall, it's just fun.  Go watch it.",9,Hoochfox

                Ever since I was a young kid I was into the idea of a superhero being the perfect example of an individual. This idea however is gone after watching and liking superhero series where the hero is not perfect but is actually the ideal such as Batman for not being perfect. One Punch Man puts the final nail on that coffin and doesn't hold back in using the hammer. 
In relation the thing I liked about One Punch Man is its characters which include mainly Saitama the One Punch Man and Genos the Cyborg Sidekick.  Saitama is an example of the overpowered hero in
                  the final stages of long series of superhero stories and arcs who is so powerful that no one can beat him. unlike Superman or Dragonball  characters who enjoy having their power and have a ideal personality Saitama has a more realistic personality. He is like a person playing a MMO and gets to the highest possible level and the game is no longer fun anymore. This property is what makes Saitama a much more deeper character and makes the story more refreshing.
Genos is a really strong character and represents the hero who is strong but can be easily beaten because he is not OP and is prone to heavy damage. Genos personality that develops is what makes him a strong character. The story mainly centers around the two characters I mentioned but everything else is not that strongly developed in my opinion which is why I think this series would need a season two.
The art of One Punch Man is top notch were fight scenes in each episode are done with amazing detail and quality. Some of the most epic scenes where amazing and had me watching the episode again and again. The music was pretty brilliant and made those scenes way better. I do wish they added more to the soundtrack as it seemed rather short.
The Enjoyment level of One Punch Man is good  I have a relative who is not really into anime but enjoyed watching this series with me. I think this was due to the superhero theme and some of the parodies that can be found among the heroes and villains.",10,Cyborg_Dragon

                Going into 2015 everyone and their mothers were hyped for One Punch Man. And to be fair, who wouldn’t be excited for this comedy/action/parody animated by the venerable studio Madhouse? Even the animation staff considered One Punch Man to be a passion project, as they turned an otherwise average budget show into one of the best looking titles in recent memory. But was all this hype too much? Could One Punch Man possibly meet such high expectations? 
In short: Yes. 
One Punch Man rocketed to the top of both MAL and IMDB and cemented itself as a solid mainstream title. Whether or not you are
                  a fan of anime, you will find some value in this show. The simple yet elegant premise of the vastly overpowered main character, Saitama, captured our imaginations and asked the question: How can this show function? Afterall, since Saitama can defeat enemies with a single punch, what happens to the tension, the struggle for victory? 
Let’s tackle that question in two parts. The first answer is that Saitama is part of a larger society of heroes, only this society does not recognize his talents. Whether it is by freak happenstance or sheer stubbornness, Saitama is unable to garner much respect among the hero elite. 
The second answer is that it doesn’t matter. This is a superhero parody that (literally) doesn’t pull any punches: Saitama is so strong and so powerful that he actually gets frustrated with defeating enemies too easily. His deadpan look when a monstrous enemy attacked (The famous “Okay” face) was hilarious. Saitama is so fed up with his power that even demi-god level enemies no longer phase him. It’s moments like these that make One Punch Man great:  Diffusing a catastrophic situation with nonchalance. 
Okay, with all this praise, then why only a 7/10 score? 
One Punch Man’s action scenes are a glorious spectacle, to be sure, but it falls short in a few categories. The first is the soundtrack. Sure, the opening is exciting and catchy, but the in-show music is a bit lackluster. Perhaps this was intentional to highlight the comedic elements, but I feel that it could have been more impactful. As is, the soundtrack didn’t really add much to the experience. 
The second shortcoming is the repetitive nature of the series as a whole. Saitama kills bad guys with ease. His slightly less overpowered sidekick Genos looks on in awe. Nobody else notices or cares that Saitama just saved the city. Rinse and repeat. Now of course it isn’t quite as simple as all that, since there are a plethora of other interesting heroes who fill the gaps and provide more character and worldbuilding. However, the basic formula stays the same. This show does not have any deep themes or provide greater insight into life as a whole. It’s just a fun action comedy and nothing more. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with that, but for a show to receive top marks from me, it has to have multiple layers. One Punch Man, for better or worse, does not. 
The third and final main flaw is that this show has some minor thematic identity issues. It seemed as if One Punch Man was going for a primarily comedic style, so whenever a character got teary and dramatic, it was a bit jarring and broke the immersion somewhat. Was the show a parody all along or was it just fooling us? Did OPM ironically fall into the traps of its own tropes? It’s a bit hard to say, but on a couple of occasions it could have fooled me. 
The final verdict on One Punch Man is still out for debate. Is it an instant classic or will it eventually be forgotten and supplanted by other great shows? Time will tell, but despite its flaws, I’m leaning towards it becoming a new anime staple.",7,blindfremen

                I literally just finished this anime and holy crap was it amazing. Now I originally did not want to watch this show, but since it was so hyped up I could not pass up the opportunity to see why it was so great.
Story: The plot centers around Saitama who's just a super hero for fun and has trained intensely for 3 years and developed the Big Show's one punch KO. He later meets Genos, a cyborg who is seeking vengeance on the cyborg that destroyed his home and family, and the two later become master and disciple. It wasn't until Saitama found out there was
                  an organization for heroes that he started to become one as an occupation and starts out as a C rank hero as he did poorly on the written exam, while Genos became an S rank hero. But what made this show entertaining were the action scenes and its comedy. Like it makes fun of the way Shonen's would have long scenes of exposition and Saitama just wants Genos to get to the point. But talking about the action scenes won't do it justice it has to be seen to be believed.
Art: It's MadHouse so you know the animation is going to be gorgeous.
Characters: Saitama is just your average person who has incredible feats of strength and speed and his hands the the major draw to this show. Describing this character is hard to do but to try to sum it all up as best that I can he acts very nonchalantly when fighting and just the acts in situations can give anyone a good laugh. Next there is Genos who is Saitama's ""student"" and is second best character of this show in my opinion behind Saitama. Other than that he's just an awesome cyborg.
Enjoyment: I cannot describe how much joy this show gave me. The final battle is hands down on the best I have seen in anime.
Overall: One Punch Man is a show about superheroes that has a hint of parody thrown into it. The characters a all enjoyable and you just get invested on what threat is going to come our main characters way. So I highly recommend this show if you are a fan of superhero shows and action anime.",9,Anthony_DiGrande

                One Punch Man was quite a unique and refreshing experience, albeit quite far from a perfect one. It’s flaws are apparent and certain points of the show can be rather mundane at times. In spite of this, One Punch Man is a show that rarely fails to put a smile on my face while watching it. It’s intent is to lampoon the absurdity of overpowered characters and superhero tropes in general, and in doing this it manages to craft a new path of its own that is filled with style, flashy spectacle, and endearing quirkiness. It may have its shortcomings in terms of maintaining everlasting
                  appeal over its course, but it nonetheless does all it needs to do to stand on its own two feet.
Our hero for fun, Saitama, is the center of attention as well as the selling point of the show itself. He is the embodiment of everything One Punch Man represents and what it has to offer. He fights not on the behalf of others, but because he can. It’s unfortunate for him that he’s so damn strong that no villain has a chance of making him flinch, or holding any sort of fight, and this makes Saitama both fatigued and rather bored of his daily routine. This alone is enough to sell the experience to viewers, and to propose an underlying wonder of various instances in most other stories involving superheroes. To start off, the routine of arrogant and ostentatious villains meeting their demise by the hand, or should I say “fist”, of a mellow, half-eyed bald guy in a cape is done in such a comical fashion that is not only humorous, but immediately envelops Saitama as a character, as well as what One Punch Man intends to evoke. We have to wonder if the strongest superheroes we know and love have ever fallen in the same boat as Saitama, deprived of any challenge of exhilaration, and ultimately questioning the point of it all. This is a concept which is both humorous and a breath of fresh air in regards to superheroes, making for a very suitable approach on the topic. However, the question that lies now is if this one concept is enough to carry the show all the way through its duration.
The answer is no. Because it is a one-note gag in where the outcome is pretty much the same in all instances, it would become repetitive and exceedingly mundane to rely on that one gag entirely. One Punch Man luckily manages to refrain from this trap. It refreshes itself by introducing various new characters to add more flavors to the experience, and building on that of Saitama’s. The first character to come to mind is Genos, who serves as a foil to the main character. In contrast to Saitama, Genos is dedicated to his work, and is extremely loyal to Saitama in hopes to achieve his own agenda. This also paves way for some rather funny and amusing interactions between the two. Saitama often gets sick of Genos leeching onto him and blabbering about his ambitions, while Saitama himself tends to silently dread over his own problem. This makes for a great chemistry which keeps the viewing experience alive, proving that One Punch Man has more to offer than a single gag repeated over and over.
With that said, it’s a shame that some other characters don’t get that same amount of fleshing out as our two main heroes. For other characters, we have Tatsumaki, a petite, ill-tempered girl with psychokinetic powers. There’s also Puri-Puri-Prisoner, who is the standard and generic stereotype of a homosexual male: being very feminine. These two along with many others don’t receive a significant amount of development and are seemingly only there to fill in the gaps with more personalities and flashy action scenes. This isn’t a bad thing though, far from it in fact. But I still feel as if this is where the consequence of One Punch Man being a premature adaptation of its source really stands out. Variety is always acceptable, but not to the point to where it feels like padding.
Thankfully there are certain side-characters which stand out from the rest. One example is Speed-o’-Sound Sonic who, after his humiliating defeat from Saitama, labels him as a rival. He actively pursues Saitama on a frequent basis in hopes for vengeance and redemption, which leads to plenty of rather humorous and amusing moments, not even limited to the fight they had which started the whole dilemma. It either leads to a trivial but endearing face-off, or into another situation entirely. In addition there is Mumen Rider, a hero on a bike who pedals to the face of danger, only to get his ass handed to him in the process. What’s significant about his character, however, is that he is ironically one of the biggest sources of inspiration for Saitama. Mumen Rider’s dedication to keeping everybody safe despite how weak he is, puts Saitama in wonder of what true heroism is. Saitama’s significant development as a character highlights that the show isn’t merely a vessel for simple jokes, but provides an actual story to get invested into.
Saitama himself is a notoriously well-rounded character, contrary to what his appearance might imply.  In addition to his apathy towards saving the day, his personality is like a normal human being in nearly every relatable way. He has a routine of chores, plans for the day, and plenty of personality and subtext in his dialogue. In fact, if most other characters in the show received the amount of attention as this, I feel like One Punch Man would be successful in offering the completely polished experience it deserved.
With all of this said, how well does One Punch Man live up as a parody? To begin with, to parody means to imitate a particular concept or style, and to exaggerate it for comedic effect. It goes without saying that the existence of Saitama himself fits this idea quite well. The exaggeration comes from Saitama defeating villains in a single punch, and his boredom with the whole concept of being a hero. The comedic effect comes from both the absurdity of the bad guys and Saitama’s apathy. But where does One Punch Man live up as a parody beyond this? Unfortunately this is where the whole attempt to parody typical shounen falls short. The show predominantly revolves around Saitama’s character arc, his frequent encounters with villains, and verbal exchanges with different characters. The whole purpose of being a parody is seemingly gone to waste once Saitama encounters his first epiphany. Many of the jokes from there on out feel rather arbitrary, as if the writer had lost interest in writing a parody and decided to write very standard jokes which offer no insight on the concept of heroism in general. Saitama’s arc is a good thing by itself, and other characters are certainly a joy to watch as well. But after the first few episodes, One Punch Man really feels like it took some steps backwards in terms of what it could have achieved.
The visual department of One Punch Man is good enough in and of itself. Animation is very fluid and well-choreographed as expected of Studio Madhouse, and has the added benefit of being very flashy. Additionally, the character designs manage to look distinct and capture the extravagant nature of the show without looking overly simplistic. There’s plenty of flair to be seen in the designs from Genos’s cybernetic anatomy to Sonic’s sleek attire. By contrast, one-note villains are given a relatively simple and goofy design, indicating that they won’t be seen for long. More prominent villains are more complex in appearance, yet colorful enough to stand out. The characters’ personalities and roles in the story are clearly reflected in their designs, which is the perfect approach for the kind of show One Punch Man is, and so I truly commend the original artist for his work. 
The artstyle beyond this is lacking, however. The backgrounds have very little to no flair in how they’re designed, being little more than average photorealism. They’re crafted in such a way that mimics real life, and are actually somewhat appealing visually. But the problem is that it conflicts with the more cartoony designs of the characters, thus resulting in a fairly lackluster presentation. Particularly, the city which Saitama resides in is a rather dull and boring sprawl of grey hues. With how much flair is put into the character designs and action sequences, this area sorely lacks creativity or vibrance, and comes off as a lazy choice on part of the producers. Other shows like Space Dandy and Gurren Lagann are wacky in roughly the same vein as One Punch Man, and manage to have a far more polished visual presentation with backgrounds that fall in line with the proper visual style, and at certain times looking far better than One Punch Man ever manages. Even Boku no Hero Academia, a show with notably more similarities to One Punch Man in concept, displays some creativity and polish by giving its backgrounds a comic-book feel to them. With how tonally consistent these shows are, I don’t see much reason for One Punch Man not to conform to this approach. It gives me the impression that the team over at Madhouse put a strict focus on how to make the character models and animations dazzling, and just ended it there.
And so with all of this said, One Punch Man may not evoke anything particularly meaningful throughout its runtime. And it certainly falls short of being a parody as mentioned earlier. However, the one major question regarding One Punch Man in spite of all this would be: is it worth watching? As far as I’m concerned, the answer is yes. The humor, likeable characters, and exhilarating action sequences are sure to keep viewers satisfied, and at the very least makes One Punch Man ultimately an entertaining and worthwhile experience. It has steps forward and steps back, but the overall product is a success in my eyes and is feel-good watch that I would warmly recommend to many.",7,AltoRoark

                He is strong, maybe even the strongest. And his name is Saitama. He and his faithful android sidekick, Genos, are the heroes City A deserves.
1) Let's first talk about the atmosphere. First of all, the art is superb. Well drawn characters, buildings, effects and so on. There are a number of cities named after only a single letter - City A, B, C and so on. Each city is protected by the so-called ""Hero Organisation"": a powerful syndicate consisting of strong candidates for heroes, ranked in different hero classes (S, A, B, C). The sad part is that the cities happen to get smashed almost
                  every episode. Saitama and the rest of the heroes give their best to keep the cities and citizens safe from impending doom, which could be waiting from any direction. We have an interesting and simple story and also great animation by studio Madhouse. The result would be 10/10 for both the Art and the Story.
2) Now comes the sound. The first thing that caught my eye was the flashy opening (The Hero by JAM project). The lyrics scream Power all over.
We couldn't want more from the voice actors and music directors, everything fits perfectly, by my opinion. The only thing I disliked with the sound was the ending credits, but I guess I can ignore that in the final result of 10/10 for the sound.
3) The characters. Without these amazing characters, there would be no show. The main characters are, of course, Saitama, the ""hero for fun"". Later in the show, we are introduced to Genos, a human cyborg sworn to become stronger, by any means. As he notices Saitama's strength, he immediately becomes his sidekick and disciple, hoping to become as strong as his master. Later in the show we are also introduced to more heroes, and also villains, let's not forget the hideous monsters and citizens. Look forward to the beach babe. Simply top, 10/10.
4) Enjoyment 10/10 - The hype! I waited every week for this show and watched it the first chance I got. That's how big the hype is, I couldn't wait for a dose of pure awesomeness. This was one amazing experience, the fighting scenes are off the charts spectacular masterpieces to watch. It's so well animated that it's hard to track what the actual f is going on. Look forward to episode 12.
5) Overall 10/10. No worries, everything was spectacular. I will be waiting for season 2 and I suspect that a lot of One Punch Man's viewers are, as well.

                Before I start this review, let's just channel the epic ""ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNCHHHHH!!"" from the opening song because I am obviously not over the One Punch Man feels.
I'll be completely honest and it took me a while to get started on this anime because of all the Tumblr posts that I've been bombarded with by OPM fans...I just see a bald guy with a ever-so-bored cartoon face wearing a yellow/red superhero suit with a cape. A CAPE. The ultimate cliche superhero outfit yet. 
I thought it was going to be a typical comedy, silly anime of a bald dude winning fights with just one punch. But
                  boy was I wrong.
It was a HILARIOUS, action-packed masterpiece of a bald dude winning fights by DESTROYING his opponents into a scattering bloody mess with just one punch. And I loved it.
STORY; 
You have the life of your average Joe turned superhero after rigorous training to the point where he lost his hair and became bald before becoming the strongest man on earth. It can't get better than this right?
I've heard plenty of OPM haters saying how typical and predictable the plot is which makes it 'boring' for them to continue watching. I understand their point for it is comparable to other action anime which are more drama-filled but to me, those additional plot-lines will become baggage if placed into an anime like this. It is because of it's simplicity that we can enjoy the crazy-awesomely animated battle scenes and indulge in the characters' hilarity. 
As a spoiler-free description of the story by my personal opinion, I feel like I have been transported back to my childhood watching Ultraman + a lil bit of Naruto with a blast of Dragonball. If you don't feel the excitement of watching superheroes defeat monsters and bad guys that you may had as a child when you watch One Punch Man, boy...you must be a plain child. 
ART;
Right from the get-go, aka the first episode, I was overwhelmed with the amazing animation. I would highly recommend everyone to watch it in 1080p or you'd be missing out in all the crystal clear art that would put many other action-anime to shame. 
It's clearer during battles or fights especially when we move through the scenery, following the flow of the destruction or attacks before we see the smooth movements of the characters even at a high-speed panning. I have to give credits to the animators for taking so much detail in every frame which would have been awfully exhausting but it resulted in a great animation for an action-anime and I 100% appreciate that passionate effort. Simply stunning.
SOUND;
Come on....I started this review by mentioning the OP and I am going to repeat myself with the ""ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNCHHHHH!!!!!""
Man that was epic! I love it when an opening song is able to grasp the actual feel and concept of the anime so well. It just puts it out there how detailed the staff members are to put together this anime piece-by-piece from taking care of the art all the way to its soundtrack. The ED is not an exception where I feel that instead of playing with the major epicness of the OP, it mellow down to remind us that Saitama is...human. He has a quaint little apartment and he returns home after kicking ass. I like that little aspect where even the strongest superheroes have their moments of normality.
Oh and don't get me started on the actual OST for it is flawless. Then again, if an anime does not have good sound, it is almost blasphemous as bad art. 
CHARACTER;
Let us all take a break and make a big applause to Murata Yusuke and ONE for creating such an epic yet, seemingly normal superhero; Saitama. This is probably the first time I find a bald anime character so damn attractive. Ehem~ Anyways... I honestly love how they created Saitama and Genos to balance each other out. The latter is introduced as the 'handsome' one who is prone to be more popular and attractive than Saitama and could have easily been the protagonist of his own story but nope: here, he is just the sidekick to the caped baldy. 
I have to say it is hard to find the characters' personalities overlapping with each other meaning that they are mundane and that is not the case. Predictable, yeah but they are all far from plain. We have a bald badass with a cyborg sidekick and later we get a slice of Naruto with a Ninja who gives me the Sasuke vibes except he is more...cheerful and smiley in a creepy way. What can I say...you got to have your Ninjas one way or another. 
OVERALL;
Thoroughly, I enjoyed this anime to the point where I devoured it in a single day. I've seen and heard plenty of anime fans trashing on this anime by saying it is 'trying to hard to be funny' or that it is predictable and boring but honestly, I can't see that at all. It is a wonderful series that I regretted not watching any sooner but since I've finished it, I can proudly say that I have not had such a refreshing action anime in a long time. After all the heavily-plotted anime, One Punch Man makes me feel like I have just opened my windows for the first time after being cramped in a dark dusty room; smelling the fresh air and freedom of an anime not conformed by super detailed plots and other baggage and just focusing on being badass. 
You don't need tear-jerking scenes or flashbacks of hardships or huge character developments to create an epic show.
Sometimes, you just need bald superheroes and ugly monsters destroying cities with their guts splashed onto the asphalt. 
Two thumbs up and a standing ovation for that!",9,Amaranthyz

                This is a very creative new anime. You will enjoy this anime if you have an affection for action packed theatricals. I was going to give a 10 but there is one problem. The characters have no backstory!
Story: 10
The story is about an over powered protagonist trying to make himself known to the world. He encounters having an apprentice and fighting lots of battles mostly ending in one-punch.
Art: 10
The art style is very well drawn with no noticeable errors.Sound: 10
Excellent and this particular anime has a great sounding theme and opening songs.
Character: 8
The protagonists are told to have very dark past and in particular the apprentice. But after one whole season we do not have any information on One-punches past at all. (I'm sure done intentionally.) All we are told is he was able to gain enormous psychical strength over 3 years. Also the main antagonists are not directly identified until being ""suggested"" in the last episode. 
Enjoyment: 10
Personally I love action packed anime. Despite many similarities to DBZ, I found that this anime did not draw out needless storytelling. 
Overall: 9
As I previously stated I could not give this anime 10 due to the lack of character development. I understand that the background of the characters will be revealed in the next season. But in every single T.V series I have watched where the single most important backstory is held back for so long always ends in disappointment. (LOST for example) I do not expect the next season to be better but far worse.",9,Animeaddict5

                It took me a while to get into One Punch Man, mostly because I thought it was just a comedy-show that had a one-off one-punch joke. Much to my delight, however, I was mistaken. 
One Punch Man is indeed about a superhero, Saitama, who is so strong that he can run as fast as a speeding automobile, dodge projectiles, jump so far he practically flies, and can defeat any enemy in a single punch; much to his dismay. He wants nothing more to be a hero, and draws no greater joy than the thrill of the struggle of life-or-death combat in the name of justice
                  and peace! ...but he kills everything in one punch. 
Beyond that, however, One Punch Man is both a satire of, and a love-letter to, superheroes in general.  Those behind it's production understand the themes of the genre so well that the show and manages to simultaneously mock and celebrate every aspect of the genre. 
More surprisingly, however, is that there actually is a plot! An honest to goodness story lurks under the jokes and fight-scenes, which the anime only begins to touch on; the manga it's self has only recently begun to delve into what's been going on in the background of the setting, and the broader problems and threats to the world Saitama has made it his hobby to protect. 
If you do not enjoy superheroes/shounen, then you'll probably not enjoy One Punch Man. 
If you do enjoy superheroes/shounen, and especially if you're looking for something that's simplistically brilliant, something that manages to be simple without being dumb, then you owe it to your self to watch, read, smoke, eat, and breathe One Punch Man.",10,Krinkle_Fries

First Impressions
So we’ve got parody of superheroes with a M.C. who takes out his enemy's with one punch and its apparently considered to be the savior of anime. What could possibly go wrong?  
Side note, this has been edited on 3/3/16                                                                                                                                                 Story, 6/10
One Punch Man is an okay parody on the super hero genre. it has this very bare bones “monster of the week” kind of plot. 
One punch man basic plot  didn't really bother me that much because this is a parody show and when it comes to parody shows you really do not need the best story out there you just need something basic to keep the plot going. When it comes to a basic plot to keep the story going one punch man dose this very well.
Also while watching this show I had to ask myself did I find this entertaining. Yes I did find it entertaining because at the end of the day that is what a parody show is supposed to do 
 Now one negative I have to say about One Punch Man and this is probably me nit picking but 
as a whole one punch man  runs on a singular joke, which can  make it loses its steam very fast . You might as well call it one pun.
Speaking of it running on one joke which did bother me a bit because you would think that a parody show would have more jokes than just one joke. But what should I have expected from a title like one punch man. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                             Character's, 5/10 
 The M.C. is overpowered to the max. he just an average guy who want to be hero for fun and fight strong opposition.
The side characters are quite lively and some what interesting. 
They are pretty much parodys of super hero type would see in comic books.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Art, 8/10 
The animation is fanatic to say the least with its lovely backgrounds and well animated fights. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            Sound, 6/10
It has a great op that matches the show and a good ost that fits the shows tone.

The story of One Punch Man is simply hilarious. It pokes a lot of fun of the traditional tropes of an shonen anime. You know a hero trains to get stronger, loses, finds out there is a big boss, loses, gets stronger, filler, gets stronger, and eventually beating the big boss for the grand happy ending leading to another big boss or season 2. This show does none of that. Instead our protagonist, Saitama, breaks all of those rules. He is a hero for fun who is extremely overpowered to the point he is bored of fighting. For a second, I thought Saitama was
                  struggling with his humanity while exploring deeper ideas besides finding an opponent worthy of fighting.I guess that’s just me. Saitama is joined by a cyborg named Genos who has a very decent story as well. It was quite shonen-ish, but great overall. I’m not gonna go into too many details because who needs a long ass origin story or explanation. Just know when the adventure begins, be prepared to enjoy the journey because I did.
Animation: 10
IT’S A MADHOUSE! MADHOUSE is simply amazing, I don’t know what else to say. I don’t think I have ever seen a bad Madhouse show. The animation is flawless, crisp, and simple. The OK Saitama face is definitely a highlight along with just about every scene Tornado is in. I left it for you to laugh at. LAUGH WITH ME DAMN IT! LOOK IT IS MADHOUSE…MADHOUSE IS NOT GONNA LET YOU DOWN. THE ANIMATION IS VERY PLEASING TO THE EYES BECAUSE IT IS MADHOUSE!
Music: 10One Punch Man 5.jpg
ONE PUNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Listen, yall this is one of the best opening theme songs I have ever heard in my life. I’m not exaggerating it is as simple as that. “The Hero” will get you so pumped, so hyped, so prepared to take on the world and punch stuff! I scream the One Punch part every time I hear it. Jam Project knocked it out of the park with this theme.
JUST WATCH JAM PROJECT PERFORM IT LIVE! IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
[This is where the youtube link would be to see it live.]
ISN’T THAT AMAZING?! This song alone gives the music score a ten! BTW the ending theme (“Hoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru (星より先に見つけてあげる)” by Hiroko Moriguchi) is pretty awesome.
Here is that theme for your listening pleasure.

MAIN CHARACTERS
Saitama – The strongest hero in the universe point blank, I am declaring Saitama the strongest human in the anime universe. In order to become a hero, Saitama went under an intense training & diet regiment to obtain his goal to the point he went bald. He has acheived that goal and you would think he would be an egomaniac. WRONG. Saitama is a laid back, care free, frugal, hero for fun that world doesn’t seem to notice despite Saitama saving the city frequently. Saitama is the king of training and sales at the supermarket all at the age of 25.
Genos – The lone cyborg willing to get stronger under the training of Saitama. Genos is very loyal, but he is extremely serious like most shonen characters. His origin story created the classic “20 words or less” rule which I find very amusing. I was thinking the show was gonna shift more towards his story at one point. If this show as about Genos, this would have been your typical anime about one character’s journey to retribution.
SUPPORTING CHARACTERS -NOW listen I am not gonna name every single supporting character because EVERY SINGLE SUPPORTING CHARACTER IS FREAKING AMAZING! THEY ALL ADD SOMETHING TO EACH EPISODE! IT may be a little moment or a one liner, but damn I gotta admit this show made each one of the supporting characters feel important when they were on the screen. I absolutely loved the way this show treated their supporting cast because each one of them could have an episode or an series or OVA about them. Mumen Rider is hilarious while Handsome Mask the other word for a male rooster! The heroes association alone could have an anime & I WOULD WATCH EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.
Additional Mentions
1. A huge thank you to Shingo Natsume for directing this anime and making One Punch Man everything it is supposed to be.
2.  I had thought that left me a tad conflicted. While Saitama is extremely powerful…ok over powered, would I be rooting for him if he was the villain of the anime? I think the answer would still be yes. Saitama is likable and I think that’s what sets him apart from antagonist that are considered cheap (I’m looking at you Aizen). What do you think?
3. Second season please?! PLEASE?!
Conclusion
One Punch Man is simply amazing. It was a wonderful ride that pokes fun at the shonen genre along with tropes of anime. The story isn’t something too memorable, but it is hilarious. Everything else besides that is perfect. I can understand how some people may not like OPM since everything ends in 1 punch & the comedy may get a bit repetitive sometimes due to the punchline is the same despite a different setup. Besides that, One Punch Man is an amazing anime that I highly recommend you to watch!
Saitama can beat just about anyone…yep I said it. GET ON THE SAITAMA TRAIN

                What does it mean to be a hero? 
 This is one of the questions that are explored as One Punch Man progresses on. This series goes from a shallow shounen parody to a romp that is much more interesting than its earlier stages. As I just mentioned One Punch Man gets a lot better as it goes on and becomes increasingly compelling and funny.
 Let's start with what we know, One Punch Man is a seinen anime that parodies much of the shounen demographic. It was based off a manga that was based off a web comic. It debut as part of the Fall
                  2015 lineup and has been met with large acclaim and was able to break into the top 10 highest rated anime on MAL. 
   With all of that praise, you would think One Punch Man would be a freaking masterpiece. Though I don't think it's amazing, it's still a very good anime that is definitely worth watching for everyone. 
 So what does One Punch Man do right? Well it's very entertaining to start out, the action was very cool and had amazing animation and music to go with it. I mean that opening theme song is just plain awesome. The voice acting was very good and the music was cool and went well with the fight scenes. 
The animation was great, it had a great sense of being fluid and there was very good use of color within the animation and art. The comedy was generally very good and supplied numerous chuckles throughout the series. Overall the presentation of this series is impressive at the very least.
   Now story and characters, oh boy this is where One Punch Man falters a little bit. The characters were pretty good but I felt a few of them could have used more development I would have liked to know more about a notable few or at least give them some more screen time. The story is well.....a tad underwhelming. I mean the plot is basically Saitama and Genos within their career at the hero association. I feel there were some opportunities for interesting sub plots but unfortunately they didn't come and it came across as a little one dimensional. 
   I also felt a couple of the fights, while awesome, were a bit anti-climatic, I'm not gonna spoil why but I felt this happened a bit often. However the final fight was pretty awesome.
   In the end what is their to say? One Punch Man is a funny, action packed, and enjoyable ride that supplies entertainment and is practically begging for a second season. I will probably check out the manga until that happens but I reccomend One Punch Man for all people who just want to see what all of the fuss is about.",8,711nono

                Fair warning their will be spoilers and also a TLDR section followed by my full review.
TLDR: An amazing anime that blew my expectations to the moon and back.
Story : One Punchman's story might appear generic, but it is actually filled with depth as it manages to tackle the them of ""What it means to be a hero"" while seeming like a simple parody of shounen battle series. 
Art: Unique and Breathtaking
Sound: WAAAAAAN PUUUUUUUUUUUNCH
Characters: Although Saitama and Genos are the main focus and receive the most development the rest of the cast is unique and memorable each contributing to overall show.

Full Review:
Story(8): The premise of this show seems simple at first, Saitama is a hero so strong that he takes down every opponent he faces with one punch(hence the title), and he strives to find someone who is worthy of fighting. Although this might seem shallow at first, which it would be if this was all their was to the plot, One Punch Man brilliantly executes this premise through its underlying theme of ""What it means to be a hero"" as well as parodying many shounen battle series along the way. All of the characters in One Punch Man have very unique and different designs, whether it be Genos's android body of Puri Puri Prisoners Muscular fabulous doublechin. Regardless of how bulky or ridiculously powerful any character might look though, they are always leagues below the simply designed generic looking character that is Saitama. This is not done to simply parody shounen battle series, but it is also done to tie back to the theme of the show. What Saitama lacks in appearance he makes up for in character. Saitama is not a hero to gain publicity and be acknowledged by others, as in shown plenty of times, with not only the speech he gives but, through his actions, ex letting other heroes take credit for the work he does(SeaKing and Meteor). The use of the Super Hero association creates a way to clearly demonstrate how other heroes are simply only in it for the fame. This is demonstrated perfectly by the top of rank 1 Amai Mask who disregards people of ranks below him and only cares about people in his rank because they effect his image. The show also gives us a subtle way of noticing the true worth of characters through Saitama. Saitama frequently and quickly forgets every hero he passes, but the first hero he remembers(to my memory) is Mumen Rider, a generic looking biker superhero in c class. This gives the audience I reminder that it is not power and fame that makes a super hero, but character. Although One Punch Man does have it's share of hilarious moments through the use of Parody and witty banter, it is how the show manages to blend it's comedy and underlying themes together that creates a great amount of depth.
Art(10): I already had high expectations for One Punch Man's animation as the show was hyped beyond belief, and Madhouse has proven they can produce quality time and time again, but even so my high expectations were easily met and even surpassed. Normally when watching a show that has a great animation there is only one to two moments throughout the entire series in which I think to myself, ""Man that is some breathtaking animation"", but with One Punch Man this occurs every single episode.
Infact I will prove it: 
Episode 1: Saitama fighting the crab people
Episode 2: Genos's fight with the mosquito lady
Episode 3: Saitama's fight with the ultimate creation
Episode 4: Sonics fight against the bald army
Episode 5: Genos vs Saitama
Episode 6: Sonic vs Saitama(well it was sort of a battle)
Episode 7: The Meteor
Episode 8: Sonic vs Sea King
Episode 9: Mumen Rider vs Sea King
Episode 10: Saitama deflecting the spaceships bullets
Episode 11: Fight between Mezalgard and the S class heroes
Episode 12: Saitama vs Boros, aswell as Tornado redirecting missles
The best part about this shows animation is that the studio itself said that  One Punch Man only has an average budget, and the amazing animation comes from it's dedicated animators.
Sound(10): Many people discredit sound and what it adds to an anime, but although a great anime does not need an amazing soundtrack, it sure does help, and One Punch Man delivers once again. One Punch Man is has a soundtrack filled with high intensity songs that will excite you for it's great action scenes, somber songs that capture the atmosphere of lonely City Z and Saitama as a character, as well as hopeful inspirational music. The Opening and Ending of this Series are great examples of this. The audience is jolted with a high intensity op that I can't help but sing along to every time its plays and is one of my personal favorite openings of all time which gets you hyped for the awesome fights and then it closes each episode with a soothing peaceful vibe to demonstrate the loneliness of city z and Saitama life. The songs are used both appropriately and effectively as I would never thought I would be tearing up in a scene starring Mumen Rider, but the soundtrack made it so. I have yet to hear a song play that I don't instantly love and if that isn't a sign of an amazing soundtrack them I don't know what is. 
Character(9): For a show that has a main character who takes down almost any  threat that comes his way in one punch, it would seem like the characters in this show would be very generic, but One Punch's set of characters is far from it.
Saitama: At first glance Saitama seems like a very cookie cutter character, with his key attributes being he is bored and powerful. The key thing to note about Saitama's character though,  is that he is a parody of main protagonist's of shounen battle series. Shounen battle series protagonist normally only get character development through an increase in strength, Saitama in contrast is already overpowered, and because of this he grows as character through actual development. The main reason Saitama shines in my eyes is not because of his funny jokes, short attention span or his ridiculous strength, or even the great dynamic between Genos and Saitama, but it's his reason for being a hero. As I wrote about this plenty in the story section of the review, I will keep this short. Saitama's resolve as a hero is very admirable and leads to some of the most impactful scenes in the anime IMO. 
Genos: Genos is a very interesting character as he is one of the few characters that breaks the standard that One Punch Man characters who look awesome and have intricate back stories...etc actually have poor character and a bad heroes. Unlike other characters though Genos has very similar resolve to Saitama, and he is used to show clearly the audience One Punch Man's theme of ""What makes a hero."" He is immediately thrown into s class and is constantly pampered with gifts, even though most of his fame should actually be attributed to Saitama. Having this contrast in Status also allows us to see the corruption of the system that the Super Hero Association creates. But Genos is not only there to show how awesome and unrewarded Saitama is, he is a great character by himself. As Genos is not interested in fame and the politics of the super hero association, he truly shines in his strive to be a great hero as he believes that he is undeserving off all the benefits he gets and even though he is eventually overshadowed by the feats of Saitama his growth happens through his ability to keep getting back up and trying again.
The rest of the cast of One Punch Man although not receiving as much development each are memorable, even characters that barely receive any screen time. Creating a cast so large each with their unique character designs, and making us care about even the weakest ones ex. Mumen Rider is truly an impressive feat. Special shout out to Puri Puri Prisoner and Watchdog Man. 
Enjoyment: I can't think of any show in recent memory that I have enjoyed this much. OPM is easily my favorite series of 2015, and is (as I am writing this review) one of my top 3 favorite anime of all time.

                this serious is about an average guy just getting down in his luck and realized that all he ever wanted out of life was to be a superhero so after 3 years of training he does just that. I think this is just where it needs to be on the list because overall its an almost flawless show but I think it gets a bad wrap simply based on the fact that it is more based to be a comedic series. If you really like intense animes, it may not be for you. But it does have its fair share of awesome fight scenes. One
                  punch man is honestly one of the funniest animes and/or shows I have ever watched. It has a very basic concept if you couldn't tell by the title, that basically describes the show. But the way they develop this is so good and trying to fight these staggeringly powerful enemies all while going threw his normal life makes one punch man one of the top animes out there today.",10,Brenton_Madison

                This anime is pure enjoyment.
A comedy about an overpowered character that plows through anything, with one single punch. Not only is this particular anime executed well by the director but it really does shine a light about how absurd over powered characters are in some shows.
Looking at the character development, the main character definetly has a funny backstory which really gets backed up well by the plot.
Art and sound is great.
The only reason I'm not giving this a perfect 10 is because the characters one punch technique might become very repetitive and actually dull the plot. However if there's a second season, I'm pretty sure
                  the writers/director will think of alternatives and additions to keep you on your seat.",9,ColoredinMonster
30276,"
                How this show came into being (Webcomic - Manga - Anime) proves that all you need is a good story to get things off the ground. 
The show is an excellent parody on the Superhero genre While it doesn't contain 'a hero's journey' within it's 12 episodes, it does an excellent job of not making you care about the origins of the main character because there is simply so much of his craziness to enjoy. The Master/Disciple equation is fairly run of the mill with some great humor thrown in. Saitama equal parts Lazy, Eccentric, and Mature. Each facet comes to light under different circumstances
                  and not all at once, which leaves you wondering what his next move/thought is going to be.
The standout quality in this show is the animation. Studio Madhouse spared no expense in breathing life into Yusuke Murata's beautiful artwork. The fight sequences and character designs are crisp and clear and the show boasts a good background score to compliment the various situations (especially the fight sequences)
If you haven't read the manga, then please do so (it has advanced greatly compared to the show) if, however, you wish to keep yourselves on the edge of your seats and wait for further craziness, then with a show like One Punch Man, the wait is well worth it.",10,DemonKingRavan

                Well, it's time I wrote this.  Like most people did in 2015, I really enjoyed One Punch Man. 
Story(9/10) 
One Punch Man is based originally on a web comic. Its story is fairly unique yet simple. Like the title says, One Punch Man is about Saitama, a guy who beat any character (or object) with one punch. The story sounds kind of boring and that's because it's supposed to be. Ironically, a man  with so much power finds very little fulfillment in life.  Saitama is unemployed at the beginning of the series and lives in a small apartment for the duration of
                  the season. He is frequently seen doing groceries as well as other common chores.  Coincidentally, his attitude towards fighting villains is the same as small chores. Does his life matter? Okay, enough with the serious existentialism talk, OPM is a comedy more than anything else. Does it accomplish its goal of making the viewer laugh? Yes, the situational comedy is quite well done actually. 
Art (9/10) 
OPM looks like a mixture of modern anime and classic DBZ style anime. This unique style really adds to the show considering its superhero setting. Madhouse usually does a great job with having a unique animation style for every anime they animate.   
Sound (9/10)  
The opening to this anime is epic, so I watch it every time and the ED, by contrast, is much more chill. Where this show stands out is with its VAs. Makoto Furukawa who I have only seen in one other show does a great job voicing a character with little expression. He delivers Saitama's dry lines perfectly.  By contrast, Genos's VA, Kaito Ishikawa makes the character sound like he belongs in a serious anime. I have to give him props for delivering some of those lines without bursting into laughter. 
Character (9/10)  
I have a soft spot for atypical protagonists. Saitama is bored for most of his screen time. He does fairly average things and yet accomplishes astronomical results. As this pokes fun at Shounen, where training can help you get past any obstacle, Saitama easily defeats god powered villains with his only training being basic strength. Genos, on the other hand, is a try hard. He is very strong, but not the strongest the universe has to offer. He overanalyzes every situation in his mechanical tone. Humorously,  he looks up to Saitama because of his wisdom and strength when only one of those things are there. 
Enjoyment (10/10) 
People call OPM overhyped, but I really enjoy it.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys or absolutely hates battle shounen, or Fist of the North Star-style anime.

                This is my first review of an anime so i probably will just ramble, so if you aren't all that interested don't bother reading. Though i will try my best to say what i think about One Punch Man. so anyway... Sorry for bad english (i'm from belgium) and the rambling if you are going to read
Alright, One Punch Man. I specifically chose this anime because i can say why i like it, other anime are just: 'yeah its fine, story is good and all' but with One Punch Man i have real reasons! I read the webcomic and i've watched the anime.
Art: its madhouse,
                  if you never heard of it they are pretty much famous for there amazing art and animation but also infamous for ending an anime at episode 12. The art is beautiful and outstanding with very much detail, every explosion looking dangerous every, in facial expression you can clearly see their emotions and you can totally see Madhouse put their heart and soul in it
Characters: most characters are memorable, i forgot a few (not their faces but their name). Every character is unique and have different personality, Genos being one of my favorite because its funny how he takes Saitama so seriously and is so fascinated by his power and wants to be just like him. i guess this is poking a little fun at side characters or little kids wanting to be heroes? The bad guys are something else, for enemies that just die in 1 hit they are all pretty memorable i could describe and maybe tell the names (cause i'm really bad with names man...) of most enemies in the past 12 episodes and even the webcomic
The story: well you probably already know what it is, a guy named Saitama who is a hero for fun and kills everyone in 1 punch, you might think 'well thats kinda silly isn't it?' well it isn't i.m.p (in my opinion) its executed fairly well with jokes that you might think that is funny or just plain and that kinda kills it for some people. Thats why i'm giving it a 8 (-2 for the mediocre jokes), why an 8? well its all because of the fighting scenes
*Here are minor spoilers that just explains the fighting in One Punch Man*
The fighting scenes is one of the things thats hard the understand i guess (and 'm not saying my way of thinking is correct) but i will try to convince you why i don't mind them
Saitama 1 punching enemies: ah yes, the thing that makes the anime. in my view Saitama one punching enemies is a joke for saying some superheroes can just kill/knock-out the enemy with 1 hit but don't (for god knows why) you might argue that the fights become predictable but i must ask: 'if you watch a movie, read a comic, whatever. If the hero fights you know that 9 out of 10 the hero will survive in the end' so why bother having a 30 minute fight if you can just end the enemy in 1 hit? So in short: Heroes have the power to end it quickly but don't.
Saitama waiting very long to punch someone: then again, he takes a while to punch someone? this again is in my view laughing at heroes taking their time bringing more people in danger while the fight could have ended a long time ago. Enemies transforming into being more powerful the hero again takes a long time to killl him/her. and thats what One punch Man does right, its easier to see in the manga/webcomic honestly. the enemy take a huge amount of time talking about its past and how strong it is and how it will destroy or take over the world, the Heroes taking hits that doesn't make sense. And you can easily see that in One Punch Man. Why do heroes do that? Who knows! Atleast Saitama has a reason, he wants to find someone strong. So in short: again, Heroes have the power to end it quickly but don't.
*ENDING SPOILERS*
The fight with boros at episode 11-12 was the best example of this. Saitama mostly just tanked all of his hits and Boros was just powering-up a lot of times, Saitama on the other hand used extremly weak punches to just give Boros a fight he wanted so much, a fight where he could give it his all and in the end he finished him with his 'Serious series: serious strike' attack to finish Boros, but wait! he isn't dead (shai suprise) he didn't give it his all instead he is like half dead because his whole body is destroyed. see where i'm coming from? if you read the things above you should hopefully understand that this is an exact superhero fight. The hero takes punches he shouldn't have but isn't dead > the enemy power-ups like crazy > then the hero takes more hits > but in the end the enemy dies anyway
*ENDING SPOILERS ENDS HERE*
One Punch Man is hard to understand and i guess there is no real answer to it (only if the creator explains it) you should also know that this is a ""parody"" about superheroes and in most parodies the characters have a form of 4 Wall breaking. I guess i'm saying they have more common sense, but in One Punch Man they don't. They really think they're in their world and there is no other universe. i.m.p Saitama is the definition of a hero and does exactly what a hero does but in a way that makes him look ridiculous. And its so unique i love it
If i had to say one bad thing about One Punch Man is that he already is becoming a meme, people laughing at him because they believe he can't beat the strongest (i'm not going to say names here cause that will just cause wars) but i believe and i will keep believing that the whole point is, he could beat anyone with 1 punch, thats the joke. And please... just don't put him in fights with characters that aren't in One Punch Man. The only one who can beat him is the one that the creator wants him to be beaten by
But anyway, to end this review i will say: don't watch one Punch man if you're a Hero fanatic, if you take heroes too seriously, if you aren't open minded. You should watch One Punch Man if you know about superheroes but also make fun of them or don't take them as serious as other people, if you're open minded, if you just want to relax. And i highly recommend the Webcomic

                I went into One Punch Man expecting a show about a guy who's really strong taking out absurdly powerful enemies with a single punch, and that's what I got. 
The story is pretty simple, but it doesn't really need to be that complex. There isn't much one could really say about the plot that hasn't already been stated in the synopsis, everything is supposed to be taken at face value.
The characters are the highlight of One Punch Man. Each character is an overdone trope but done in an extremely tongue-in-cheek way which really works with the satirical nature of OPM. My favorite parts of the
                  show are when the characters start making fun of cliches that characters using like villains having overly-long monologues or characters intentionally trying to sound cooler than they actually are, it provides great situational humor and makes OPM all the more enjoyable.
As with most Madhouse anime, OPM has very refined animation. The art is phenomenal and I can confidently say it's one of the major highlights of the show. There's no comparison to be made between this and the webcomic.
While the soundtrack isn't anything all that special the opening and ending themes are very good and even some of the regular tracks played during the show are pretty good, too. Overall it's an average soundtrack.
How can I really describe the action sequences? They aren't out of this world balls to the walls amazing but you can't say they aren't pretty darn fun to watch. Anyone is sure to find one fight in this show that they loved, which is a pretty big feat for a show where the main character literally can punch away all of his obstacles. Overall the action very satisfying to watch.
I could recommend this to anyone looking for a decent parody of common anime tropes, although I don't need to because I'm sure everyone under the su n has atleast heard about this show.",8,eminemcome2syria

                One Punch Man is a story with a strong and loyal fanbase, and was the perfect candidate to become an anime. Did Madhouse deliver?
Story:
It's different. As a parody of the usual superhero/shounen genre, it manages to go where you'd expect to some extent. Still, the personal struggles of the main characters are interesting and unique, without losing the almost cheesy superhero parody feel that they were intended to produce. The story isn't really the point as much as the overarching concept, which is done very well. 8/10
Art & Sound:
Madhouse gives what we've come to expect from them in terms of animation, and maybe even a
                  bit more. With plenty of guest animators working on the project, it still managed to carry a unique style from one episode to the next, and it goes without saying that the fight scenes are outstanding. Easily the best thing about this series would be the fight scenes, choreography and all... Art 10/10
As for the sound, the opening song is an absolute perfect fit for the series, and I watched it every episode. The ending theme, however, wasn't the best fit for the series, and though it might be good in the right context, it just wasn't right for this show. The sounds of each punch, each hit, and all the destruction, are just a bit above average, and most of the voice acting is just a bit above average too... Sound 8/10
Characters:
It goes without saying that there are some very distinct characters in this show. That being said, there was a noticeable lack of character development through the show. It's hard to call this a bad thing, as it fits the premise of the series (being a parody of superhero shows) perfectly. There was also a very strong divide between the main cast and supporting cast, and again, this was deliberate and added to the style of the show. All things considered, the characters didn't have much to add to the show, but they certainly didn't detract from it either. 8/10
Enjoyment:
The reason to watch this show is purely for the enjoyment factor. The show grabs you in episode 1, and sends you into a different world where wacky and funny battles unfold on a grand scale. If you sit and watch it without over-analyzing it, the show is very entertaining without a dull moment. This is the sole reason I gave this show such a high rating. To be clear, if you aren't a fan of the source material already, the series might be a bit forgettable, but you'll enjoy it thoroughly while it lasts. 10/10
Overall, this series deserves an 8 at the lowest, and I'll give it a 9 for the constant enjoyment it delivers, and the surprising amount of emotion it manages to have nestled into 12 episodes.
Overall: 9/10",9,EclipsedArchon

                Even for an undeniably jaded anime viewer like me who has lost hope in parts of genre, I was convinced that I would dislike one punch man. However, I was so very surprised as one punch had me laughing and crying non stop. 
Story: A little bland and a bit predictable but soo fun never the less. 7/10
Art: Saitama, is beautifully animated as even the sightless expression change is brought to life. There are however a couple bits where it feels slightly of, but they pass very quickly. 8/10
Sound: POWER,GET THE POWER!!! Sound is perfect, I love the intro and the little quirks around each
                  fight. 10/10
Character: I want to be a Superhero, Saitama is by far the greatest hero the earth has ever known. 10/10
Enjoyment: I am prepared to do anything in order to become stronger. But I can’t picture myself even approaching Master’s power. Every moment is a constant roller-coaster ride, you will never stop cheering for the completely overpowered Saitama. 10/10
Overall: I still can't believe that I enjoyed it this much, makes it into my forever archive at a 9/10. If the story was  better and the art didn’t have those weird rough edges occasionally it would be 10/10.",9,dark0dave

                I enjoy ONE's sense of humor but sometimes it's hard to know whether he's poking fun at stuff or endorsing it. Moments of confusing morality and weird framing bothered me. Defeating a monster can be a source of comedy but also of inspiration and drama, which sounds like not taking a solid stance. The show ends up falling into its own trap of exploiting tropes which could be avoided by either cutting off all idealistic crap or integrating it better. About the animation, it varies from passable to good and when it wants, impressive. Not nearly as consistent as people claim it to be, but
                  as far as seasonal adaptations go, this one is surely among the best. Mob is far more cinematic and energetic all things considered while also knowing to handle tone better. Rewatching it definitely put me in a weird spot where I value the highlights more than its entirety. Still, fun and accessible.",6,Assthete

                One Punch Man!? Straight 10's across the board. Why!? Because it's awesome. I don't know how anyone couldn't like this anime honestly.
Storyline: A hero that kills everything in one punch, but truly just wishes he could find an enemy who can take more then one punch from him? It's so simply and yet it's so enjoyable.
Characters: All the characters are precious in their own way. Specially Saitama.
Art & Sounds: The art... is absolutely insane. I can't even begin to describe how intense the fights are and how crazy the art is. Take 5 minutes to just watch one fight on youtube and you'll definitely be
                  hooked. The sound is just as great, the publishers of this anime have done such an amazing job on the art and sound for this anime.
My Final Conclusion: Everyone should see this anime, seriously. Not much else I can say. Go now... watch it and bask in it's glory.",10,PancakePuncher

                I kept hearing about all the hype One Punch Man was getting so I decided to watch it and see if it really is good or was basically just another internet hype train that everybody just decided to get onto because it was the cool thing to do.
First things first, im really glad One Punch man isn't one of these long winded anime series that has hundreds of episodes and hours of filler content. It is quick to the point, we get introduced to the main characters very quickly and we get to see the extent of the powers almost immediately WITHOUT having to wait
                  for long drawn out battles with each character giving a long introspective about how he needs to get stronger to defeat his enemy.
One Punch Man is certainly a breath of fresh air in the way it handles this type of genre which is normally full of cliches and tropes.
If you have watched a lot of anime, you'll start to understand the sheer brilliance of the writing when it comes to parodying the genre, based on reading other reviews here some people completely miss the point. Watching each villain being built up as a hugely arrogant and ultra powerful adversary only to be easily defeated by ""normal"" punches from Saitama (The One Punch man) is actually hugely satisfying. It makes you wish that in some of your other favourite anime certain annoying ""placeholder until the boss"" type characters could get obliterated early in such a fashion so that we never have to see them again since in many cases those characters are not interesting anyway.
A constant theme of One Punch Man is about not being long winded, something driven home hard after Saitama gets annoyed by many other characters in the show who suddenly decide they need to give us 10 minute speeches about backstory, Saitama cuts them off and tells them to answer in 40 words or less.
As a result of the to the point fashion the story is told it gives studio madhouse a great opportunity to go all out on the art and animation. As the saying goes, the candle that burns twice as bright burns twice as fast and before you know it the spectacle will over before you have had a chance to grasp how good the quality of animation is. In my opinion Studio Madhouse have proven to be the leaders of animation quality, currently there is no studio that can surpass what they have done of late (Redline, One Punch Man, Black Lagoon).
Sound is really great, personally i love the high energy intro, the hopeful music that accompanies some of the battles of the lesser heroes (only to see them still hopelessly fail, which in itself is a great parody of the genre). The cheerful credits music and narration is great too. On a whole the Japanese voice acting is great. Studio Madhouse productions always have great music and voice acting.
There is truely nothing like One Punch Man in anime, so watch it for that reason alone. If you are a fan of Madhouse, it is easily some of their best work so its a MUST see. If you are a fan of fighting anime watch it, but make sure you understand that its a satire and parody, rather than incorrectly assuming the story lacks depth, if you grasp what the writer is trying to do you will start to recognise many fun themes that others have missed.
I recommend it highly and i really hope other studios take a hint and cut down on fluff and filler and give us less content at better quality.",9,BGCLeonK12

                One punch man is an adaptation of a webcomic by the author ONE. Lately it has gained alot of popularity and the reason for its great popularity is its plot.
Many of the great and well know anime like DBZ , naruto , one piece and bleach have heroes who strive harder and harder to beat their enemies but one punch man turns that on it's head, you see a hero(Saitama) who can't find any villian worth of his time and usually kills them in a single punch(hence the name one punch man).
Story:
The story focuses on our hero Saitama who tries to find any opponent who
                  is worth of his time and power. It also foucses on its apprentice Genos who wants to become more stronger.
Art/sound:
The animation is done by Madhouse which has made many great anime like Death Note , Hunter X hunter and Parasyte. This is why the are amazing and beautiful.
Characters:
All the character are likeable and have their own charm.
Enjoyment:
The series has many funny and action moments which keeps the show from getting dull.
Verdict:

                One Punch Man is one of the most disappointing and overrated animes out there. If you're looking for an action packed, thrilling anime to watch, I can assure you that this isn't what you're looking for. Every episode feels like a repeat of the last as each follows the same predictable formula. The protagonist Saitama is no doubt the biggest mistake in the show. He is portrayed as emotionless and nonchalant making it hard for the audience to connect with. Compared to the other characters in the show, he is lacking especially in terms of character development.
Overall, One Punch Man is a great watch if
                  you're looking for something action packed and thrilling. Character progression, exciting battles, an energizing protagonist, it has it all. A very decent watch.",6,jmo456

                Many bad shows are a case of good ideas poorly executed. It’s rare for a show to miss its target in the premise, but One Punch Man does. For a while, the series assumes that powerful characters are a problem in fiction.
They’re not. Anyone who’s concerned with how intelligent or strong or agile a character is should stop talking about fiction. These aren’t role-playing characters. They don’t have charcter stats and skill trees. If a character has a trait, it’s supposed to be meaningful to his personality.
A character isn’t defined by how strong he is but by simply being strong. It’s not hard to write
                  intelligent characters. Just have someone solve mathematical problems and put the answer in the character’s brain. It doesn’t matter that Max Cohen is a walking calculator. What’s interesting is how his genius affects his worldview and isolate him.
In the first episodes, the series piledrives into the ground the idea that overpowered characters are silly. I don’t think anyone thought otherwise, so we get something like Kill La Kill only with less charisma. Everyone looks like Arnold Schwarznegger. Everyone screams and every conflict is solved with one punch. Mr. Krabs also makes a cameo appearance in the first episode, but he’s transformed into another bodybuilding loudmouth.
There’s only so much you can do with a character who solves everything with one punch. Thankfully, Saitama is not as bland as his skill. He’s a great protagonist with a personality that’s connected to his super-strength. It’s almost psychological how bored he is of all the macho bullshit, but he’s also vain and wants the attention. The anime remains satirical and exaggerated but the protagonist has a realistic psychology.
It’s Saitama’s desire for stardom and everyone’s megalomania that shapes the main arc. At this point the anime abandons making fun of obvious targets and starts creating actual absurd situations. The villains are rarely interesting. Their purpose is to always get knocked out by one punch. Rather, it’s stardom that’s being satirized.
How ironic it is to discuss the Bandwagon Fallacy in a review of a popular anime? Popularity doesn’t prove quality. Just because you don’t have a diploma from an Intelligence Institution doesn’t mean you’re stupid. Yet we take these things very seriously. People are often more curious about whether my writing is popular instead of how good it is.
Diplomas or popularity don’t prove you’re talented. They only prove someone thinks are you are. Popularity is even worse than diplomas, though. Diplomas are given by people of authority who take their topics seriously. People can be easily swayed.
The most popular people on earth aren’t the hard workers or the life savers. The most popular people are those with the highest social value. They are the charismatic, the beautiful, the entertaining. Taylor Swift is more well-known than a person who saves a baby from a fire. That’s because Taylor is charismatic, beautiful and writes catchy songs. Just because you save a person from a fire doesn’t mean you’re a desirable social presence. It gets even worse with peolpe who Famous Because They’re Famous.
The series is wise enough not to pull that strawmen. There are these silly celebrities, but here the popularity of most heroes are justified. They’re both charismatic and talented, but they’re never as talented as Saitama.
That’s because, unlike them, he never worked on being popular. He became the strongest hero because he only put effort into being strong rather than being popular. That’s the cost of talent. Sometimes you focus so much on it that you forget to make people notice you.
There’s a major rise in quality once the series finds its satirical target. While it presents it well, pointing absurdities without resorting to strawmen it can never attain a sense of madness it aims for.
In the first episodes, it thinks it will get by having everyone scream and some stupid ideas like a muscular crab and a kabuto macho dude. I used different words but this is the same idea. It tones down later but the series never gives up on this.
There are some interesting visual ideas, but almost everything is given the macho look. It fits with themes, but after the 10th dude who looks like sirloin steak it becomes boring. When Tornado appears and we get a cute girl it’s a shock.
Just as they are all macho dudes, their personalities are all macho. Besides Saitama’s everyman personality and Genos, who acts like he walked into the wrong anime, characters blur into each other. It makes for a consistent world. At least the anime tried to find variety in macho bullshit rather than pretend their kaleidoscopic. Still, it makes for a world that’s always less exciting than how the characters perceive it.
One Punch Man isn’t amazing and quickly stops acting like the Most Hyped Show of the Season. That’s a good thing. It’s when it realizes its limitations (the world is monochrome and tame, overpowered characters aren’t worth satirizing) and its strengths (satirizing celebrity culture, finding variety in macho bullshit) it becomes a worthwhile show that has enough personality to appeal to those outside the genre.

                ONE PUNCHHHHHHHHHHH...Ok I'm good. Sorry that was a must do :). Let's get this review started.
Story - 7: This is just my opinion, but the only story plot that I found in this anime is how Saitama and Genos are climbing up the rankings and aiming to become the strongest hero (although we already know who the strongest is....hue hue). Each episode seemed to be very episodic too with a new case brought up that would be solved in 1 episodes or 2-3 for a couple of the final few arcs. Hence, I didn't find this story line to be as interesting as it could've
                  been but I mean, I have no idea how the story could've been better too but what I'm saying is, the story line did not really hook me onto this anime and if it wasn't for the other aspects such as the characters, art, sound etc, I would not have rated this anime as highly.
Art - 9: Madhouse studios. What's there more to say? The art is absolutely spectacular, along with the animation and Madhouse studios living up to their name. Breathtaking animation and some scenes seriously worth pointing out such as the Genos vs Saitama practice fight and the final LORD BOROS vs Saitama fight. (I'm trying so hard not to spoil anything)
Sound - 9: The background music, opening themes and ending themes were all wonderful. Opening theme, probably the most hyped opening I've ever heard. There is this specific main background music that has been played many times during fights and epic moments but I don't know what the name of that music is. Those that have finished watching should know which one I am referring to because it is quite obvious that one certain background music standed out from the rest (If someone is kind enough, would you please tell me the name of that BGM? Thanks ^.^). Anyways, that background music adds on to the epicness of those scenes so perfectly it leaves me speechless and with my jaws open so widely.
Charatcer - 10: Saitama is probably among one of my favorite MCs of all time that brings humor to the audiences without fail. However, there is one character that I want to point out that stands out so much for me and made this series even better and that is Tatsumaki, or known as Tornado. (P.S.: Her outfit, mmhm.. Ladies out there, you might not want to walk out in the public with her outfit or even try to cosplay as her because uhh... You do realise that she doesn't wear any undergarments right?) With every second Tatsumaki had screen time, I enjoyed it so much because of the humor that she brings to the table, I love her so much. #waifumaterial, and of course, her sexiness...... I mean i just can't ignore that outfit of hers. The other characters were awesome as well but Tatsumaki standed out the most to me.
Enjoyment - 9: As I have mentioned countless of times above, I enjoyed this anime so much and this anime brings a smile to my face with every episode because of the comedy. 
Overall - 9: This anime is almost perfect and definitely stands out from all the anime this season. However, it is still a long shot for me to give this anime a 10/10  rating because it really takes quite a lot for an anime to be rated as a 10/10 masterpiece in my books. As mentioned above, the story line can be made a little more interesting although I have no idea how because I am not creative >< Also, this anime has to have more episodes because 12 episodes just isn't enough to tell the entire tale. Hopefully there will be a season 2. 
Sorry I couldn't summarize this review into 15 or less words. Please forgive me Saitama-sensei :(",8,XyriaLight

                One Punch Man serves as suitable entertainment on the shallowest of levels, though its repetitive comedy and presentation prevent it from standing out on many other levels.
One Punch Man starts out on a moderate note, with the joke of Saitama’s overpowered physicality growing old before the end of the first episode. From the start, this is a problem, as even less acclaimed comedic series like Baka and Test and The Devil is a Part Timer have fast and furious first episodes, where comedies usually try to reel in their audience by establishing character dynamics, introducing multiple avenues of comedy (ranging from misunderstandings to ill pre-conceived
                  notions) and more than a single named character. Though the first episode contains a fight with a crab, a fight with a giant, an extended dream sequence and a showcase of sidekick Genos, it feels very scant on promising material or even immediate comedic or visceral sustenance (outside of the sakuga, but I’ll get to that later). When Genos is introduced things become a bit more interesting, as his back-and-forth with Saitama resulting from their juxtaposition in goals, fighting styles and ambitions makes them able to play off each other very effectively. Another couple of episodes are carried by this, and for a while their sort-of buddy cop routine works somewhat effectively, repetitive scenarios aside (Genos fights his heart out, Saitama wins with no difficulty at all).
However, problems become more prevalent after the introduction of Speed of Sound Sonic. The hero association is introduced, and there is little excuse for Saitama to not know of this for several reasons. Firstly, as the series itself points out, the hero association is subsidised by the government, and Saitama must have had to have paid tax at some point in the past. Secondly, he must have seen other heroes near gigantic monsters at least a few times. Finally, if the association is so well structured, with satellites and monitoring systems all throughout the world, why hasn’t Saitama been noticed? (Disclaimer: I have read the manga up until where it is now, and his scapegoat is an insufficient reason for the public’s inability to report him).
When any level of scrutiny is applied to the mechanics of the world, it falls apart, and the excuse of it being a parody just isn’t enough for this negligible world building. With the plot essentially consisting of a sequence of events as Saitama and Genos rise through the ranks, One Punch Man choses to take the unambitious route of having the series serve as a comedy and action series almost exclusively.
However, the comedy of the series, which even more so than the action was its main draw, was another area where the series ultimately falls into the category of hit-and-miss. When it parodies the super sentai and American comic book hero genres, it worker relatively fine on a comedic level, though no thoughtful subversions or critiques are made with this self-awareness of its labels. However, when it isn’t pertaining to the very watchable and even charming relationship between Saitama and Genos, it resorts to the most painfully unimaginative anime humour, and these extended cringe-sequences can take up to 5 minutes at a time, which even a good joke couldn’t sustain. As was mentioned above, the series uses Saitama’s lack of intelligence and quick thinking as a source of humour against Genos, but when he’s on his own the scenes feel like the uninspired moron-shaming the something like Family Guy would resort to. The depiction of homosexuals as sexually aggressive sociopaths isn’t even parodied at all, with the writers seemingly using a clearly sexually abusive man as a source of humour, made worse when you consider we are supposed to be rooting for him. Even the loathsome groin jabs make an appearance, and in the earlier parts of the series at that, though they are played more effectively than one might presume.
Another of the plentiful problems with the later episodes is that the supporting cast, mainly the other S class heroes, are introduced and then immediately set to fight in dangerous situations, with episode 11 being taken up mostly with these new, though not particularly interesting characters fighting unnamed aliens whose weakness is so painfully obvious that the entire episode is skippable. To add to that, with the exception of Sonic, every villain in One Punch Man is interchangeable; sure, they have slightly different goals, but they’re essentially all cocky giants who command henchmen who seem to dominate until they are easily dispatched by Saitama. A couple characters like Tornado of Terror and Sweet Mask seem interesting, but they do nothing more than gloat and occasionally attack enemies of little consequences while Saitama does all the work.
Thematically, One Punch Man is a very dry series. It sometimes likes to throw around themes like “People will judge you based on your history and appearance instead of your actions.” However, these are simply repeated from time to time with little sense of thematic progression. This theme is introduced, and immediately becomes a dead end, and as a result, One Punch Man only really has something to say if the viewer is willing to turn their brain off.
One Punch Man’s visual presentation is another mixed bag. The action sequences are fluid and the lack of weight to them makes One Punch Man feel like a video game at times, though this is appropriate for Saitama given that his victories are often with the ease of button pressing. Visually, any scene involving the main character works, as his character model is sufficiently loose for it to change depending on the tone of the scene without feeling distracting. On the other hand, like with Attack on Titan the inconsistent production quality is covered up with tight shots and speed lines, however unlike there it doesn’t function as effectively because, as a generally light hearted series, wide and open shots would feel more natural. The few instances where there are crowd shots feature many off model people for up to 10 seconds, and even vehicles seem deformed as a result of the action scenes clearly being given priority over the in-between ones. The character designs are fairly on-the-nose typical of super-heroes, with the serious, detailed and (widely considered) attractive Genos acting as the straight man, while Saitama serves as the spanner in the works with his intentionally unspectacular but memorable aesthetic. When Genos, or many of the other characters move, they are often pudgy at distance shots, and the choreography of many fights leaves viewers with little sense of distance or speed. The fights against the Deep Sea King and aliens in the second half were particularly disappointing for the most part, usually consisting of a series of stylish stills and speed lines which, while reminiscent of charming older action shounen, detract from what are supposed to be serious confrontations.
The colour palette for the series is below average by modern standards in terms of breadth, with simple base colours dominating the character designs and backgrounds. The series misses a big opportunity here, because though this works well for Saitama, giving Tornado of Terror or Silver Fang a more sophisticated depth of lighting would assert why they are so respected and bring greater contrast to them and Saitama. Outside of the fight scenes, the series often has difficultly with the mobility of larger, more detailed monsters, as the story boards that treat One Punch Man like a theatrical outing couldn’t be brought to life without the time and energy put into something akin to a Makoto Shinkai movie. The series shot itself in the foot to an extent with the bland angles and framing, because had the series shown monsters rising from behind, rather than at the front where everything has to be drawn, it would have both made them more imposing and increased the fluidity of these creatures. Instead, the monsters’ movements are stiff, unnatural and greatly contrast that of the rest of the characters. To add to that, the content of the fights often feels like there were forced attempt at lengthening them (Saitama is running away from Genos… why?). A potentially even bigger problem would have to be the visual pacing; with One Punch Man being a Madhouse production in name only, dozens upon dozens of freelancing key animators were hired to direct individual scenes as short as 10 seconds. The jarring shift in art style, matched with the directionless story often makes episodes of One Punch Man feel either dry or bloated, messy and confusing and, at worst, like nothing is happening.
The standouts scenes that have made One Punch Man famous in the visual department are its occasional use of Sakuga animation, which is to say, when then animation quality considerably increases for a brief period under the watch of specific key animators, such as Tetsuya Takeuchi or Nozomu Abe. The first and final episodes of One Punch Man in particular has a few of these, with many of the staff from Space Dandy creating sequences specific to them for maximum effect. However, this ultimately serves as a double-edge sword, as though they may be exhilarating for about 30 seconds, these sakuga moments are intercut between with so little grace and consideration for pacing that the scenes feel random and uncoordinated, with the final battle between Saitama and Boros essentially being a long sakuga compilation, rather than a well-structured fight. To add to that, the effects work surrounding them isn’t up to par, with the dust clouds lacking the fluidity or realistic motion of a product from P.A. Works or Ufotable. One Punch Man’s animation during action scenes make for some entertaining gifs, but not satisfying battles.
The music of One Punch Man starts out on a strong note, with the second half of the first episode containing a powerful, catching and uplifting song during Saitama’s dream sequence that brings to life the unadulterated feeling of being a hero. However, this track is repeated several times over the later episodes, during training scenes, fights and even dialogue, outstaying its welcome before the mid-point of this 12 episode series has been reached, and being used to death till the end (even in the final battle). The OP is so on the nose that it feels obnoxious, representing the repetitive nature of jokes pertaining to Saitama and barely showcasing any of the more interesting looking characters. The lyrics are also suitably bland; like the series it accompanies, the opening song uses the label “parody” to excuse a lack of creativity and articulation. The ED feels like it belongs in a different series, with the various visual cues and vocals having nothing to do with One Punch Man, and “Sleep soundly…” doesn’t seem to pertain to any of the characters. Sound effects are dull and overused from the very beginning, with each “Clang” sounding exactly the same and some of the noises sounding outright off.
As a comedy, the voice acting in One Punch Man is serviceable, with Makoto Furukawa’s Saitama voice doing such a good job at reflecting his years of fighting pitiful opponents that it just makes the jokes feel more repetitive. Genos is well represented by relative new comer Kaito Ishikawa, who brings his focused and disciplined characteristics to the forefront, though the script and direction prevent him from displaying much range. Much better is Yuki Kaiji’s wonderfully insane and energetic performance as reoccurring antagonist Sonic, who steals whatever scene he appears in with his memorable mannerisms and fighting style. Mamoru Miyano as Sweet Mask is also good, though his scenes are too few and far between. The gem in the cast, however, would have to be the one-two punch of Saori Hayami’s wonderfully cold and manipulative Blizzard of Hell Fubuki (in spite of her appearance being little more than a cameo) and Aoi Yuuki’s simultaneously adorable and magnetically unpleasant Tornado of Terror, who possess the most personality of the cast.
All in all, One Punch Man is a candy coloured super hero punch up that sacrifices ambition and development in favour of using it for a quick joke stretched out into a 12 episode long series, which based on its current strong reception and awareness among the public, is likely extend even further. The humour quickly becomes uninspired and overdone, the story lacks bite and the presentation is hit-and-miss. It excuses itself as a parody or satire, though ultimately doesn’t function as either of those a lot of the time, resulting in a lukewarm experience.",6,AmbiguousMonster

                Undoubtedly the most popular anime this season, and possibly the whole year, One Punch Man is one of the most hilarious anime I've watched in a long time.  As an avid shonen fan, it was also refreshing to see a slightly different take on how the genre is represented.  
Story (8/10):
The story basically revolves around Saitama, your average, everyday hero.  While he may look normal, with a bald head and a lifeless expression, every villain he faces he defeats with one punch.  A typical episode formula goes as follows: a big, scary monster destroys a large portion of a city ->
                  Saitama arrives to fight it -> the monster is unimpressed by Saitama and attempts to assert its dominance by displaying its strength -> Saitama destroys the monster in one punch.  The punch line (heh) is usually when the monster hypes itself up, shows how powerful it is, only to get wrecked by a single punch.  It might sound like a repetitive joke, but the delivery of it varies between episodes, keeping the humor refreshing each time.  
Art (8/10):
I thought the art was pretty good for a shonen series.  The villains are drawn as large, menacing and detailed as possible, while Saitama's face is drawn as simple as possible, with literally just two circles for eyes and four lines for the eyebrows, nose and mouth.  This contrast greatly contributes to the punch lines in each episode.  The action scenes were animated quite well, Madhouse really showing that they are no strangers to action series. 
Sound (8/10):
The opening was pretty catchy for me.  In particular I liked the fast beat and high volume; it really gets you hyped for the episode.  The soundtrack used for the action scenes is used over and over again, but they suit the scenes quite well so I didn't find it an issue.  
Character (10/10):
The characters are what made the show for me.  Saitama, the titular one punch man, is a laid back, mostly expressionless guy who supposedly does his hero work as a hobby.  His laid back nature is the central point in the comedy, as his allies and enemies frequently accuse him of not taking things seriously, only to be taken aback as he defeats an enemy with a single punch.  His sidekick, Genos, is half robot, half human, who has a serious personality due to his family being wiped out in a monster attack.  He usually acts as the straight man to Saitama, sometimes even going along with his laid back nature.  As the series goes on, various other heroes are introduced, along with a ranking system similar to ones from other shonens such as Bleach.  These secondary characters help to keep the series from becoming stale, which would be the case if the show only centers on Saitama and Genos all the time.  
Enjoyment (10/10):
I remember how skeptical I was when a friend first told me to watch this anime.  I thought to myself, how could an anime that milks the same joke every episode be any good?  The humor was delivered perfectly, and I was definitely proven wrong.   It's been a long time since I've had this much fun watching an anime, and I enjoyed from start to finish. 
Overall (9/10):
If you haven't already, definitely give this anime a shot.  It's a fun, refreshing show that makes fun of various shonen and western superhero stereotypes, and it does its job exceptionally well.",9,uberguber

                'If you're looking for an action-packed anime with an unconventional main character, superb fight scenes, great soundtrack and well placed hilarity - one-punch-man is just right.  Saitama, the main character, is bald - and his nonchalant expressions can provide any situation with subtle humour that goes further than one would expect.  The gimmick here is that Saitama can defeat any foe with just one punch, and you might think that leaves very little room for a plot - well there is a plot, and it's quite fantastic. The brilliance of this story pivots not on Saitama's sheer power (which is way over 9000),
                  but on how his power effects others and his interactions with those weaker than himself. Furthermore, the main character does not struggle with the infamous ""will of fire"", but rather he suffers from an insatiable thirst for an even fight, or to defeat an opponent stronger than he is.
Although, this is a parody, it feels more like an actual effort to write a well thought-out story than some other trivial animes out there.' -DeeAd
+The visuals are spectacular, and a mix of vibrant explosive colours. Madhouse did a fantastic job on this production. The explosions are masterfully detailed. Movements are given great attention where fight scenes are actual fight scenes - not just a flurry of attacks (although that too can be found from time to time).
+The OST fits perfectly with the thrilling action, with blaring heavy rock encapsulating the tempo of most fights. But, also at moments of captivating emotion violons can be heard, and are quite effective in producing an encouraging and warm sound that will capture your heart. Also, the opening and ending songs are quite nice.
+The comedy hardly fails, and surprisingly is more mature than you'd expect in most cases.
- The characters may in fact be the weakest aspect of the anime but are still interesting nonetheless. You'll find yourself wanting to know some backstory to much of the hero characters; their abilities are very well done, and quite unique. Unfortunately some are quite ridiculous, and not with any comedic effect. Furthermore, due to the lack of actual difference in the abilities of the villains themselves - the show somewhat suffers here. This is where the anime lacks in creativity and ingenuity.",9,DeeAd

Do you like overpowered Main characters that have a good personality and can literally kill anybody with a single punch?? Do you like to see the main character make that one Evil guy that claims he is the strongest being in the universe turn into mush? Do you like anime intros that make you want to scream the song????       WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, If your answer was YES, then ONE PUNCH MAN is for you.
Main character is funny, Strong, fast, bald, poor and can kick anybody's ass.
The story was never meant to be AMAZING with plot twists
                  and amazing ending. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING, so that is what you will get in that show.

                One-Punch Man. 
Sort of difficult to rate because it is incredibly easy to be swept up by the hype and afterglow one experiences post-finish. 
I calmed down, thought carefully and in the end, I believe this show is a 10. 
It is not the 10 some people give that reflects perfection.
Mine is a 10 where the outstanding aspects greatly overpowered its weaknesses.
I would have no problem recommending this show. 
[Imbalance of OPM]
Jaw-dropping animation from incredible talents paired with a rocking soundtrack. From hearing my laughter at a precise time every Sunday, my roommates realized I was watching OPM. 
However, the story/characters are only passably good, due to the very nature of the comedy. Its wacky and lovable large cast lacks the character focus and development most top shows demonstrate. The protagonist, the man/legend, ""Saitama,"" is an invincible Gary Stu character.
It was as much of a parody of the super-hero genre as it was a normal representation of it. Saitama mocks the concept of a near-invincible superman but as a plot device, he is no different. 
How can you keep an audience hooked without the fear of loss? 
One-Punch Man certainly did by being supremely entertaining. The general humor hit the mark for a majority of watchers. 
A hype-packed opening! Comedic dialogue! Super-powered action! A relaxing ending! Then an episode preview!
Every single week!
Oddly enough, it is hard to explain what makes this show so good, without visually experiencing it firsthand. The basic formula looks like a decent vehicle for an extremely popular manga.
[Why is One-Punch Man Special?]
One episode left you with a huge smile, waiting for the excellence of the next episode. With one season, it delivered consistently amazing combat animation. 
The passionate efforts of the voice actors and the product of beautiful frames coming together.
Nothing is left to imagination, as we see a fist collide with an evildoer or a deadpan stare in the wake of an opponent's seemingly unfathomable power. 
From start-to-finish, the show made that all-important translation of source material to audience amazement. 
However, it is not without weakness. In transitioning to comedy, it often lost a sense of human, relatable struggle. While the show had its meaningful moments, it centered more around explosive passion and quirky character intros. 
Overall, it still became one of the most entertaining shows I have had the pleasure of watching.
Nothing about this show is particularly strange or alien, unlike some of Saitama's adversaries.
Whether you are a long-time anime veteran or someone who has just started, this series delivers. As anime, as entertainment, it is a shining star. A combination of gorgeous action, humorous characters, and lively pacing. 
My verdict is that the sheer amount of enjoyment OPM offered overshadowed its average-to-good character/story design, a factor that cripples most shows. 
It is a roller coaster of awesome entertainment that brings all sorts of watchers together for a good laugh and a fantastic ride.

                First off I would like to say that this is my first review and that it might contain light spoilers. Also, english isn't my first language, so I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this might cause you as the reader.
The reason behind me writing this review is purely based on the bashing it seems to be getting by people who seem incompetent of understand the overall premise of this show. Even though I feel that the aforementioned premise makes it hard to judge this show until we see the story in its entireness.
The core premise of this anime is: Saitama can beat anyone with
                  one punch, hence the name of the show.
People call it both predictable and repetitive, but that's because they aren't seeing the underlining plot. It's supposed to be both predictable and repetitive in some regards, because of the premise of the story, but as soon as you look deeper you find something more, a story about how extraordinary people struggle with their existence. Sure, there's a lot of comedy mixed in and some cool fighting scenes, which is great.
Saitama started out as your average guy, but he was tired of his job and his life in general, so he became a hero, for fun, but is he having fun? Not really. 
This is where I find it hard to review this anime before being given the conclusion of the story, how does this internal struggle continue and is he able to find what he's missing?
What I just said is even mentioned in the synopsis! And of course there's always going to be a few people who just want to hate this show because it's mainstream, but truthfully, it's worth a watch.",10,2Girls1Cupcake
30276,"
                The true hero arrives! 
Story is bare bones. Meet Saitama, holy crap he's strong, episodic problem of the week and it gets punched hard. There is no epic story line or grand quest to save the world. Just an average guy being a superhero. 
Art is amazing. Madhouse really went all out with this one. The fight scenes are glorious. The sheer impact and destruction of the attacks are the best I have ever seen. In stark contrast, the comedic scenes are so intentionally poorly drawn that it sucks the excitement away instantly. This is a very good thing. To be able to switch gears
                  from awesome battles to a dopey moron instantly is extremely hard to pull off. 
Music is very good as well. The opening is suitably epic for the strongest hero and the battle effects really bring it together. The ending is a bit underwhelming however. I'm almost convinced it was purposefully boring. 
Characters are one dimensional. Saitama is a hero because he likes it. That's really it. There's not going to be any character growth. No gut-wrenching decisions or actions that shape his viewpoint. What you see is what you get. Minor characters see his actions and may start to reflect on how to improve themselves, but this is never highlighted and has no bearing on the show.
Enjoyment varies for every viewer. Saitama is going to win every fight, without a doubt. There's no trace of tension or anxiety in the show. Some people will find this boring. Others will watch for the comedy reactions of the background characters. This isn't a show that's going to appeal to everyone.
Overall its a good show. With a better story and stronger characters it could achieve greatness. But for now it stays an impressive visual work that deserves a chance.",7,ToonShiba

                One Punch Man might be one of the hardest anime to review. This because it rejects some standard values by which we usually rate heroic animes or the Shonen genre in general by making fun of them. The excitement and the lust for battle typical of this genre is converted into boredom and this gives us interesting element to analyze which are usually bypassed by classic Shonens. What does it mean to be a hero and what is his relationship to the ""Other""? Does he want to be acknowledged? If yes, how much does this need for social acknowledgment influence our understanding of his value?
How
                  Nietzsche already remarked, when you donate to others you don't do it for pure 'good' reasons, you wish to be acknowledged as 'good' thus making it for yourself. In this sense Saitama is a heroic figure because he refuses to reduce his heroic status by the judgment of the other. Like in Camus' ""The Stranger"", the protagonist is a heroic figure which isn't understand by society and avoid normal societal normative judgments of behavior. He firmly stands for himself.
I believe One Punch Man is much more than witty commentaries and ironic mirrors of superhero trophes and motives: irony as a perspective through which watch our ideas of heroic identity and behavior. Why are we so obsessed by the hero and rhetorical myth of the savior? Which elements make the hero appealing and worth of praise?
If you want to dig deeper in one of the most repetitive and widespread archetypes of narration ever -- the superhero who saves us from the bad guy -- then One Punch Man is the anime for you. A dazzling picture of a normal man that doesn't have any real superpowers and yet is hero per antonomasia.",9,Moerbeck

                This review will probably get lost with all other Saitama fan reviews.
So if this review get a lot of helpful likes, I will take a plane to Korea, eat some ramen noodles with Yakisoba bread, and film myself eating it to make millions of people feel disappointed.
Ok
I find this show ridiculous. Which makes this show ultimately amazing. The plot is to unique and hilarious that it made me want to fly to Japan and fight a couple of Cyborgs.

                And so it has finally came to an end , One Punch Man the anime that made me feel like a child just grinning and waiting in anticipation for each new episode to arrive so that i could witness Saitama beating the living crap out of a villain and this is a feeling that i will miss. But was this anime worth all its praise and hype ? It totally was and if you haven't watched it yet then well you my friend is missing out on something great.
The story of One Punch Man is a parody and satire of every single Action Shounen Anime
                  that is out there along with its community , it barely takes it self seriously and is something you should just watch for mindless fun , there is plenty of thrilling fight scenes that is accompanied by hilarious comedy that makes this show truly something special. It is also a really well done adaption of the manga with almost every event following 1 : 1 with little to no filler , some of the fight scenes are extended as well and there are some extra personal moments for character building that i really appreciate props to MadHouse ! 
Characters are well pretty much what makes this show. They are all really enjoyable and hilarious , we have our two main characters being Saitama , a hero for fun which trained so much he has lost all emotions but in exchange he can one shot almost any thing out there and Genos a hero which started out seeking for vengeance that eventually became Saitama's apprentice due to how strong he is.
The interaction and banter among the two MC is jut hilarious to watch and they will quickly grow on you due to how charismatic they are which keeps you begging for more of their daily life shenanigans. The supporting cast in this show is really strong as well with my favorite being Mumen Rider and Bang due to how likable they were.
Next up is the Animation and Sound , Oh my god the animation quality is just top notch , the fights are animated fluidly with some of the best soundtrack to accompany it and when the punch finally hits you could just feel the impact of it due to how amazing the sound was. The voice actors does a really amazing job as well in voicing the characters that added a lot of charisma into them.
Overall , I would recommend anyone that hasn't watched it yet to go and watch it NOW , it does the manga justice with some of the best animations behind it and has plenty of hilarious moments that is unforgettable. It is not by any means perfect as there is minimal character development and a story that gets rather repetitive but this is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously and is just there the satirize Shounen Animes.",9,darkoinferno99

                If you're going to watch this show, my first advice to you, is to watch it with your brain turned off. If you go into this show analyzing it and looking for all the flaws, you better believe it's gonna have a lot of them. Why? BECAUSE IT'S A FREAKIN PARODY ANIME WITH A GUY SO OP HE CAN KILL ANY OPPONENT WITH JUST ONE PUNCH!!!! Do you really think this show is going to make sense? If you are the kinda person that enjoys analyzing all the shows you watch, chances are you won't like this show. But if you're the kinda person that
                  can sit back, turn your brain off, and enjoy a show for what it's worth. Than I think you'll love One Punch Man.
	Anyway, despite all I said at the start, I'd honestly say the show made pretty good sense despite it's concept. The story was simple, but unique at the same time. Especially as far as anime is concerned. A Superhero organization that ranks their heroes.......sounds pretty familiar to something else over in the states.
	Another thing I'd like to bring up. A character like Saitama, one that can kill any enemy with one punch...............you'd think that would actually make the show boring. Like there'd be no angst, because you just know that Saitama is going to come out on the top every time........but this show does it in such a way that it's just so entertaining to see. I was never bored for a second and I was constantly one the edge of my seat. So if you're one of the people that was avoiding this show due to that issue, believe me when I say that you won't be disappointed by the way they approached it. It was really well handled.
Con: The only major issue I had with this show is they replayed the same plot over and over. A city get's attacked by a monster. Heroes are falling one by one trying to fight said monster. And the whole time were just waiting for Saitama to get their and take them out. It was all done to build up the anticipation once Saitama got their, BUT i can see why they did that. I mean, if you have a hero that can take anyone out with one hit...........they gotta find someway to put people on the edge of their seat. I just wish they had changed it up. Do something a little different each time. I think they replayed that plot at least 4 times. And in a 12 episode show, that takes up a good portion of it. BUT once again, I can't deny that I loved every second of each of those plots.
	Besides that, there's not much else I want to say. All the characters were really interesting and fun. The turmoils that this show has really got me choked up a few times. Not gonna lie. And the climax was FREAKIN AMAZING!!! I binge watched this show 3 days ago guys, so when I finally got to the end and I had to wait for the last episode.........I got pissed at myself for not having watched it when it was all out.
	So overall, does this show have issues that could bring down it's score? Yes.  Do I give a crap about those issues? HECK NO!!! Going back through and trying to find the issues would only ruin the amazing experience I had with the show, and I don't want to do that. 
	But anyway, the fact that I know it had issues at all is the only reason why I'm not giving it a 10/10. Instead, my final score with One Punch Man is a 9/10. And I'd recommend this show to literally EVERYONE!!! Heck, I'm probably gonna even buy the series. I MIGHT EVEN START READING ONE PUNCH MAN ONE!!! That's how much I loved it :D",9,BChuck

                One punch man is no doubt one of the most widely known anime of all the time but it does not mean it is as good as its popularity.
The main problem for me is its story. There are 12 episodes with the coverage of such a little plot.Its just Saitama saving the world with of course ONE PUNCH.There are like so many questions left unanswered.I know that it is a comedy show but a heavy plot(more substance) could've made it better 
As for the sound....one word....AWESOME....the opening is just so great! Can't say the same thing for ending but soundtrack is great.
Now another thing that
                  that I don't like about OPM are its characters.Saitama is a hero for fun and then He wants to gain popularity now thats development for his character but its not that much,Genos is the second main character,he was impressed by Saitama's power and wanted to become his pupil to become powerful,why? Because he wants to take revenge of his family's murder by a cyborg.aaaand thats it there is nothing else about his past.Other characters are just worthy of calling ""other characters"", they are not much developed.
Animation is Amazing just Amazing.Sakuga is fabulous,Action sequences are awesome nuff said animation is excellent.
Entertainment is at its peak! Yes OPM is comedy gold,I enjoyed it thoroughly.Saitama's expression are really funny.
One punch man is great even if its characters and story aren't that good.I am not saying it's overrated but if it had better story and character it would have been much better.

                One of the best overall shows I have ever watched. This show perfectly parodies pop culture in many ways and provides laughs every episode. The writers of the show are truly skilled to be able to make a story about an all powerful hero interesting. The pairing of Saitama and Genos works perfectly. A common complaint is that the show ends up being predictable because ultimately Saitama can not loose but, this works in the benefit of the show. One Punch Man knows exactly what show it is and executes it perfectly. Saitama is just like us. He wants to be recognized for what he
                  does and regular stuff still bothers him. This makes him a very relatable character and creates an interesting story.",10,phillipbrule

                There are no spoilers in this review. My rating system counts story for 30% of the total, characters as 30%, art as 20%, and 15% for the sound. 
I give One Punch Man a 6.2 and I'll tell you why.
Story: 6 
The story in itself was not that great. Simply put, there are people who act as heroes and they protect the world from getting destroyed by monsters. The anime focuses on one of those heroes. The only thing that really makes this story slightly more creative is that the heroes have a rating system where the higher a hero is, the more respect he/she
                  gets. 
Characters: 6
I enjoyed the quirks and personalities of most of the minor characters in this anime, but I found the main character quite boring. Making the main character overpowered is acceptable to me as long as there are redeeming qualities, but Saitama had none. 
For example, the main character of Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon was insanely overpowered but at least he had an interesting personality and had to go through hardships before acquiring those powers. Saitama didn’t earn his powers and the entire season never bothered to show why he deserved them.
Art: 7
The art for One Punch Man was spot on for the anime. It didn’t blow my mind, but the style fit the anime. When there was an intense fight the animation looked completely different from when there was comedy involved. The monsters looked pretty epic as well. Even though I wouldn’t say the art was outstanding, it definitely carried the shallow story throughout the season. 
Sound: 8
The music for this anime, especially the theme song, was perfect. It really kept the anime interesting, and the sound, along with the art, is what kept me from dropping the anime all together. Without the timing of the music, the comedy of this anime would not have been nearly as good.
Overall: 6.2
After completing this anime, I honestly felt like I wasted my time. The driving force of this anime was humor but it couldn’t quite carry the deadweight of the lackluster story and boring main character. If comedy is good enough to carry an anime for you then you’ll probably enjoy this anime but it wasn’t enough for me.",6,eragon1man

                Okay this show blew me away.  It was fun, exhilarating, and the perfect genius mix of tension and predictability.  It is the most fun I have probably ever had watching an anime show.  Watching it through with Andrew was an awesome experience, and I would recommend it to basically everyone.  However, if you try it out and don't like the first episode, don't bother finishing.  I don't get how you can't like the first episode, but I know there are those close-minded people out there.
So the animation was beautiful, Japanese voice-acting was on point.  As soon as the dub
                  comes out I am for sure buying it and rewatching the series.  The only other two shows I have decided this same thing for is Your Lie in April and Hunter x Hunter, both shows I love which have dubs allegedly coming out in the future. 
Overall, I had zero complaints about this show.  It was self aware and hilarious, yet simultaneously being the most epic spectacle I have probably ever seen.  Highly recommend.",10,macdude95

How does one rate One Punch Man?  It has its flaws.  As a parody, it falls flat at times.  It reuses the same jokes, and not all of them are that funny.  The fight scenes are awesome but arguably suffer from their predictable outcome.  But even as I'm writing this, there's a very insistent voice at the back of my head saying ""I don't
                  care, I loved it.""
I think the final judge of this show is just how gosh darn enjoyable it is to watch.  The animation is phenomenal, particularly during action; the characters are fun and lovable; and most importantly the show seems to smoosh everything I enjoy about shounen and fighting anime into one package (dare I say, one punch?) without taking itself seriously for a moment.  I'm reminded weirdly of a movie like Pacific Rim or Godzilla.  You can argue the craft of these movies all you like, but at the end of the day, people are coming for the giant monsters ok, and if there's giant monsters, the movie has delivered.  That's how I feel about One Punch Man.  You're coming here for fun and entertainment, and you're going to get that.  A lot of it.  It's gonna be awesome.
At the end of the day, I think One Punch Man's greatest flaw is that there isn't enough of it.  Not only do I want more (I want so much more), but the show suffers from a lack of conclusion or overarching plot.  It probably made the right choice not trying to force in any arbitrary cohesiveness to bring its 12 episodes together, but I feel like it would have been much more suited for a longer running series.  I hope we see more animation for it in the future, as it really is perfectly suited for anime.
I have to point out, though, that when a series' biggest flaw is that you want more, it's doing pretty darn good.  I loved One Punch Man.  There I said it.  I loved it so much that any nitpicking I could do won't even make a dent in how much I loved it.  Give it a shot.  It's definitely a great ride.",9,spartakiss

                As far as story goes, I admit, it's quite original, but it gets repetitive too fast to the point that you get bored. 
About artstyle and ost no major complains here, very good artstyle. 
Than we have the character: the main character is boring, the author tries to make you laugh in every way, but it simply doesn't work. 
As far as supporting character some of them are quite good, but overall they are pretty insignificant, you will rember at most 3 or 4 of them. The foes are even worse, basically no characterisation whatsoever, just buff dudes waiting to be defeated. 
I didn't enjoy
                  one bit this show, maybe i don't get the comedy behind it, but I think I'm not the only one. 
The problem with comedy is too subjective, some might like it, some don't",5,punpunPolo

                Story: The story of One Punch Man is a story of satire, a man named Saitama who can defeat anything in the titular One Punch. The story is a pretty obvious satire, as the whole idea is pretty ridiculous, but it's also hilarious. It also builds nicely, starting with a few disconnected stories, before building into a larger arc.
Art: The art for One Punch Man manga is drawn by the fantastic Yusuke Murata, and the anime does a pretty admirable job living up to that. The action sequences especially really wowed me, and sometimes the sheer dissonance between Saitama's simplistically drawn chromedome and the imposing
                  figures of his enemies can be pretty fantastic. 
Character: The characters of One Punch Man all have varied and good designs. Genos and Saitama, as the mains, look amazing, and they're very likeable in the show. The monsters look awesome, in my opinion, and the other heroes are cool just because they all appear to immediately fit into one archetype or cliche, and you get to watch whether they fit it or not.  
Sound: I'm no expert on sound design, but One Punch Man sounded fine to me. The theme song is awesome to get yourself fired up, and though the dub just has one episode out so far, that seems pretty amazing as well.
Enjoyment: If my previous glowing praise hasn't tipped you off, I love this series. SO MUCH. I watched it with my 13-year old sister, and she loved it as well. The action is fun to watch and the comedy is hilarious. In the moments this show gets serious, it does so in a way that's genuinely touching.  I'd highly, highly recommend this series to anyone that thinks they might like it even a little bit, as it is literally one of my favorite pieces of media ever.",10,emchovy

                One Punch Man ワンパンマン Review *Re-posted*
Story (10/10) Masterpiece
The story for One Punch Man is simple and it's basically the main character looking for a satisfying fight and when you hear about such a plot the first thing that comes to mind is ""That sounds generic, boring or stale"". But guess what you might be right but it's not about that... it's about the execution and I don't think it could have been pulled off in a better way than this series did it. The creator could have easily made every single episode the exact way episode one was, but he didn't. Execution is everything and
                  the fact they we know how every fight is going to end and still be entertained is what drives it home for me. You can't deny the amazing fights scenes that has happened in the anime and you can't deny that from a story stand point the side characters like Genos are interesting and the creator didn't have to do that like I said before every episode could have been just like episode 1. Saitama going around One Punching everything, did you see how bored Saitama was in Episode 1? Yeah we all would have been that bored if the entire series was like that but it isn't. The story opens you up to a world filled with interesting heroes, their struggles, their stories and how is coincides with Saitama's. And yeah we didn't get to anything Garou related except a mention but you want an even deeper story? Go read the manga because what the character Garou has to go through is even more of a reason why it would be an injustice for me to sit here and give this anything lower than a 10.
Art and Animation (10/10) Outstanding
Outstanding and just a flat out masterpiece yeah there were some parts that were not adapted to my expectations but more where above and beyond it also so it makes up for it especially the final battle with Boros.
Sound (10/10) Masterpiece 
The sound in One Punch Man is a Masterpiece easily, the sound effects, the voice acting (JP VA is what I'm referring to just in case a dub ever comes out which it most likely will), and the MUSIC. The music alone for every single portion of the anime is completely amazing especially the opening theme song, yes I'm one of those people who never skipped it. My video player crashed one time and I had to start the video over it crashed right after the opening you know what I did? Listened to it again. The outro music I hear everyone giving a hard time and even I wasn't feeling it for literally half the the anime it wasn't until around episode 8 where it finally caught on to me it's a soothing song and it is what it is I like it also, its not bad what so ever I've heard bad before this isn't it. It just doesn't fit One Punch Man is all but like I said I got used to it and I enjoy listening to it by the time episode 11 came rolling around. 
Characters (10/10) Outstanding  
*Spoilers*
We understand what One Punch Man is about just by the name alone and some people don't like the fact that the main character and majority of the story revolves around such an aspect. But when you look at the story for the other characters like Genos and the his quest to become strong (same thing goes for Mumem Licenseless Rider) I can't help but give props to creation of these outstanding character doing their very best to become the best hero they can possibly be. The search Saitama has to go through to obtain a fight that would last more than one punch had been found by the end of this part of the adaption of this series and that is with the final fight, but even at the end Lord Boros could tell that Saitama was still holding back so one can say that this entire fight COULD have ended in One Punch if Saitama wanted to so just because Saitama didn't defeat him in One Punch doesn't be he couldn't have because if the so called ""Serious Punch"" that ends Boros ended Boros and it wasn't Saitama's full power (both Saitama and Boros knows and confirms this) that Saitama COULD have finished the fight in One Punch if he wanted to the start, which still makes Saitama ""One Punch Man"" just because he didn't feel like ending it in One Punch doesn't mean you should rip the title away from him obviously the creator had to make the final fight entertaining which is why the ended up this way. BUT I DIGRESS. Back to the character of Saitama, he's a joke character yes but is quest to find someone that can give him the fight of his life continues and the day we will see with we may never know but you can't say it isn't unique because I don't know a character from any other series that has to go through what Saitama is going through it's a different type of struggle on a completely different spectrum. Other characters like Silver Fang, Atomic Samurai, Metal Bat, Tatsumaki etc. are all interesting characters also so even if you think the main character is dull, I would be surprised if you they are also. 
Enjoyment (10/10) Outstanding 
Like I said this anime did not adapt what I read perfectly. Minuscule things were changed but it didn't hurt my enjoyment enough to not give this section a 10 also for perfect adaptation of the characters and story alone I enjoyed this just as much as I expected it lived up to my hype and since there was no music while I was reading it hearing such amazing music during the crazy hype fighting scenes is another reason why my enjoyment isn't anything lower than a 10 itself that's something only an anime can give you (that's of course if you aren't listening to music while you are reading manga which I wasn't during that time). I was hyped and ready every week and it delivered damn near every single time it made my sundays worth living.   
Overall (10/10) Masterpiece
It's definitely my #1 choice, I hope that this gets a season 2, because we know MadHouse is famous for not doing second seasons for majority of their anime. This one needs to happen the world would be a better place with anime season of One Punch Man in it. Yusuke Murata the artist for the manga publication of this series even stated that he'll will try to make a season 2 happen so hopefully (NOT ANYTIME SOON BECAUSE I KNOW THE MANGA ISN'T THAT FAR AHEAD OF WHERE THIS ANIME CONCLUDED) we get a season 2.",10,Rikuson1

                First of all, there is no way OPM is a perfect 10 or a ""masterpiece"". Everything OPM does, a certain other anime with over 300 episodes does better and does it for a very very long time without getting boring. 
The JOKE here in OPM is one of those jokes where it leaves you amazed for a long time but it cannot be repeated. You make that joke and you finish it there. It is extremely funny and everybody likes it crazy but yuo can't keep repeating it. The magic of that joke has a cooldown. Once in a blue moon we get Tatsuya, Alucard,
                  Raizel but that's all. You remember that generic shounen MC gif, yeah that's what I am talking about. The craving for OP heroes is real. THE ULTIMATE STRONGEST HERO, we were waiting for that. However what happens once we get it? It doesn't get better than that so it starts to fade after a time. No matter how good the joke is, you can't keep telling it and that's the problem with OPM. Now do I want Saitama to be beaten? Absolutely not because that would defeat the whole purpose so that's also not an option. Then why the hell did I gave a 9 to that show.
1- Saitama is OP and no matter how repetitive it is, I would rather have a repetitively OP hero instead of a repetitively lame hero we see in 99% of shounen genre.
2- Side characters. In this case we are only interested in Genos. The way he is designed actually shows that even the creators of this show was aware of the repetition so they added Genos, the hero we know so well from any other shounen. He is the exact opposite of Saitama and having both of them actually does a damn good job at showing the contrast between the two. 
Genos is flashy as fck, from his hair color, hair design, eyes, his body to his combat style  and even his mentality. It screams the word flashy. Saitama on the other hand is made to be the most simple character. Genos lives that Ichigo syndrome being a generic shounen hero he is, and he gets stronger overtime and every battle he fights is always on even grounds, back and forth epic combats. Saitama on contrary is ONE PUNCH. Genos have that tragic past like every shounen hero while Saitama is just a dude who become a hero as a hobby. They fill the void Saitama leaves behind with Genos. Genos provides standart drama and eyecandy to the show and Saitama provides the epic feeling you rarely get. And please note that, epic things are epic because other things are ordinary. If all we saw was epic, it would get boring and thus NOT EPIC.  And that's why I gave it a 9. They somewhat keep the magic alive and doesn't overuse the EPIC feeling. Also anytime a character realizes Saitama's strength, I am watching for that reaction. So there is tons of material too.",9,sk8erbyern
30276,"
                I gave this show an 8, not more, not less.
Why can’t I give it less than 8? Well, One Punch Man (OPM) presents to us one of the most sublime animation and fighting scenes in recent history. When it comes to action, OPM never fails to disappoint. The OSTs, especially the ones used during battles, are also very awesome-sounding, definitely gets your adrenaline pumping when they are needed most. In terms of presentation, OPM truly delivers, hence giving it less than 8 really does seem to be a sin, as it is definitely better than your usual run-of-the-mill shows. 
Then, is it enough to go
                  beyond that? To the scores of 9s or 10s? To me, nope. Beneath the eye-candy and eargasms, there is nothing much that the story of OPM can offer. Due to the sheer overpowered-ness of Saitama, everyone else in the show is essentially reduced to a joke. Yes, the heroes Tatsumaki, Silverfang, Genos etc are strong characters to their merit, while the antagonists Deep Sea King and Boros are indeed very formidable opponents. But in front of Saitama, everything turns to comedy.
I get that Saitama being so powerful is all part of the charm, but ultimately this makes the show shallow and fights will often end in an anticlimactic way, simply because all it needed was one punch from Saitama. As a result, the plot simply revolves in a dull manner: bad guy threatens peace, Saitama finishes him off, rinse and repeat. There is hardly any suspense or anticipation, as we all know how it is going to end.
So, is OPM enjoyable? For mindless fun and superb fighting scenes, yes it is. Comedy-wise it is decent too. But is it a masterpiece? Hardly. But the show doesn’t end here, so hopefully in the future it has a lot more to offer.",8,Lord_Odous

                What does it take to become the strongest? More importantly, what does it mean to be a hero?
Some would say through talent, others would say through strict training and determination; sheer force of will and aspiration to be the best. A certain someone has definitely achieved such power, but he's facing a very striking dilemma: He has become too strong.
One Punch Man is an action/comedy that does not hold back in either fronts. Not only that, but the world is filled to the brim with hilariously creative and absurd characters, each with their own charm and personalities that relentlessly poke fun at Shōnen character tropes.
                  The anime's titular character, Saitama, has achieved such awesome strength that he finds no challenge in any adversary he faces, thus finding life itself dull and disengaging. This personality coupled with his godlike strength produces comedic effect that, in certain situations and encounters, leaves me holding my sides in laughter.
The animation of this adaptation is most impressive. Not a single wasted or useless frame is used and each shot conveys the feel of the situation. No shortcuts, no cheap CGI. You can really tell the animators were passionate about animating this thing, and I think it's a beautiful display of artistic talent and choreographic direction. It takes a keen eye to notice the little things the animators did, and it's those little things that makes the animation especially memorable.
The color palette is bright and engaging. There is never a moment where there is a misuse of colors and I especially appreciate the direction in coloring the characters as they are absolutely a treat to look at.
The sound and music are exciting and really accentuate every situation. I also appreciate the absolutely amazing opening track. It really sets the awesome and over-the-top nature of the show.
As I stated above, each character has their unique charm. Even those who only make their appearance in a single episode to serve as Saitama's subject of immensely powerful punches (and slaps), they still leave behind a charming memory that a lot of people will come to appreciate.
An important aspect of the anime is indeed its comedy, and it does not fail to provide laughs with smart jokes and hidden puns. Some people are off-put by its deceptively simple premise: A guy who is unfathomably strong is a carrier of a laid-back personality and continuously 1-hit KO's seemingly powerful opponents. What needs to be further understood is that this premise is merely a baseline. In no way is it the ""gag"" of the show that repeats itself, it is merely a characteristic of the main character. The comedic elements come into play when certain situations arise. Some are subtle and some are abrupt, and Saitama's duality serves the function as the lighting rod for these elements, turning into hilarious outcomes.
I enjoy this anime very much. I am an avid fan of the anime and the webcomic, and I am very pleased with the adaptation. I can only wait to see the look on everyone's face when the Garou Arc is adapted. Only then will people truly understand what it means to be a hero.",10,boaraes

                What can I say about the Phenomenon that is One Punch Man which hasn't been said before. I am referring to it as a phenomenon because it really is. One of the evidence to that, is that in IMDB it surpasses shows as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones in of the charts ... It literally took the world by storm with its unique brand of humor and lovable characters.
Story
The story is very simple, our main character's name is Saitama and he is the STRONGEST MAN ALIVE, there can be no other opinion about it. And we see how he struggles to get excited for
                  a battle and go all out since, he ends everything with one punch, and that's why most of the time he is bored. At some point in his life he wished to become a hero, and now that he is one he looks like he lost all his joy. But the thing is that he is drawn so plain, that no one can believe that he is the strongest hero in existence, and he always gets looked down upon, but it does not bother him in the least, even when people see he beats monsters left and right no one believes he really does it because he is strong. There is a Hero association where there are ranks and the funny thing is that even though he can be in the strongest S class he is a C class hero ... The truth is that this anime shows that everyone can be a hero, doesn't depend on what you look like or what you can do. What's important is to never give up.
Art
The art is BREATHTAKING, Madhouse studio at its finest. And when I learned that they are doing this anime with an average budget even though it looks like it has unlimited budget, but the people that are making it are dedicated because they love this story it's a completely different feeling. When you see how the battles are drawn and how fluid the animation is, the color pallets and how there is absolutely no CGI, or even if there is it's so good that you can barely guess it's CGI can really change your perspective on how animation should be handled.
Sound
One of the other things that make this anime one of the best is the soundtrack. MY GOD, this OST is beyond words. The music is so good that it literally transports you into this anime and the battles. Don't even make me start about the Opening song from Jam Project. Probably the best OP song ever. It gets you hyped as hell before the anime starts, and that's really important in a great anime. Also the Seiyuus are one of the best. In every episode there were some of the best seiyuus of our time, be it for a small role or main role they really raised the bar of the overall quality.
Character
I can't really say that there is a lot of character development, but most of the characters get their time to shine, and we see their resolve as to why they decided to be heroes or villains. Our MC Saitama shows what a hero shoud really be. He saves people, but he doesn't care about popularity or how they look at him, as a matter of fact he never takes the credit for what he does, because for him being a hero is a hobby at first, but after that it becomes his job that he loves, but not to a point where he would change himself as to make the people happy. We also see here that even if you save people they will not be as grateful as you think, but he doesn't care about that at all. 
Enjoyment and Overall
Every episode of this anime was one of a kind for me. One of the highlights of my week. It was so good, that you just don't sense how the time flies. Every episode for me ended in a flash. Incredible execution of an incredible manga. And YES the hype was worth it, because it withstood the hype and even surpassed it. That's how good this anime is. It was worth it to wait for months to get this greatness. A 10/10 for me.",10,Valkata

                Lately this show is has been labelled as the ""SAO of 2015"" or ""One joke man"" and I can understand where they're coming from. The popularity has made One Punch Man 10th pl-... oh that's wrong it's now 11th place in the rankings at around 9.05. Oh wait no it's now 9.04, proving that people are just downvoting it because it's popular. And that is the real problem, the show is so popular that people are now voting in droves to drive it's score down, which is probably less sinister than I make it to be in truth. However I don't see how a popular
                  show to a large amount of people can suddenly make people hate it, I mean with SAO as an example. It's a good show up to episode 14, but then it's just generic, but the fact it was popular made some people just hate it with a vengeance. And it's sort of obvious, to see people give this show a 1, but than give the latest cut and paste rom com a 9 with a straight face. And this does come off insulting or mean I know, but I fail to see how popularity makes a show bad in any way, sure this show has it's faults and I'll get to that in the actual review and I don't think it's perfect but it's far from bad.
Story: Now at first you wouldn't be mistaken if you thought this show is just fill of gags and jokes all through it, which true probably until later on. At that point the comedy does still have a presence, and the later eps might show that as at the time of writing only 9 eps are out. But later on at this mid point, the show takes the idea of the portrayal of people in the media, and challenges that idea through the main character Saitama who just wants to be a hero ""for the fun of it"". Now he may say that, but you certainly get the idea that he's actually doing it because he wants to be a decent hero, even if the public don't give him a good reputation. And that's the thing, he's willing to throw his reputation away for the sake of letting heroes that risked their lives get the credit that they deserved. The supporting character Genos, who hadn't actually done anything, it was because he was the top class (class S) that the media portrays him as a glorified hero, who at that point had not done anything at all. This doesn't completely sum it up, but the story really does a sort of 180 and goes from gags and jokes to a more serious, real life meaning, which I know sounds more serious than I'm making it to be, but it is.
Art: The art is pretty amazing, and the animators definitely had the budget in the fight scenes. You could compare this to Trigger's Kill La Kill series, however that particular show did suffer from at brief points, terrible SGI but it in no way stops that overall quality. You can really get the cartoony feel, and the fight scenes when they come down to it look amazing, even though the fights with Saitama last around 10 seconds. But you can tell that the characters really had alot of effort put into animating them which is commendable. When you have a show like Aldnoah Zero as an example, that literally pulls SGI mechs everywhere (with the exception of one scene, with a mech that was only on screen for about 15-20 seconds) it shows that the animation team did not cut corners at all.
Sound: The sound track is pretty entertaining, Genos' theme is good to listen to, least not forget the rest of the soundtrack. But overall the soundtrack is solid, with the OP being pretty fun to listen to. It may take some warming up to, but then you begin to enjoy the whole ""hell yeah Saitama's gonna save the day"" sort've feel.
Characters: The characters vary pretty well, it thank fully doesn't have any crybaby weak characters that you'd expect just to fill the hole, which is good for a show that centers itself on strong heroes. Saitama is probably pretty deceiving at first, and may give off the impression that he's a blank slate that is only there to launch the jokes at you. However later on he states that he only cares about saving people, and frankly doesn't care that they think illy of him, even at some point intentionally looking like a total fraud so other heroes may get some recognition. And because of this early deception, some reviews that I've read have stated that Saitama is literally only there for the gags and jokes, which early on is true but it shows later on that this is not the case. Genos' the cyborg hero as he's known, is S Class (top rank) which means that although he may not have done much, he's still glorified as a saviour because of his rank. Once again this is the media portrayal, the idea that because you rank highly in society gives you a better look in society and in the public's eyes. Mumen Rider is probably what Saitama was, and sort've still is, with the obvious power difference notable thing to distinguish between them. They both have the goal of protecting people no matter the cost, only problem is Mumen Rider is substantially weaker than Saitama, which allows him to be beaten by tougher foes. But it shows that even though there is an obvious power difference, he's still no matter what risking his life for defending people.
Enjoyment: If you're a fan of comedy, and you get an understanding of what this show is about (from the up to date reviews) then you'll probably have a good time here, the show doesn't have any of those stupid characters or idiotic plot that you'd expect from a show that's as hyped as Sword Art Online. And the whole idea of portrayal from the media is a pretty good theme that the show sneaks in halfway through.
Overall: Well if you've read this far, and the other reviews that touch on the themes and other iconic things this show has. Then you'll probably enjoy the show, it's by no means a super serious show, but it certainly does make you think through all those one punch gimmicks. It shows the difference between Heroes who only care about making themselves stronger, or people who actually care about saving lives. And the heroes that use these two ideas vary in strength, which means you may have a super strong hero that the media idolize but doesn't care about saving people. And a weak person who genuinely cares about saving people even though they may not be as strong as everybody else.

                Everyone gather around! I'm currently selling tomatoes that you may throw at me for rating One Punch Man anything below a seven! With this foolproof plan... I shall become rich!
SPOILER REVIEW!
It's all been said before, the show has great visuals and exciting action, but offers you thin characters and a singular joke that quickly becomes repetitive with every new villain that Saitama, our protagonist, defeats. That's why I would rather analyze something that hasn't been discussed as much in relation to this show, which would be the use of themes.
If you were to ask me, good use of themes is what separates a regular good
                  show and an amazing one. If we were to take the Godfather as an example, it is a movie about a number of mafia-members, bad and immoral people. However, what makes us side with the main characters is the fact that they have a code, one that emphasizes loyalty and respecting family. These kind of core messages are at the heart of any story, and they are what themes are made of. This is why episode 3 and 9 of OPM are the best in the series, and also why I believe OPM has the potential to be a much greater show than it currently is.
I would argue that episode 3 has the most well-written story, in which our heroes confront a mad scientist that's creating evolved human beings. It succeeds at having a balance between flashy action-scenes, and moments of character-driven comedy that also manages to depict a strong message. Throughout the episode we learn that the villain was mocked for his ideas in the past, and that his passion is to elevate boring humans to an evolved state. His dream of course comes crashing down when Saitama destroys his strongest creation with one punch. Couple this with a previous scene, where Saitama reveals that the secret behind his power is that he just exercises regularly, and you can see a message take shape. The one thing the show's villains, even other heroes, have in common is that they don't believe regular human beings have the power to accomplish anything on their own. Saitama's unassuming and silly character stands in contrast to this, being the one that believes people have the power to do anything as long as they devote themselves to it. 
Episode 9 shows the other side of the spectrum by giving Mumen Rider, a weak hero with no superpowers, a scene that shines brilliantly. Despite knowing that he can't win against the overwhelming threat he faces, Mumen Rider fully devotes himself to being a hero and stands up regardless of the odds, and the civilians he wishes to protect believe in him. When Saitama comes to save the day, a rare moment comes where he looks at Mumen Rider with some fondness, as opposed to the indifference and irritation he feels to everything else.
Two genius moments is not enough to make a show great, but it does prove that there is a heart hidden underneath all the pretty colors, power rankings, and silly jokes. If the author was to sharpen his writing and become aware of how he could utilize themes, OPM could be more than just brainless action. It could be a story about resisting the temptation to take shortcuts, and finding the courage to believe in our own strength.",6,Markezzo

                   So one punch man... It's become a pretty big deal here on MAL, already in the top 10(as of me writing this). The anime's story focuses on a ""hero for fun"" Saitiama, the ultimate parody of shonen main characters. And it was quite the shonen parody, it used shonen clichés and saturated them so much that it's comical. 
   The characters were pretty good to say the least, Saitiama struggles with finding an actual challenge, Genos his ""disciple"" wasn't as amazing as people think he is, I fail to understand why people like him so much, don't get me wrong
                  he is a good character, but I'm not sure if he deserves all this praise. The music was awesome, especially the opening theme. I felt like I was listening to a Japanese equivalent to a Queen song. The animation was pretty solid, it used a nice blend of different colors. Finally the story, honestly the weakest part of the anime. Even for a shonen parody it should at least have some explaination for the events, but no it happens like ""GOOD JOB DEFEATING THE SEA MONSTER, OH LOOK ALIENS ARE COMING!""
So the verdict is that One punch man is very enjoyable. It does a good job making fun of the shonen genre and is definitely something you should have on your list.",7,WillTheRaven

                Every year there's always that one show that everyone talks about and praises to no end. You know, series like  Tokyo Ghoul, Attack on Titan, and Sword Art Online. One Punch Man is 2015's hit seasonal, and I have to say that based on the 12 episodes that are currently out (i've heard talk of a second season, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it) it honestly doesn't deserve all the praise that it's received 
OPM's characters are pretty bland. Most of them have one or two character traits that are really exaggerated. This might sound like an inherent flaw, but i'll
                  give OPM the benefit of the doubt. This show is supposed to be an action/comedy, and neither of those genres really require super detailed characters. That being said, There were only a few characters that I thought were likable, namely Saitama and Mumen Rider. A majority of the characters were really bland and didn't have anything to them besides a cool design or ability. 
Now as I said earlier, One Punch Man is SUPPOSED to be an Action/comedy. However, it really exists in this weird limbo between being a satire of shounen anime and just being another generic shounen. The comedy doesn't work because the show takes itself way too seriously, but at the same time Saitama's ability to kill basically anything in one hit keeps One Punch Man from working as a shounen. There's no real tension in fights. Saitama always wins in the exact same way. As far as comedy goes, there are basically two types of jokes in One Punch man: Saitama behaving apathetically toward common shounen tropes, and Saitama killing seemingly overpowered enemies with one attack. This show is about six hours long. As you'd imagine, these jokes get old pretty quickly. As you'd expect from madhouse, the action sequences are really well animated, but as you'd expect from a show about a guy who can kill anything with one punch, the most impressive scenes are usually the ones where the main character is absent. 
to sum things up:
PROS:
-High production value
-Action scenes are well animated
-Some earlier episodes are kinda funny
CONS:
-Jokes are repetitive and usually executed poorly
-Characters are bland
-Tone is inconsistant/doesn't fit the show's premise
-""One Punch"" gimmick is thrown out in the last episode
Overall, all One Punch Man has to offer is a couple of decent jokes and some well-animated action scenes. I'd give it somewhere from a 5.5 to a 6 out of 10. I wouldn't say that it's a terrible show, but lets face it. If any studio besides madhouse had produced this series, it'd be the literal definition of average.",6,domecity

                This anime has the worst ending theme in history. It comes when you least expect it to ruin all the fun you were having while watching the baldy kill stuff. Kind of gory; Kind of fun; Definitely entertaining. It's somewhat like noragami. The hero seems like a stupid relaxed guy that has nothing to him other than his strength, but when you pay attention a bit more, you see that he is quite troubled and cares a lot about others. The beginning is a bit choppy, but it gets good fast. Many make the mistake of it being about fighting, it isn't. One punch man
                  is about the true meaning of being a hero, no matter how strong you are.",10,BlackIIStar

                If there is an anime that is literally of about hype, this is it. And you ask yourself, how can one enjoy something that is solved instantly through just one action. How does one keep it interesting, and maintain the hype factor. (The video review is up on my channel, here is the written)
Story - 8
One Punch Man is the story about a hero just for fun’s journey to becoming the strongest hero in the world. The big problem is, he already is pretty much the strongest hero, although it is not official, because it’s not on paper. The main hero Saitama has trained himself
                  so hard, that he has surpass all expectations and has become bored of all the opponents he face, because he simply beats everyone in one punch. 
Now for the first half of this anime, it’s hard to figure out where the story is going, because we learn that Saitama is simply too strong for anyone, how does the story keep us interested. But although it’s not really the blatantly obvious, the story is about looking for a worthy opponent for Saitama, and the story picks up half way, with the introduction of the Hero Ranking system. Because even though Saitama passed the physical test with flying colours, he did terrible on his written test, and was named officially the lowest rank hero on the Heroes Association. So it’s another story about aiming to the top, of the rankings for Saitama, for him to officially be labelled as the strongest hero in the world.
Characters - 7
Saitama is the main hero we follow in the story. This is a different take for many anime, because instead of a following someone who wants to become strong, we follow someone who is already the strongest in the world. As the story progress, we learn of Saitama’s we learn that Saitama, is actually just not a simpleton, and we learn he has a good sense of justice. Albeit, it’s rather subtle. There is not a lot of character development, I would say for him, or almost any of the other characters. But we do sympathise for him, because he has already worked so hard, and he doesn’t get the recognition he deserves. And I think that what makes him a really likeable character and relatable at the same time, because I am sure many of us have done something, we are proud of, but it doesn’t recognized. He wants to earn his recognition, even if he takes the blame for all the negatives, he carries on non-chant, but is still aware of everything. 
If Saitama is the character who’s already, the strongest, who should we actually follow and cheer for to become stronger, like most other anime. Genos fills that role, at first Genos seems to be a very serious character, however he kind of provides the comic relief, because he is so serious and Saitama isn’t. But you could say he is a probably more a true protagonist as he actually wants to get stronger, and hence he follows Saitama around hoping to learn more about his master and how to become a hero. He probably does get the most character development, as he learns more about Saitama, he starts seeing Saitama actually doesn’t deserve criticisms he gets and chooses to support him throughout the show.
For the other characters, we don’t get a lot of time with them. Especially the villains, because none of them have really elaborate backstories to make us care about them, and it doesn’t help they are easily defeated by Saitama. Same thing applies to the majority of the other heroes, we see them only briefly, as the majority play the role as throw away. As they are just there to stall time, until Saitama arrives. So there is not really a lot of character development, and not really enough screen time for us to really care for them all that much. They are cool characters, I admit, but I can’t get emotionally attached to any of them.
Animation and Sound - 10, 8
If every enemy is defeated by one punch, how do you make it interesting and epic enough for it to be entertaining? With beautiful epic animation, that comes before the final punch. If there is something amazing about One Punch Man, it’s the animation and especially the action scenes. I can go on about all the character designs, because I think they all look cool and funny in their own way, they all have a very unique design as well, something we don’t get too often. The action scenes are great, you see the fluidity of the animation frames and a lot of details for each frame. The explosions and special effects, they all look good. And I like how they switch Saitama’s serious mode and more casual mode with perfect timing. It’s funny because watching Saitama stall for a while, makes for a really good action scene. But that’s not it, there is some very good action scenes by the other characters when Saitama’s not around, giving us more of a real fight scene. I like how the world around them is not really as colourful, but the characters add a lot of colour and personality with their designs
.
For the soundtrack, for the most part I really enjoyed it, it doesn’t really make me go super wow, but for it does, it’s nice to listen and kind gives you a little bit of hype for most of it. The instrumental bits do really good job of hyping up a scene, and I really like it for that. But it’s opening and ending song which I really love for this anime. The opening is an explosion of hype, the song is really just lifts you up with its heavy metal rock, the animation for it builds up the hype and song’s lyrics as well. And by the end of the episode you get the ending which, I feel like does a really good job of calming you down after that hype. It is a little catchy, but after being bombarded with hype, I think ending song is just a perfect way for calming you down.
Enjoyment - 10
If you haven’t heard of One Punch Man as it was airing during the 2015 Fall season, then I guess you’re one of the lucky people who didn’t had to deal with constant spam on social media, of people saying how this is just the great of all time. Because it’s not greatest of all time, but that is subjective, however it was definitely one of the most enjoyable and hyped anime. Because the whole show is just hype, it builds it up perfectly and feeds that hype perfectly. And it’s such a fun show to watch. The comedy is just funny; it feels like it’s not trying, but it just does such a good job at parodying lot genres which makes it so funny. The characters and action scenes are all fun to watch. But can I just say one thing, I don’t like how people are labelling Saitama’s fight scenes as fight scenes, because it all honesty he’s just dodging or letting the opponent hit him until he feels like throwing the punch, to me that’s not a fight scene, it’s an action scene not a fight, because there is no challenge in there for him, you know he’s just trolling around until he wants to win. That’s my problem with people calling these fight scenes epic, it has amazing animation, but I don’t they should be put in the category of fight scenes. Other than that, I loved this show.
Verdict - 8.5/10
As we draw closer to the final score of the anime, I give the story an 8. Although it is not clearly explained what the story is going to be about at the beginning, it does draw in a story about hype and aiming towards the top. And it’s good how they made the plot and world actually interesting despite things being solved by one punch.
For the animation and sound, I give a 10 and 8. The animation is just an awesome spectacle to look at, the action scenes are awesome to look at and have just beautiful animation. And the transition between the more simple seasons to the more serious scenes really add to how awesome it really all looks. The soundtrack does good job of lifting you up and good listen to, but the opening is just epic and really hypes you up, the ending song is just a great fit as well, really calming you down after each episode.  
For the characters I give it a 7. There a lot of likeable and cool characters to follow. And cheering for Saitama and Genos to reach for the top, is good, but unfortunately there is not a lot of room for character development especially when everything is solved very quickly. We don’t get enough time with other characters to really care about any of them.
For my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 10. The anime built up a lot of hype surrounding it, and it’s definitely worth the hype. From story, to characters, to music, to animation to the previews even, the hype doesn’t really die down. It’s just a really fun anime to watch, that you don’t have to take to seriously as well, which really works with the hype.
So for the overall score of One Punch Man, I give it a 8.5/10. One Punch Man is the epitome of Hype, it’s a hyped show, and it never really lets ups, and it’s a fun watch. I recommended this anime fans of comedy, super heroes and action anines, but honestly it’s one those anyone can watch.",8,EbiNewin

Art - 6: I don't watch anime to see pretty animations, I do it for the feels. So it doesn't bother me I personally rated it low.
Sound - 10: 100% on point and done so well on fighting scenes and the mash up of the music was just magical, Extremely well done.
Character - 7: Characters were pretty bland and predictable but ya know what,They were made that way for a reason...
The only score I 'Personally' care about is ENJOYMENT and that

                I'm a guy that doesn't watch anime that often, first and foremost. Mostly because in the grand scheme of things, there's a lot of schlock you kind of have to wade through, or so I'm told by a few more proficient friends of mine. I don't know, I see a few series every now and then that constitute cutesy boob and butt play or just hours of screaming with a boring protagonist that's biggest defining trait is that his hair is a weird color or he's the nice guy. It's a lot to sit through, and ultimately, I just don't find it worth my time.
                  Luckily, One Punch Man offers a protagonist with no hair, so you can just focus on the type of person he IS instead of the person he looks like. 
That's probably the biggest aspect of One Punch Man that I enjoy so trememdously: it's a show about deceit. Not necessarily in terms of plot, as it's pretty straightforward; you would have to be with a title like One Punch Man. What I mean is that it plays with expectation, and as a matter of fact, that's it's one and only joke. The funny thing is, it works. Never before does having the rug pulled out from underneath you feel so satisfying, that you're loving it when a fight ends anti-climactically, only to see how the world reacts to their trivial problems that seemed important at the time be ultimately mitigated and solved by one punch. It's just such a simple premise that never gets old, but instead only continues to impress the more it goes on, as any really good show should do.
It's parody, but it's excellent parody. It pokes fun at everything that draws away from the content of a shounen anime, and shows how on its own terms it surpasses those animes by simply being anti-climactic. You think that big fight with that fish man matters to Saitama? Cause it doesn't. It may matter to you, Genos. Or you, Mumen Rider. Or you, Puri Puri best character. But not Saitama. Why? Cause he's above threats and concerns. He just wants those deals at the grocery store, which quite frankly, if you had the ability to defeat everyone you ever meet in one punch, wouldn't you?
By the way, that was a sly way of just saying characters names in order to sort of go in depth about how I love characters. You catch that? If not, we'll I can't help you now, I just told you. If you did, shut up, no you didnt, that was clever as fuck. But it's interesting how characters in a parody show have so much more depth and intrigue than the shows that it's making fun of. It handles every single archetype, every mold, every personality so well that you'll never mix anyone up. There's heroic but pathetic weakling, there's a cyborg with a heart and a passion to learn. There's a pouty ESPer that solves everything instantly because she's a goddamned ESPer, so she has every reason to pout, especially if your gazing at those legs that go all the way up. More importantly, there's Saitama, the main character, who throws people off because he's not a guy to just relate to like so many protagonists before him try to do. He's too strong, he's bored, he's straight faced. He's got his mind focused on miniscule things because the big stuff isn't worth looking at, not when he can just take it out in one punch. And that's amazing. I can't tell you how many times I laugh after this bald piece of greatness just utters a sigh of recognition or just a response to an event. Never before has the simple term ""ok"" carried so much weight. In short, Saitama is simply a guy that can't give a fuck, and that's so refreshing after you've been drowning in a sea of misunderstood souls and angry hearts of vengeance. 
In short, One Punch Man is just a sight to behold, not just for what it does but for what it points out. It details what anime SHOULD be doing by pointing out the flaws, and it does so in its own weird, blank faced way. Oh, and it looks beautiful. Perhaps that was neglected to be mentioned. It's beautiful, by the way. The ending may not live up to the amount of hype built into it, so prepare just a tad for a lackluster finish, but the point still remains, it's in line with the rest of the show. Is it the greatest thing ever? Probably not. Is it close? I'd say it's just scratching the bottom of heaven. Just grazing it's little fingers on the bottom of that cloud. All it takes is one punch to break through. In short...yeah, s'pretty good.

                Chalk up my rating to the fact that I really do not like parodies. There's a disconnect between me and that genre; where others would be lying on the floor laughing, I am merely sitting on my chair, bored out of my mind. 
To be fair, One Punch Man is decent, more like a parody of a parody, but I still cannot see at what point this is the saviour of anime like others have claimed. It's light-hearted, doesn't take itself too seriously, and there's no continual plot; each plot ends as the episode does, except, perhaps, with the last couple of episodes.
The characters are
                  not well-rounded; some of them are merely caricatures. Saitama was a bored salaryman whose knowledge about his powers came about on pure happenstance, and thus he uses it to become a hero, but ultimately gets too strong and becomes bored because he takes out his enemies with one punch, a'la the title. 
Genos is a cyborg with a dark past. He's the one that brings the comedic effect to the duo; on a regular basis he ends up becoming a trash heap as his opponents regularly take him out, or he loses all self-preservation and ends up sacrificing himself. 
An assortment of eccentric background characters come in to either ""lend a hand"" by being completely useless, or being equally useless enemies. 
If you're looking for a deep plot and well-rounded characters, you definitely won't find them here.
The art was really well done for a show with a decent budget. You can tell that the animators really love doing their jobs and doing it well, because the fight sequences were exquisite - enough to make you want to watch it a few times over. 
The music is catchy and not going to lie, I was humming the OP more than a few times when I was distracted.
One Punch Man is not an extraordinary anime, but a decent one. 
Don't get me wrong, I can see why a lot of people enjoy this anime, but I didn't see what the fuss was all about. Though I have bought the manga. I enjoyed the series enough to do that at least. I will just be among those who can't picture this anime as the saviour of Japan's entertainment medium.",7,crimson-oath

                Saitama looks retarded. His bald head, non-anime eyes, ridiculous costume and dumb expression further accentuates this impression. Saitama, the guy who plays hero for fun.  I had started this anime hearing and reading things like “it’s a parody” or “it is comedy done right”. To be honest, it wasn’t as hilarious as I had hoped, but it was definitely a fun ride.  Pick this series up if you are looking for a series that brings a few smiles and provides action-packed scenes.
Story:
The story revolves around a wannabe hero who trains so hard until his hair falls out in return for peerless strength. Sounds
                  ridiculous? It definitely is. That’s what makes the show interesting. The episodes can be summarized as the overpowered Saitama finishing off enemies that other heroes cant with ease and boredom. So don’t expect much from the plot. It isn’t what makes the show worthwhile. 
Characters:
The cast of characters, like everything else in the show, is ridiculous. There’s the mc who is basically a lazy, unemployed adult who is granted limitless power. There’s jack-o-lantern panic who gives this creepy, shudder-inducing grin when he fights a worthy opponent and then there’s Genos, the sidekick who takes his job seriously but always loses to Saitama. If rich characters with engaging backgrounds are what you are looking for, this isn’t the right anime. Ridiculous characters who fight and say ridiculous things for the viewer's entertainment are given instead. If you are fine with dumb humor, enjoy.
Animation:
As expected of a 2015 onwards anime, the visuals are pretty darn good. I like how the clear and crisp quality further emphasizes the shine of Saitama's bald head... :) That thing is like a mirror. I think some part of the OP had actually focused on his shiny head...
Sound:
I have absolutely nothing to say about the sound. I simply skipped the OP and ED because I wanted to see what ludicrous gimmick Saitama would attempt in the next episode. 
Enjoyment:
My enjoyment of this show is maxed out. I mean, what’s not to like? You have got a bald jobless guy that obliterates evil with a single punch, other ridiculous characters to complement his lunacy and a setting that keeps placing the mc in retarded situations. As long as you aren’t expecting this anime to be anything other than what it is, a comedy, you probably will enjoy one punch man. Oh yeah, and the fight scenes are amazing! Like ‘the-best-I’ve-ever-seen’ kind of amazing. This is one of the killer appeals of the show to me. I had thoroughly enjoyed the fast-paced and exciting fights, especially those fought by Genos. Wow, just wow. If anyone knows of anime with fight scenes like that, recommend it to me. These are the best.
Overall:
One-punch man is no masterpiece, I don’t think it was ever meant to be one. It doesn’t provide a series that creates a connection to the viewer and tugs at his/her heartstrings masterfully. But it was never supposed to. It was supposed to bring smiles to the viewer's faces as they were entertained by this jester’s tale of heroism and power. So if you find yourself with some spare time on your hands, might as well indulge this bald jester in his whims and fancies as he gives you a tour into the mundane lunacy he calls his home.",8,RyoKei-san

                This'll be short.  One Punch Man is like a tiny-action-packed-slice-of-life-Gintiama branch.  Aka, it makes fun of anime, the industry, and most of all.. You and me.
It delivers exactly what it says it will.  It isn't a tragedy for all us Berserk fans (Like myself), or  a slice of life/romance like all us Kids on the Slope romantics (like myself), or chill for us Mushishi lovers (like myself..). or a thrillers for all us Monster lovers (like myself...).  It does exactly what it says it will.. To be a fun, action packed, self expression of just how boring being completely badass
                  would actually be.
If you're new to Anime, look to classics like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, or FullMetal Alchemist.  You won't get why One Punch Man is so downright hilarious and awesome until you've watched (or attempted to watch.. like myself) ""The Big 3"" (Naruto/Bleach/OnePiece....Maybe a tad bit of DBZ in there, but thats more Classic and less failure in a cup).   
One Punch Man is a short expression of the woe's of the Anime industry, and how sometimes we can have an over the top glorious fight fest without it taking a full season to do so.
It is a joy and breath of fresh air to watch for any veteran anime watcher, and can certainly be fun for a newcomer.  As long as you aren't expecting MORE  then it states it will deliver.

                Saitama aka One Punch Man, is a hero parody. Heroes are typically kind, solemn, and/or altruistic. Saitama, on the other hand, is brash, immature, and won't hesitate to tell you where to go if you have any complaints or criticisms. Not to mention he claims to be a hero for ""fun."" Any other hero would say, ""This is not a game,"" but I guess when you can fell creatures quadruple the length and width of the tallest building in Japan with one punch, you can afford to be lax. There are moments when Saitama can act like a hero, too-kind, solemn, or altruistic-but those moments
                  are subtle and quick, and in worst cases, get misunderstood by the general masses. The story gradually opens up from the perspective of one person to many others, and begins to unveil the inner workings of the Hero Association, and their everyday mission to keep the world at peace from mutant and extraterrestrial beings. I mostly adore the anime for its well-timed comedy bits and quick wit that usually come in the deadpan voice of Saitama, or the minute changes of expression in Saitama and Genos. The art is great: I like the well-proportioned bodies and detailed facial expressions of the characters. I also like the ending pv that paints an allegory of the extraordinary doing the ordinary. That is to say, despite someone being a celebrity, actor, engineer, or firefighter-people who are constantly under the spotlight, inventing things, or running into the face of danger for the sake of someone else-they are still human, and at the end of the day they will have a lull in activity, where they're buying groceries, watching television, or reading the morning newspaper.",8,awee9044

                Note: Skip to paragraph after upcoming paragraph if you actually wanna read the review. if you just wanna read my initial thoughts, continue reading regularly. 
Okay. I won't start on the ""One Punch Man is the best anime ever and if you don't like it you're a weeb!"" note because its not the best anime ever. I really don't even get why its mainstream. I mean, come on, Saitama is the most boring character ever. Why do people think he is so cool? Because he can defeat any enemy with one punch? Because they think bald people are cool? Because all the females think he
                  is hot? I don't know! i'm just glad this anime hasn't ascended to extremely main-stream level, but anyway, lets get on with the opinion. 
I gave story a seven. ""Why Jakene when it has the best story ever?"" may you ask? Well its because the story makes only 40% sense. The rest doesn't make sense at all. Its kinda like Yo-Kai Watch in which things happen in the anime, but unless there is a part two, they don't start off where the last episode ended. Also, the funny (cough cough not funny) villains that Saitama meets in the show don't have a background other than a few special cases. They just randomly pop up and a few of the stories don't make sense. A whole colony of sea creatures arise from the ocean to take over the world? PLEASE. Deep sea submarines would've spotted them already. This is what i mean. One last point on story, the way he gets his strength is INCREDIBLY STUPID. It doesn't even make sense, like the rest of the story. 
Now i'm not gonna go through all the categories (Story, Art, Sound, Character) so I will just talk about the pros and cons right here. Whats good about the show is that it could be called funny to some people. The jokes are cool (sometimes) and the story is funny (despite how i was criticizing it so much earlier). The opening is also catchy, but after learning the beat and humming it a lot of times I got tired of it. the ending theme, not so much. I don't like how it started of slowly (if you listened to it you'll know what I mean) and I never even paid attention when listening to it. Although it is sad and has a reminiscing touch to it. A pro about this anime is that the Art is incredibly good. Those punches look real.....um.....good? And although I have a problem with randomly appearing monsters at least none of the monsters' designs were the same. The developers did that nicely. A con about this show is that sometimes the episodes made me think, ""I can't wait until this show is over"" instead of,""I want this to last as long as it can!"" I don't know why it made me think this way, but it did.
Okay i'm pretty sure i've said all my points, and you probably have something else to be doing with your life. I certainly do, like to finish watching Wagamama High Spec. See ya.",7,Magister_Jakene

                  is about a Character named Saitama who wanted to be able to one punch anything and though hard work  he accomplish just that and fighting monsters and criminals defeating them in one punch. thats basically the whole story. now the characters I honestly did not care what happen to the characters ever single one of them lacked personality and just not interesting at all. now the good things about this anime and yes it does has some good things the first one is the art and sound I really enjoyed the art and sound no problems. and all fight scenes that did not evolve saitama. I mostly hate this anime i enjoyed the first 6 episodes it was kind of funny that the character could one punch anything and kind of funny when saitama freaked out but it got old really quick after 6 episodes I wanted this anime to end. good thing this was only 12 episodes anymore then that  i would of gave it a 4/10. this anime could of been good if it was only 6 episodes but overall is so fucking overrated and enjoyed very little of it.",4,DJM47

One Punch Man doesn't really have a plot; It just follows the story of Saitama and Genos as they struggle to make
                  it to the grocery store sale in time and find powerful villains. I found the comedy of One Punch Man to get old really quickly. The main joke is, as stated in the title, Saitama can one punch anyone, and that joke gets old really quickly. The first couple times One Punch Man made the one punch joke I laughed, but then after that, it just gets repetitive and stale.
Art: 10/10
One Punch Man is widely acclaimed to have outstanding animation, and I can vouch for that. The animation was very fluid, and the fight scenes were very dynamic. The animation quality also stayed consistent throughout One Punch Man, there never really was a drop in animation quality.
Sound: 9/10
The opening and themes of One Punch Man are definitely fantastic, it just isn't as good as some other animes. Ex: Naruto, Fairy Tail, Samurai Champloo, Death Note.
Character: 3/10
There is virtually no character development in One Punch Man, the protagonist already starts out as the most powerful character in the series after all. Most characters are bland, one-dimensional and only there for comic relief. The only character I genuinely cared for was Genos. I wanted to find out more about his backstory
Enjoyment: 7/10
One Punch Man is a very enjoyable show, I would suggest you casually watch it. The humor isn't for everyone, and One Punch Man isn't supposed to be taken too seriously. However, if there is one thing everyone will love about One Punch Man, it will be the fights. The fights are incredibly enjoyable.
Overall: 6/10
One Punch Man is a good anime, if taken casually, however when you pay more attention to the finer details, you will find that One Punch Man is not as good as it seems.",6,Ansonity

                After watching One Punch Man I'm eager to read the manga, so the anime's done its job in making me a fan of this story. This anime is directly adapted from a manga which is in turn an elaborated adaptation of a, err, uniquely-drawn webcomic by ONE. The hero Saitama is the most overpowered being on his fictional planet, to the extent any foe who stands in his way gets eviscerated by a single punch from his red-gloved fist. He also refers to himself as a 'hero for fun', an apt phrase in this silly universe.
One Punch Man's universe crosses the over-the-top fun of action
                  shonen series with the mundanity of modern society. The heroes include Tank Top Master, Metal Bat, and Atomic Samurai, amongst other distinctly non-threatening sounding characters. Those are characters amongst the elite 'S class' of heroes though. There are genuinely unthreatening heroes among the lower classes, such as Licence-less Rider, the 'cyclist for justice' and top biller in C class. Amongst these, Saitama, a bald young man with a killer training regime, reigns supreme, and bored with the weak villains who can't defeat him.
One of One Punch Man's main themes is the struggle for recognition in a society that often values popularity and ceremony over genuine accomplishment. When Saitama joins the Hero Association, despite breaking every record in the physical tests, he is placed in class C by virtue of a poor essay. When he deals with threats even class S heroes can't handle, he is accused of being a fraud. Appropriately, the way it's treated is entirely tongue-in-cheek. Sadly, by the end of the anime there has been little time for One Punch Man's story to grow into it's own, if it has a destination in mind.
Nonetheless, through its mundanities and straight-forwardness, One Punch Man attains a level of unselfconsciousness that most 'serious' shows cannot muster. The action moves at a pace that matches the author's imagination, thanks to a range of talented animators who realise it. As a result, this anime delivers spectacular action scenes; supremely dynamic, flashy, and with a thrilling sense of impact and scale. Even if the fight's ultimately finished in one punch, Saitama's more than happy to drag it out to make things more exciting.
One Punch Man's universe is unique, and it's main character is, dare I say, iconic. It's a property with the potential for wide-reaching appeal. Though, by its parodic nature it is derivative of a variety of well-established tropes. Whether it has staying power, or is a passing fad, I couldn't guess based on a part-adaptation. The potential is there. One Punch Man has spectacular fights and an abundance of personality. However, its plot thus far is insubstantial and a second cour is desperately needed. I'm not waiting for one though, I've still got many classic anime to watch and there's a manga with excellent art begging me to read it.",7,Gridfire

                Going into this anime I had no expectation of it being great I mean a bald hero that beats all his opponents with a single punch ridiculous right? But it actually surprise with with how funny and how great the characters and the fight scene looked. This anime shines not because of the story but because of the comedy, art, and characters it offers. One punch man is an anime that you can sit back and have lots of fun with.
Story- Is really simple, Saitama just wants to find a worthy opponent because he beats everyone with just a single punch. Nothing spectacular about the
                  story. This is not an amazing story driven anime is about the comedy and the great fight scenes with unique characters. This anime was really funny I didn't expect that because these type of anime is really not my cup of tea but I enjoyed it. I will rewatch this multiple times just for the enjoyment.
Art- Just amazing how great it looks and you can really tell in the fight scenes. 
Sound- Great sound, great music, love the intro music (I don't know that it says but it sounds badass). 
Character- Got some pretty cool characters, a variety of them got some cool fighting abilities and I really like Genos. Great chemistry between Saitama and Genos, You can tell that genos respect his master and Saitama do as well.
Enjoyment- Very fun anime that is a joy to watch. Had lots of laugh watching this and I will watch it over and over again to relive the journey I had with One Punch Man. This anime has my stamp of aproval and I recommend this anime to all anime fans.",8,ReaperxPR

                'One Punch Man' was the it anime of 2015, but I didn't jump on that trend. Only now did I look into it. I was looking for a newer anime with a lot of love. And, man, did I find it.
And I am stunned. It's completely amazing. Why did I watch it sooner?
Likes:
Saitama was smart and understanding. He was humble. Even though he had insane powers, he didn't flaunt it. He called himself a hero just for fun (as in the sub.) He would let others take the glory. And he didn't care about that. He would give them the glory on purpose. And he
                  was so lax. His daily life was hilarious. And not to mention his hilarious reactions to battle. He would say things about his chores or whatnots. And that one scene where he freaks out over missing a sale? Hilarious! I loved it. I smiled and laughed while I watched this anime. Not that I thought I would.
The god modding isn't bad. I could ignore it because of how good he was. That world doesn't deserve Saitama. He was too good for that world.
Genos isn't given enough screentime. He was a completely likable character. Not to mention quite cute... I thought he was adorable when I first saw him. And he was funny too. He took notes on Saitama's teachings (even if Saitama was just making something up.) I loved it when he let himself get hit by acid spit to save a little girl. It was admirable. Honestly, there should be more Genos-es in the world. He was kind and caring and highly intelligent. He didn't flaunt his status as a hero, and he really did try to protect the world. Saitama might be the protagonist, but Genos does deserve more credit. He isn't some cyborg sidekick; he's a hero in his own right.
And then Mumen Rider. Gosh, I didn't care for him at first, then I fell for him. (Not in that way. Stop thinking that way.) He was so caring. He was different than Saitama and Genos. He wasn't that strong; he was a C Class hero. (Even though he was the top C Class hero.) But he jumped into all sorts of situations. He didn't hesitate to risk his life for the citizens of the city. He was admirable. (In a different way than Genos.) I respected him. A lot.
This show was too funny. As I mentioned, Saitama had this sort of humor that made me laugh every time. I couldn't help it. He was oblivious to what was happening around him. His comments before, during, and after battle were unrelated to the situation. A good example is the mosquito swatting scene. He was so strong but couldn't kill a little bug. (Which contradicts what happens in the rest of the episode.) I cracked up each time. The laughs worked well with the darkness of the whole show. They were a good counter to the gore. Kudos to the show's creators.
Dislikes:
If you don't mind 'Attack on Titan' level gore, 'One Punch Man' is for you. When Saitama punches things,  they explode. No seriously. The blood splatters everywhere. The guts spill across the floor. It's dark. Really dark. While I can stomach that, I know some people might not be able to.
Puri Puri Prisoner is stereotyped. Really bad. He's gay (as seen in his obsession with the other male heroes.) He was this sparkly character with 'angel forms'. I couldn't help but gag. How stereotypical can you get? Very, I'm guessing. The gay-ness of PPP, I'm guessing, is because the creators wanted a character for levity. This is how NOT to do it. I cringed every time he was on screen. Sure, he was powerful, but that is negated by the stereotype. And not to forget the fact that he has a boyfriend and avidly chases after other people. Are you implying that gay people are all infidels? (But this could be me taking it too far.) And, one more thing, WHY IS HE NAKED?
The plot is focused on small battles with strong people. Only at the end do you get an overarching plot. I wanted more of a story. The battles were cool; that's true. But I wanted a more well-rounded experience. Create an experience. That's what I wanted. The end's overarching story was much better. It was more interesting, and it really got me excited for the next episode. (Though, I'm not a huge fan of cliffhangers.)",8,wrenflyingaway

                Story: 9
The story in OPM is really something different. The main character, Saitama is a hero who has become too powerful and is able to beat every opponent with a single punch, or in otherwords, is unable to defeat any opponent with any more effort than a single punch. He has become too powerful. And that's the comedy aspect of the series. You always get this big hype and build up of a really strong and overly confident villain. Later on, Saitama will always win with a single punch. No exceptions. That's why this series can be described as a parody/satire. But don't get me
                  wrong. That doesn't mean this show doesn't have amazing fight scenes. With many supporting and side characters this show has to offer, like Genos the cyborg, Saitama's ""disciple"", there are a lot of fighting scenes where there are actually lives at steak. But there is never a sense of a conflict ending in despair. In the end, Saitama will always be there to save the day. The setting in OPM is really unique and a breath of fresh air.
Art: 9
The art of the series is quite solid. Very colorful, a lot of cool character designs and topped of with an awesome, cartoonish animation it's a certified 9. 
Sound: 8
The opening and ending of this show are both quite good, no complaints. The voice actors are also quit nailed. My only complaint about the OSTs isn't the songs themselves. It's the constant reuse of some tracks. There will be episodes where you will hear the same song play in 10 different occasions. Even though the songs are really, and I mean REALLY good, there isn't many of them.
Character: 9
The main characters of this show, Saitama and Genos both have very simple backstories. Saitama wanted to become a hero, so he trained so hard his hair fell off. Genos' family was murdered by a cyborg, and he seeks revenge and justice. Saitama reminds me off Gintama's protagonist, Gintoki. He is lazy, his eyes always look like there's nothing going around inside his head. He might be incredibly OP, but he still has troubles dealing with daily tasks, like killing mosquitoes and shopping. Genos is a typical stone faced sidekick who always knows his goal. He has a great respect for his ""mentor"". He can be quite boring when it comes to dialogue and monologue, (unlike Saitama, his conversations with other people and with himself are usually pretty comical) but his fight scenes and development make up for it. His fight scenes are extremely enjoyable. The supporting characters are all quite solid too. The show focuses a lot on the leading cast mostly, so I don't feel the need to talk about the other characters. 
Enjoyment: 10
This serious is a blast to watch. Amazing fight scenes, outstanding comedy, a lot of cool and colorful characters, awesome enemies and hype. The only episode where i could have dropped this series if a wanted to was episode 1. After that it's really hard not to marathon it. You never get bored.
Overall: 9
With hardly any flaws, and 10/10 enjoyment this series gets a well deserved 9 from me. It might as well be a 10, but for me only perfect anime deserve a 10. This series isn't perfect, but still a must watch and the best anime to come out in recent years.",9,Ghykas

                Okay so this was my very first anime that I watched (besides a bit of Pokemon) and I was so pleased. I plan on rewatching before season two comes out!
But this show was just so funny. The humor is very dry and it is super enjoyable. The story line is fantastic, as the plot flows very smoothly. The characters, I feel like, are the show's biggest strength. Saitama is such a likable hero, and while Genos is one of the only other main characters, all of the minor characters are very well developed. 
Again, this was my first anime so I don't have much to
                  compare it to, but I enjoyed this show from the first episode.",10,dougisaac

                Hi guys, first of all, let me start by saying i initially HATED the idea of one punch man. When I saw the title I was like ""what??? they cant be serious"" and then I looked it up and was even more suprised to see it was really as the title meant. I felt it was just lazy writing. 
After watching a few episodes, OPM is easily one of the most enjoyable shows to come across. Its simple.
Story: If you're looking for a story, there's not much to expect from OPM. However, the world of OPM is quite vast and extends beyond our MC saitama.
                  There are several other elements of the show that makes it interesting such as the heroes association and what motivates people such as our MC to become heroes as well as the trials of being a super hero.
Art: A major plus for OPM, you can tell a lot of effort went into this anime. It is over flashy in the fight scenes though but still cool (IMO anyway)
Sound: The ost is nice. I love the opening theme song. There are a few memorable soundtracks as well and they are all well implemented to suit the mood. Voice acting is good as well.
Characters : The characters in OPM are much and interesting. Many characters are even more interesting than the MC himself and I'm curious to know more about them, and thats a major problem here. The characters dont get enough development and many of them have been introduced quickly. I know 12 episodes might be too small to ask for that, but so far only saitama and his apprentice genos have had some form of back stories like why they chose to be heroes. The villains have no backstory whatsoever (who can blame them, they'll be destroyed soon enough with one punch) except that humans are inferior and they want to destroy our planets blah, blah, blah...
Enjoyment: The major reason why this show is such a huge hit. Its entertaining. They did a good job making a show with such a simple concept very funny. OPM is funny not just bcos of how easily he defeats his enemies, but bcos of how well it is executed. The characters are entertaining to watch and the fight scenes are awesome. 
Overall: OPM isn't a serious anime, and it doesnt intend to be, but if you're looking for something simple and VERY enjoyable, I would definitely recommend it. 
Thank you for reading",8,-Taicho-

                This anime is the most ridiculous thing I've ever watched, and I enjoyed every minute of it. The main idea is very simple, but it's exaggerated to the extreme in the most hilarious way possible.
The anime doesn't have an overarching story (not yet, anyway). It follows the daily life of Saitama, a superhero so strong he could defeat any foe with a single punch. Being so strong, he became bored and he's now waiting for a worthy opponent. Along the way he meets cyborg sidekick Genos, who adores him and strives to be as strong as him. Eventually, they join the hero association together, which
                  is filled with hundreds of superheroes with different abilities and different rankings.
The heroes themselves are very exaggerated characters that are simply there to show how absurd superheroes are nowadays; having stupid names, weird abilities and an insane and unnecessary variety (considering that most of the heroes are weak and useless). However, each and every character, no matter how insignificant they are, has a distinct personality and many of them could still be developed. It was nice to see that every character was given attention, with some characters reappearing for a short period of time in later episodes.
The battles (that occurred quite often) were really good. The action in the series was very interesting and not repetitive like in some other anime. The only problem was with fights involving Saitama. Since he could defeat any opponent with one punch, the fights with him soon became predictable (and his bored expression didn't help making things more exciting).
Despite the occasional predictable fight or annoying character, the show was enjoyable enough for me to be able to overlook those things.
The soundtrack was amazing, with music good for both comedic effect and suspense that sometimes made the scene so much better. For example, once a character paused in the middle of a dramatic speech and the music just paused for a moment with it. This was hilarious, it's amazing how well it fitted the scene. The opening theme, ""THE HERO !! ~Okoreru Kobushi ni Hi wo Tsukero~"" by JAM Project is a song so intense you could lift weights to it. Some of the singers behind this song also sang opening themes for Dragon Ball Z, One Piece and Yu-Gi-Oh.
The voice actors were really good, too. Makoto Furukawa, the voice of Saitama, did an amazing job. Saitama's regular bored voice (that sounds so natural) and his serious voice sound so different you could barely tell it's the same voice actor. The cast is a great mix of senior voice actors (like Mamoru Miyano, Yuuki Kaji, Yuuichi Nakamura, Miyuki Sawashiro, Daisuke Namikawa and many more) and younger voice actors (like Kaito Ishikawa and Ami Naito). All of which are very talented.
The art was amazing at times and very simple in others. Saitama's face barely has any details most of the time, except when he is serious or experiences extreme emotions. The art in most of the non-action scenes is very minimal, but I don't think I've ever seen an anime with action so well executed (Natsume Shingo, the director, is amazing). But it doesn't matter if the animation was detailed or simplistic, it always matched the mood of the scene.
So, is this anime perfect? No. But is it worth watching? It is a must! The ending didn't really feel like the end and it opened a lot of questions, but this anime will probably get a second season anyway (and if not, you could still read the manga or the web comic). This anime is one of the best, probably the best of this season. It definitely deserves the hype and it should not be missed.",9,amystic
30276,"
                One Punch Man should be an anime which is viewed at face value for what it is: pure entertainment. The whole concept of the anime revolves around the notion of over-the-top fights, ridiculously muscular men, and a caped baldy who somehow manages to defeat them all. In one punch. The nature of the title itself is a testament to this statement. The writer of the manga/anime is fully aware that the concept of a hero who can defeat virtually anything in one punch is not a particularly wise character trait for the development of any sort of plot line. Thus the only answer that remains
                  is to forgo the notion of character development in order to allow for the emphasis on the thing that seems to actually matter: the fights. However, beyond this OPM strives to be so much more than the average clusterfest of a visually eye-gasmic time.
Story 7/10 - 
Here's something that a lot of people really complain about. The story of OPM is, by no degree, a unique story. In terms of depth, there is none. In terms of complexity, it's a single-celled organism. In terms of substantial character development, we're at a loss. There's no getting around the fact that OPM is a simple story; it doesn't need to be much more. Some people from both ends of the spectrum will argue that the story should be more or, is in fact, more than what I claim. However it must be acknowledged that the story of OPM is just not designed to evoke thought. There is no real deep underlying message the anime is trying to convey. As a result, trying to argue for a more substantial plot when there doesn't have to be one is simply a waste of time. The plot elements that are present, however, are designed to further the premise of what OPM is trying to portray and does so rather nicely. It's not perfect, but it's the most any one viewer could hope for in a series such as this. 
Art 10/10 - 
Nothing really needs to be said about the art and animation of this anime that hasn't already been stated. The budget of the anime given into the fluidity of the action scenes are monumental and translate the already beautiful manga well. The attention of detail pays homage to the original source material and is most likely one of the most well animated series we have seen in recent years. This being said, it should also be pointed out that the character design of the main character contrasts with the somewhat elaborate designs of every other. This does well to add to the characterization of the MC and also furthers OPM's inherent premise as an anime. 
Sound 8/10 - 
Again, like other facets of the anime, the budget for OPM's sound department are top tier. The voice actors in particular could not have captured their respective characters more accurately and the ambient noises provided during the fight scenes are also excellent. An area of note should be a focus on the character Genos, who is a cyborg with a variety of moving parts. The sound department captures this with due excellence. Beyond all this I felt that the soundtrack for OPM was rather lacking. There was, in my opinion, no one track that truly stood out or would warrant a position on one of my playlists. This is a personal preference however, and could be overlooked. 
Character 8/10 - 
A great deal of the appeal of OPM comes from the characters. Though many of them fall under some overused archetypes, this does not necessarily hamper with the series as a whole. Many of these archetypes are meant to fill a niche within the shounen genre and, as a result, have become common. That being said there isn't much to say about the characters in terms of function. They function as their respective archetypes dictates. The individual personalities of the characters however may lead many to join the bandwagon of mutual love for the series with their playful banter and quirky eccentricities. 
Enjoyment 10/10 - 
I enjoyed it. Give it a shot.",9,brandonvu

                ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!
Yep! One of the most highly anticipated animes this season! And it's about  our Hero Saitama and his journey to become the strongest!
..... Wait what? It isn't? He's already the strongest? Alright.....
This show is a deep and emotionally sophisticated show about the world's strongest hero Saitama who is suffering from an identity Crisis!
....... Wait, no? So it's not like a superman sorta deal? Not even a Goku deal where he was sent there to destroy earth? No? He's human?
""Well then Shit! What is this show about?"" you may be thinking, or you may be thinking ""Man this asshole is terrible
                  at writing reviews!""
Well both of those thoughts are with good reason! One Punch Man is a show about the world's strongest Hero Saitama, he went through 3 years of intense training, so much so that all his hair fell out! And now he's so strong, that no matter who he fights, it always ends in one punch! Now where's the story in such a show? Well it's simple, this show is pretty much taking the piss out of your every day shounen shows, a large sum of the humour in this show comes from the ignorance of other characters, many of which either look down on or underestimate Saitama's power. Now hop on! Welcome to the One Punch Man Hype Train! My name is Cocomapopsified and I'll be your guide! Because you think this is some parody anime? Ohhh it's sooooo much more!
STORY LINE MEADOWS
If you all look out the left side of the train you will see the Story Line Meadows! The vast plains! They're..... kinda boring, but look at those flowers and those animals! They're.... cute but not doing much......
Yep, this is probably the major flaw in this anime, the storyline is kinda predictable. This occurs due to the logical consistency that is the main character. Other animes, you never know if a character stronger than the main character will suddenly show up, but in this, he's already the most powerful, so no matter who he fights, it feels like it's only a matter of time. Saitama's punch for the most part of the show acts as a kind of ""Climax"", like the punchline of a joke (heheh get it? ""Punch""line?). When he throws a punch, it's basically the end, though not to spoil anything, but that's not always the case. 
Saitama fights many strange mysterious beings, creatures from underground, a sexually attractive mosquito, I want to avoid spoilers, but man he fights a lot. These fights by the way, are something beautiful which we will discuss once we pass these meadows!
ART RIVER
Now if you'll look out the windows again you'll find Art River! The beautifully flowing water and it's bright blue colour makes it delightful to step in, or just to watch it flow! One Punch Man's art/animation is exactly that, sometimes they'll deliberately make the art look cheap and blocky as the Young Jump webcomic does, this refers to the original webcomic written and drawn by the famous ONE, if you read ONE's version, it's strangely engaging, mainly because he writes it so well, sure the art style leaves a lot to be desired, but you can just picture the scenes! It's really a good webcomic, but in regards to ART, the young jump webcomic drawn by the famous Yusuke Murata, whose art is absolutely beautiful, and MadHouse has done everything they can to recreate the compelling story of the original webcomic while maintaining the character designs of Murata's adaptation. The fight scenes, ohhhhhh the fight scenes, you can just feel the money they threw around to animate those scenes, most notably the scenes starring Genos the Cyborg. This isn't bad either because, genos actually exists in this series as the polar opposite of Saitama, a highly dramatic, highly emotional and energetic fighter with an ambition which drives him forward, literally the opposite of Saitama, who has now reached his goal and is rarely excited and is quite often disappointment.  I can't even call talking about the fight scenes spoilers because you'll find that every fight in one punch man has been editted and uploaded to youtube about a million times for each fight. You'll see, and as you'd hope, they've saved the best for last. Now everybody pay close attention! We're about to enter Sound Forest!!
SOUND FOREST!!
Now everyone, as we pass through these forests, listen carefully, you'll hear the beautiful sound of the now endangered ""Actually awesome OST"" bird, the songs sung by these birds are said to resonate very well with the forests in which they live! And in these forests, hard rock is very welcome! It's not annoying, as it's not around all the time, only when the awesomeness PEAKS! When making this series I think they were well aware of what makes this series so appealing, and hence they decided to make the music quite fitting, something which is designed to maximise the carnage and intensity throughout the arcs right up to Saitama's PUNCH line..... heheh
The opening, THE HERO!! by the JAM project, whose members all have experience making very nice anime openings, the full list being
Hironobu Kageyama - Dragon Ball Z “CHA-LA HEAD-CHA-LA”
Masaaki Endoh - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s “BELIEVE IN NEXUS”
Hiroshi Kitadani - ONE PIECE “We Are!”
Masami Okui - Revolutionary Girl Utena “Rondo-revolution”
Yoshiki Fukuyama - MACROSS 7　“SEVENTH MOON”
When you have these people performing, you know it's bound to be a roller coaster of a song! This opening is easily the most memorable part of the music, in fact I'm listening to it as I write this review! I don't know how many times I've tried to keep up with the song's intensity when singing then I shut up because I feel like I'm ruining the song for myself. The song, with its over the top bridges and insane chorus, really gets you rearing and excited for the episode, but the opening is so intense and awesome, that you almost forget this is supposed to be a show which makes fun of shounen manga tropes, it in fact, kind of makes those tropes kinda cool again, which is fascinatingly ironic. The ending? Ohhh well, it's nice! Yeah, it's nice, nice and uhh, soothing, kinda relaxing after the intensity of the show, but well, nothing that exceptional. Ohh we've passed through the forest! What's that I see? That's the Character Village!
CHARACTER VILLAGE
Now the locals around here are an interesting bunch, SPOILERS!! We have PLENTY of mysterious beings! Big ones, small ones, small ones which get bigger! Ones from outer space, ones which die in less than a minute, some which look like a studio Trigger reject, all sorts! The ""Heros"", we have some which are piss weak, some which are pretty strong but nothing compared to the main characters, but the really strong heroes don't really make an impression until the last few episodes when you get to meet most of the S class heroes, who are the ones which can get anything done, because everyone else is kinda just fodder, but thanks to distinctive yet not annoying appearances (lookin' at you One Piece!) it's incredibly easy to remember the characters, so you'll have no worries there. A lot of the characters have been inspired by characters in other animes, which makes sense since this whole series is designed to parody the shounen tropes, except for Saitama, who is a parody of ""Anpanman"" a super hero in a child's anime of the same name in Japan who head is a red bean filled bread (Called""An-pan"" in japanese) often takes his villains out with a single ""An-Punch"" Hence why in japanese One Punch Man is ""Wan-Pan-Man"". But because of how well they pull it off, it kinda makes the tropes awesome again, ironically. But apart from Saitama, don't really expect anything substantial in terms of character development or in depth character design, they're all just there as stereotypes after all, they're not really there to pull our heartstrings, and while for other series that may be a draw back, for this series that's quite a plus in my opinion, forced tragedy in these series is just a waste, especially since the entire makers and ONE himself doesn't take it seriously, I kid you not he only made the first chapter to test a new software, he didn't think it'd become this popular!
DID YOU ENJOY YOUR TRIP?!
Because I sure as fuck did! If you're looking for something that will move you to tears, then DON'T WATCH IT! Only watch this if you're up for some absolute balls to the walls fun, this series is not a series designed to pull our heartstrings, and it's not designed to be different and intelligent, though some of the philosophies presented throughout the series are rather interesting, so it's not unintelligent, it's just not the central focus of the series. Now, when I rate a series, I like to rate a series based on the intention behind the series and how well they've achieved it, I like a series which knows what it is, and doesn't pretend to be what it's not. Because of this, I'd like to give this show
10 consecutive normal punches out of 10
Because it's not the perfect anime, but it's the most entertaining anime I've seen in years!",10,cocomapopsified

                Hai ! This will be my first review so that i'll be keeping this short. It is spoiler-free.
When i looked at the reviews of this anime,people were bashing it for having such an OVERPOWERED protagonist and being lack of epic fight scenes.
But the whole plot is that. I dont know why they didnt put 'psychology' in the tags but you're actually watching a stressful life of a overpowered guy who is having no joy whilst fighting with evil.
If you think this Anime has no action or nicely drawn&written fight scenes, you should see Genos bursting his ass while trying to beat his sensei or other
                  rivals. The scenes and moves are literally amazing. 
I shouldnt end this without mentioning the great soundtracks,One Punch Man is actually the only anime i've never skipped the opening.
In conclusion, if you want to see;
* Nicely drawn fight scenes, good animation.
* A comedy style that is spot on ( its best when you watch it with hillarious subtitles,so ask your friends to find the most suiting subs)
* An anime you wont even realize how fast it finished.
* A unique protagonist you have never seen before.
* Pretty good soundtracks that you'll soon find yourself singing it without intention.",9,mireska

                So, a very different idea from. One of the very few character design as well. Before watching, I thought it was going to be a very serious series but I never imagined the protagonist to be like this. I liked this anime because of Saitama. His personality is different from all other protagonist. I have been watching anime for last 4 yeas but I haven't found any anime like this. And also the best boss battle ever I have seen. The line "" I'me a hero just for fun"" is also very funny because who wants to be a hero just for ""fun"". I also
                  think the story was told nicely. They didn't hurried the anime.But, the story was too predictable.
I could easily predict what was going to happen. This is one point i didn't like about anime.The art was also nice. It was fitting with the story.
At the end, the story was outstanding. It was one memorable story. I enjoyed the story very much. The sound was also good. Overall, this was one hell of nice story. A very rare story.",8,SacaSeeds

                I could write an entire article about why I like this show and why I think it's one of the best in its genres, but for future viewers sakes I'm gonna focus on the main draw: It's FUN. 
Like really really fun. Like coming home from school and watching Sailor Moon fun. Like staying up late to watch DBZ on Toonami fun. Like waking up early on Saturday mornings to watch cartoons fun. I haven't had so much fun watching a show since I was a kid. That's why I love it, and if you've ever been one to be entertained by such things you'll
                  love it too. 
Basically, if you're looking for a serious plot, this isn't for you. The anime takes the plot of One punch man more seriously than the manga/webtoon but it's still all about the comedy and action. 
Don't misunderstand, this isn't a throwaway gag story. There is an interesting plot underneath the gags and fights if you care to look. Lots of social commentary going on.  But you can also just treat it as a comedy or action anime if that's what you want. Just give it a shot. It might not blow you away but you'll definitely have fun on the ride. 
Small note: I mostly read manga and I generally prefer manga over anime. I haven't watched a lot of anime, but I've read hundreds of manga and the genres I'm open too is everything except harem, ecchi and hentai.
That being said, after watching this perfect adaptation of one of my favorite manga I'm motivated to give anime more attention from now on.",10,Kezi

                This is a really good and funny anime, but I think it was a bit over hyped by the community.
I really enjoyed the concept of the story, and it made for some really funny moments, specially in the early episodes. The art was the best I have ever seen, Madhouse is god on that. The characters were pretty good as well, at least the 2 mains, Saitama and Genos. the series doesn't show too much of the other characters in this world for us to truly know and understand them.
Even though I find this an awesomely fun show, it was a bit too hyped up
                  by the community. The small chapter arcs were somewhat repetitive and the comedy on the show got also got repetitive after some time.
Overall, it was a great series and I enjoyed it a lot, catching every episode as they came out, but, it has some flaws like every show and it is not the masterpiece that everyone says it is.",8,ayuta

                Welp. I finally watched One-Punch Man. After all the hype and bullshit it made me not particularly interested in being in a rush to see it any time soon.
I accidentally started it after watching the second to last episode of My Hero Academia (another one Im very glad to have checked out!)
and found the first episode interesting. It was a lil different, had some humor...I thought it was pretty decent, was unsure but adjusting to the different take on the typical ""shounen.""
But by the 2nd or 3rd ep, I was completely adjusted and loved it! haha I really, really started enjoying the humor. The whole
                  take on shounen and making it out to kinda be a joke..
By halfway through I was hooked! (its only 12 eps) Lol Saitama is so fucking funny. All these OPM/saitama fanboys really scared me away at first, but I gotta say, I love the dude! haha hes great. Not to where Im gonna get all lame fanboi obsessed like some people did.
But yeah, I was pleasantly surprised. I was scared the action wouldnt be good since its all about one punch KO's, but they proved me wrong. All the different villians and their goofy names...they SURE were badass and creative though. and the power levels and destruction was over the top! lol I loved some of the power ups and attacks from the villians.
Genos was badass and surprisingly I enjoyed his love for saitama, which was surprising for the character. I honestly thought he was a villian whenever I saw him on the posters. Lol.
I wish there was this much creativity in character design for more shonens! I remember thinking the whole time that there were so many characters, and almost each and every one I found bad ass (and comical :P ) and kept thinking about all the MAIN antagonists for some majoy animes and how flawed and LAME their character designs and abilities were compared to this show...and they all were obviously made in a half-mockery/joking way.
And even the last episode or two episodes got intense. Made me really feel that Saitama was a bad ass! like damn.
I was really sad to see it end in only 12 eps. I finished that quick. The last attack in the major fight scene had something to be desired, but that was expected and Im pretty sure part of the joke of the whole genre. Reminds me of an ending of a certain anime that most know, but I wont spoil.
There was a lot of loose ends and strings that they never dealt with in the anime, but overall it was such a refreshing and entertaining watch. it wasnt really meant to be watched for its plot in the first place, so I wasnt surprised when it wasnt a crazy ass plot from the beginning.
 I havent found myself laughing from an anime like this in , possibly forever. and yet I still got goosebumps the last two eps.
Makes me really want to pick up the manga which I plan on doing.
oh, and aside from the wonderful animation, I really enjoyed the background soundtrack during some of the scenes. very progressive and interesting. usually Im not specifically looking for those things, but I noticed it here.
Overall, a funny, entertaining, refreshing watch with bad ass scenes and power levels, interesting character designs, all blended into one. Dont come into it expecting the world, and leave with a laughing , tearful face that it ends so soon.",8,dextronaut

                Story:
Who would have thought that a parody on superhero stories would work out this well. At first I thought how intressting could a series about a guy that destroys everything with one punch be.  Well I guessed again. One episode sold me to watch it one go untill the point where these were made, and I eagerly waited for every new episode to come out each week.
Art:
Super nice usage of dry, humoristic, mad and just plain weird faces on the main and other characters made me laugh so many times. The destruction of the areas and buildings and explosion effects I thought were great,
                  also guts and glory took me by suprise which I didn't expect but actually liked.
Sound:
Man when you hear that intro in the beginning: ONE PUNCCHHHHH rly made my day combining that with nice heavy sounds when hes in battle and then good usage of suitable music effects and sounds on the other parts... rly ..... Excellent!
Character:
Away with those I am the man head characters! This guy might appear to you as a boring character but when you think that first you will see his both sides of the cake. I love the way how he shows intrest in some things, motivating himself and then loses it at a certain moment. Not to speak of which litterly small things pisses him of (a reference which has two meanings if you know what i mean)  while big things like a punch to the head is totally ignored by him. The side characters are okey but didn't rly took my personal liking because they just felt blend to me.
Enjoyment:
I laugh at times when there should be serious parts, I laugh at times there is battle going on, I laugh at the humoristic parts. I think I just made my point. And not too speak of those action scenes one after an other keep me really on the edge of my seat without having time tucking myself in with a blanket. Also there is lot's of sadistic, dry and some sarcastic and even crazy humor. It's a balanced recipe mix of all.
Overall:
Give it a chance, after 1 or 2 episodes your sold i'm sure.",10,DaSilentWatcher

The story isn`t anything special, but it works well for this anime. 
Art: 9
This is one of the best looking anime`s out there. It really is gorgeous. Most anime`s don`t lok to great when it comes to fighting scenes, especially when the characters are moving as fast and are as strong as these characters. But this anime did this so well, making this anime one
                  of the best looking out there.

This anime has quite a few pretty cool characters. The main character in this is perfect for what they`re trying to do. He`s the perfect parody of a usual main character. Plus the villains in this are so awesome. Each one isn`t around for very long but they look so cool and are really badass.

                What does it take to be a hero?  It’s an age old question that’s been asked just about as many times as it’s been answered, by many different people and from many different perspectives.  To some, being a hero means putting the needs of others before the needs of ones self, which can range all the way from the literal sacrifice of one’s life to the offering of ones’ time to help the less fortunate.  To some, being a hero means standing up for what’s right and taking whatever measures are necessary to correct injustice.  To a certain man of a
                  rather ironclad constitution, being a hero is a series of four or five moments where you’re offered the opportunity to do something right, especially when doing so is difficult.  To those who call themselves heroes, it’s considered a passion...  A calling to altruism, an irrefutable compulsion to put the talents or abilities God gave you to good use for the betterment of humanity.
To Saitama, a lesser known hero living on his own in a tiny studio apartment, being a hero is a job...  One that lost it’s luster over time, and one that’s become boring and repetitive as he’s outgrown whatever challenge it might have originally presented him.  He’s not getting paid for his heroism...  I’m honestly not sure where he’s getting the money to live off of...  He does it as a hobby.  See, when he was a few years younger, he was inspired to take relentless efforts to become the strongest hero of all time, and it paid off, but to his detriment.  Gone are the days when he could find excitement and purpose in fighting the forces of evil, and in their place are the days when no villain, big or small, can survive the force of a single punch from this blase bald brawler.  When his exploits gain him the attention of an altruistic cyborg named Genos, who draws him into the official hero registration, will things finally start looking up for Saitama, or will he never find an enemy challenging enough to make him feel alive again?
Studio Madhouse is known primarily for sticking to characters with more or less realistic proportions, with diversifying exaggerations that swing more toward caricatures then what you’d normally consider an anime aesthetic.  That’s not to say that they’ve NEVER put out shows full of color-coded girlies and moe tropes...  They are, like any other production company, a slave to the mangaka on any given project...  But the trend is still very noticeable, as most of their work is more lifelike than cartoony.  One Punch Man, on the other hand, is a jaw-dropping marriage of both aesthetics.  It’s no coincidence that Saitama looks more like a real, average person before his transformation and a balloon with overly simplified facial expressions afterwords...  the separation between realism and surrealism is used very specifically to mark show’s use of both tones, as the story tends to skew between one part slice of life comedy and one part supernatural waking dream.  The juxtaposition can be jarring, because it’s absolutely intended to be.
You may notice, in conjunction with this visual choice, that characters become more and more exaggerated and strange depending on just how deep they are in that separation.  A simple citizen may look completely unremarkable...  In fact, with the sole important exception of a young Peter Griffin looking boy who helped Saitama become a hero in the first place, they all look unremarkable.  As you rise in the ranks of the superhero registry, you may notice a few characters who look like Yugioh cosplayers(Shout-out to anyone who spots the Meiko Tsunami clone), as well as ordinary people in day clothes.  Rising further in the ranks, you’ll notice VERY anime-like designs, particularly with regard to the most powerful hero we meet being a little green-haired loli.  But what’s especially interesting is the design of each and every villain you meet through the series.  They don’t last long, for obvious reasons, but they pretty much all leave an impression on the viewer through their memorable designs and backstories.  There is not one character in the show that feels uninspired in the least.
And speaking of inspiration, what can I say about the animation itself without losing my sense of eloquence?  Screw the eloquence.  The animation in this show is like waking up on a dreary morning to find a bright shiny gift-basket on your table, and inside of it is nothing short of pure effort.  I’ve praised shows in the past for having smooth, flowing animation quality with occasional corners cut for the sake of conserving the budget, but with One Punch Man, those corners are apparently non-existent.  The animation is fast and balls-to-the-wall during action scenes, as it should be, but it never stops, even when it appears to be slowing down to portray more menial actions.  There are moments involving frozen key frames, but they don’t feel like budget cuts...  They’re used primarily for comic effect, with the original web comic aesthetic being used as a sight gag, or they’re otherwise used for the sake of mood, with extensive and beautifully drawn shots of destruction, environmental grit and the occasional corpse.  Superhero battles are fast and intense, the gore and destruction at the end of said battles is graphic and exquisitely detailed, and speaking of detailed, every inch of background must have taken the blood, sweat and tears of the show’s art crew.  Nothing less than maximum effort all around, to the point where I can’t even tell if it had a low or high budget.
Arguably the best thing about this anime...  And that is in no way an attempt to take down the rest of the anime, it’s just a matter of comparison...  is the opening, which has to be the most exciting and adrenaline pumping opening that I’ve seen since Attack on Titan.  The main lyrical content almost seems like it’s song by a full on greek choir, singing about the main character and his exploits, albeit with the passion and force that he likely had when he was just starting out and aiming to be the strongest.  This takes place over a rock and roll beat that features outstanding electric guitar work and a percussion you can easily bang your head to without even realizing it.  The OST itself is a perfect marriage of rock and roll with the more traditional orchestrations that you’d hear with each epic turn of an anime action series, and this is especially evident in the show’s frequently used main theme.  Even so, there’s still room for diversity, as it’s perfectly able to slip into an electronic theme when the Cyborg Genos is the focus.  Surprisingly, the ending theme follows absolutely none of this, turning in a more traditional female pop start tune that begins and ends with shots of Saitama’s apartment, as if to remind us that in the end, this is all just a job for him, and he does have to turn in afterwards.
The English dub is still in it’s infancy at the time of this writing, and so far, it’s kind of hit or miss.  In all fairness, I haven’t seen very much of it...  Nobody really has...  but from what I’ve seen so far, there are some positives and negatives to point out.  To start with the positives, Saitama’s dub voice is pretty damn good.  It’s obviously not going to touch the Japanese performance, but I would go out on a limb and say that it’s about as good as an American interpretation could reasonably be.  Max Mittelman is a relative newcomer, and he’s gotta be doing something right, because out of the few roles he’s played, Doraemon is the only show that doesn’t have him listed as a major character.  He was beyond outstanding in Your Lie in April, the only performance of his that I’ve seen before now, and with Saitama, he brings forth a lack of enthusiasm so deep and cutting that pretty much every time he emotes, you can tell he’s faking interest in whatever’s going on.  
Another positive would be the enemies we’ve seen so far, with several Bang Zoom outsiders showing up for cameos and pouring the darkest parts of their souls into playing some of the most deliciously evil villains they’ve ever had the chance to touch on.  I’m not sure how Viz Media got Chris Cason and Chris Sabat to sign up for this show, but I’m glad they did, because their rough, chain-smoker voices sound like they were tailor made to play maniacal supervillains like a human embodiment of pollution and a giant enemy crab.  A slightly more familiar voice can be heard in Cristina Vee, who plays the villain Mosquito Girl in episode two, an insectoid matriarch who’s thirst for blood gives her voice an almost subversively seductive edge, and Vee fits so well into the role that I almost thought she was Michelle Ruff the first time I heard her.  As for the negatives, we have Zach Aguilar as Genos, and he’s pretty disappointing.  Yeah, the Japanese voice had a flat and robotic tone to it, but it still held more personality than Zach’s performance does, and personality makes all the difference with characters like these.  He sounds almost like me, and I have Asperger’s syndrome, so that should tell you a lot.  I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the dub over the sub, but then again it’s really too early to judge the over-all product, so let’s move on for now.
It should be no secret to anybody at this point that One Punch Man began as a web comic by an artist named ONE, and that it was drawn quite a bit more crudely than your average online comic.  now, obviously there’s no rule stating that crudely drawn web comics can’t be awesome...  Little Monster Girl is a prime example of this...  But the original One Punch Man was so simple in both concept and design that you’d be forgiven for wondering why it took off as well as it did.  In fact, a close look at Saitama says a lot about the shortcuts that went into it...  He was probably bald so the artist wouldn’t have to draw hair as often, his suit was plain and generic so he wouldn’t have to do too much design work, etc.  Even the monsters and other heroes looked more like Hellsing sight gags than proper manga characters.  The concept was the kind of thing a grade school kid could come up with...  I mean, it’s a superhero who destroys everything with One Punch.  Before a person grows enough to develop basic story-telling insights, that’s about as complex as a narrative can get away with being.  So why did it explode the way it did?  Why did it get picked up for a proper manga and crowned the unanimous best anime of 2016 in less than 6 years?
Well, to start, let’s examine the seemingly simplistic concept.  At first glance, it’s extremely difficult for a viewer with any grasp of literary standards to get behind a hero who faces no real challenge or apparent threat.  The term Mary Sue gets thrown around if a character is too OP, with a prime example being Kirito from Sword Art Online.   He is the quintessential Mary Sue; He’s stronger than anyone else he meets on a fair basis, everyone has a high opinion of him, and all the ladies throw their virtual panties at him.  This has drawn a serious backlash against his show, which begs the question;  Is it possible to write an invincible character that people can relate to and get behind?  Does a hero have to have challenges to be compelling?  Can you truly stay interested if you always know what the result of every conflict is going to be?  Speaking as someone who doesn’t watch alien invasion movies anymore because the humans always win, I can say with some certainty that this is an incredibly difficult thing to pull off, so let’s look at two financially successful cases that almost pulled it off.  
Depending on the kind of things you’re into, there are two characters you’ve probably compared Saitama to...  Superman, the OG superhero who eats Goku sandwiches for lunch and Batman burgers for Dinner, and John Cena, the professional wrestling golden boy who’s foiled more pushes than the guard rail at the edge of a subway platform.  They’ve both proven their staying  power, even though they’ve each been the target of criticism about how bland and uninteresting they are.  Personally, I’m not a fan of either, but I do understand their appeal.  Superman, as it’’s been very expertly explained by the Death Battle people, is interesting because even though there’s no suspense in regard to whether or not he’s winning a fight, there’s still intrigue as to whether or not he’s doing the right thing, which is something we’ve all faced at one time or another.  John Cena, another boy scout in his own right, is reviled for burying the careers of countless promising wrestlers just by beating them and bringing their relevance into question, but I just can’t hate a loyal company-minded performer who has a passion for his sport and, according to rumors, will stand in the rain for hours to sign autographs.  I don’t personally like either character...  I don’t love anything Superman’s name has been on, and I’ve never gotten excited during a Cena match unless I was rooting for his opponent...  But I get the appeal.
However, Saitama isn’t really bothered by whether what he’s doing is right or wrong, nor is he some passionate role model.  He doesn’t possess the qualities that make those two characters almost interesting, so what does he have that makes him so compelling?  The short answer is his outlook.  Saitama cannot lose...  He can’t kill anything with less than a punch, and while most heroes would be accepting of this accomplishment, Saitama is bored by it.  He is constantly disappointed by every single powerful looking enemy he comes across, and how no matter what they boast, no matter how many people they killed, no matter how many heroes they defeated before he showed up, he can instantly one-shot them.  Considering how hard he worked to become a hero, and how doing so saved his life from the doldrums and uncertainty of being an unemployed salaryman, he should be happy about this, but he’s not.  What should have been a dream job for him has become the kind of job that most dream jobs eventually turn into...  A boring, mindless slog through the same old routine with the same old results to show for it.  This is appealing to most grown-ups who’ve had to leave their dreams behind and settle for something more practical, but it’s also insidiously relatable to anyone who’s ever found themselves bored by a John Cena program or a Superman video game;  You hate seeing interesting villains dispatched without any real fanfare, and so does Saitama, the person doing it.  For the first time with this kind of story, you want what he wants; A challenge.
But even the best of character studies need the support of a good story, and true to form, One Punch Man has no shortage of enjoyable plot lines and story progression.  In only the second episode, Saitama meets Genos, a heroic cyborg whom he just barely saves from literal self-destruction.  In most hero stories, Genos would be our main character...  He’s idealistic, self-sacrificing, dutiful, and dealing with a mysterious tragedy in his past, and he proclaims himself Saitama’s disciple so that he can become stronger under his new mentor’s tutelage.  Having him so close to the central plot adds a richness of depth that, were Saitama alone, would have been sparse.  We still go through the formula of Saitama wasting villains left and right, but now we get to see him meeting and battling them under constantly fresh and innovative circumstances.  He also drags Saitama into the Hero Registration, which is kind of like a Superhero Tryouts sort of thing, that grades passing hero hopefuls with a grade and rank based on their physical attributes and test scores...  And while this is a bit of a spoiler, Saitama bombs the test portion, leading him to be ranked class C, despite his own disciple ranking in the highest echelon of S class.
Now there’s a lot that happens from there that I can’t really get into, you sort of have to experience it all for yourself, so you’ll have to trust me when I say that Saitama’s story never gets boring, nor does it ever seem to drag on.  Everything builds, everything intensifies, and for someone who’s life is tragically devoid of challenging enemies, Saitama deals with challenge after challenge in terms of his responsibilities, his public reception, and the idea of what his place in the rankings means for the reputation of the Hero’s Association, and a climax that beautifully showcases the duality of his biggest conflict by showing us how the struggle for a worthwhile and satisfying challenge can affect a being of much less pure moral fiber.  The series is unfortunately long, and while that does leave a lot of questions unanswered, an issue that can only be resolved with the inclusion of a second season that has yet to be announced, I’d be hard pressed to say it was my only problem with the series.  There are tons of interesting character designs that make up the S class heroes, but you never see more than half of them outside of a meeting room.  
Also, this is yet another series that portrays gay men as over-the-top drag queens with predatory tendencies towards straight men, and that’s been REALLY getting on my nerves lately.  Tiger and Bunny did something similar with Fire Emblem, and while I guess that guy had at least SOME semblance of awesomeness to his identity to make up for it...  Like, he was the only hero rich enough to afford his own sponsor company, and that ain’t nothing...  But seriously, Puri Puri Prisoner is introduced after he breaks out of prison, where he was serving time for literally sexually assaulting people.  I know the anime medium IN GENERAL isn’t kind to LGBT folk, but that doesn’t make the resulting material any less painful.  This is unfortunately a negative side effect of the show’s absurdist comedy style, which is otherwise impressively fresh and inventive.  Also, there are a handful of recurring side characters that, without having anything to do with the climax, feel kind of wasted in the end, like Saitama’s ninja rival and a much beloved bicycling superhero.  As I said before, a second season could fix all of this...  Minus all the homophobia bullshit...  Until one actually comes out, I can’t really call this show the masterpiece everyone says it is, but that’s not gonna stop me from watching it again a few more times.  
One Punch Man is available from Viz Media, although a stateside physical release has not been announced as of yet.  It can be viewed legally at Daisuki.net and on it’s own website, Onepunchman.me, as well as on Hulu.  The English dub is currently airing on Cartoon Network’s late night Adult Swim programming block, a brilliant acquisition on their part.  Physical media will likely be released after the dub finishes airing, so there’ll likely be no news until then.  The original web comic is still ongoing, although it’s a little difficult to find translated versions online.  The follow-up manga is also ongoing, and actually is available stateside from Shonen Jump Manga, with the first seven volumes currently available and with more forthcoming.
One Punch Man is, quite frankly, a miracle.  It’s one of those anime that shouldn’t by all logic, exist, but it somehow does because all the planets just happened to be aligned at the right time.  The fact that it’s the adaptation of an adaptation is already highly unorthodox, but the fact that it’s turned out to be a series so multi-layered that critics with their brains turned on and casual viewers with their brains turned off can enjoy it on virtually equal footing is what’s so miraculous about it.  I’ve heard some people complain that it has an uneven tone, because it takes itself too seriously to be a parody yet still feels too goofy to be a satire, but I honestly just see it as a strongly written show that’s able to stand on it’s own while examining it’s characters and themes from differing levels of sincerity, possessing the confidence to poke fun of itself without losing steam or breaking pace.  A second season will probably be enough to elevate it to the status that it deserves, but until then, I give One Punch Man a 9/10.",9,Fear_the_Reefer

 Exposition: 10/10
 Conflict: 10/10
 Pacing: 10/10
 Conclusion: 10/10
Art- 10/10 (Marvelously Out stunning!) What can I say...You can make a great anime with gorges animation, surprising graphic, and amazing art visual. The characters design are mainstream, the fight choreography to the animation is brilliant.
Sound- 10/10 (ONE PUUUUUUUUUNCH!) The soundtrack is not perfect (To be honest), there sad music and the battle music it is very epic. The Opening music is the best music out of all.
Characters- 10/10 (Very entertainment and awesome) The cast of characters are very likeable, the villains look cool, and each character's have there own development and screen time, and it not about Saitama. 
Boros is an sympatric villain (in my opinion). Also...I wish I want of pieces of Tatsumaki ass you fell-me. Anywhere my favorite character's is Mumen Rider he's is very inspired, and accurse Genos.
Enjoyment- 10/10 (I may over like it, but it I love it) What I know it mass of popularly, I know it a huge deal, but It unbelievable good.
Overall- 10/10 (It not only my Favorites' anime ever, it also my favorite TV show in 2015) The dub is not yet release, and they will make season 2of this series. Here what I like, it a Action-Comedy genre not a parody, character's development story as a fascinated pacing, conflict is cliché but impressive, and it original animation that adaptation to the manga. If you a New anime that is made 2015, I highly recommended watching One Punch Man if your into Action, Superhero's, Comedy, and Style of Visual animation. Check it out!

                If you don't want to read, then there’s a tl;dr at the end, as well as a tl;dr for every section.
One Punch Man; is a very overrated show. Definitely so. But, even so, it is in no way, “bad”.
Over the plethora of adjectives that can be used to describe OPM(Ridiculous, Overhyped, Stupid, Funny), the adjective that describes it the best is: Enjoyable. If anything, OPM is most definitely a very enjoyable show, but it’s in no way “perfect”, nor is it a “masterpiece” as some rabid fans will gladly proclaim.
Now then, onto the review.
Story:- 6/10
There really isn’t an actual story to OPM, nor is there
                  an overarching story, mainly because OPM purely a satirical view on shounen anime and a decent deconstruction of heroes in general.
But even so, there is a basis. Saitama (A.K.A. Bald God) is a superhero who has gotten so strong that he can defeat/kill every opponent in; you guessed it, one punch. Alright fine, it’s not the most original setting, but hey, it works out very well.
But regardless of the basis, the show executes it very well, and that leads to some great comedy.
Although, the story is definitely without its flaws. The biggest flaw I find in the story is the lack of focus. I know that the anime is meant to be a comedic look at shounen, but even so, I would’ve liked some more focus. Another huge flaw is the repetitiveness of the show. The show starts very slowly with the same basic plot repeating itself multiple times, but even by the end there really wasn’t anything new about the plot. Every episode/arc in the series can be summed up by saying:- “Strong looking enemy, no other hero can defeat it, Saitama shows up, Saitama wrecks the enemy.” This is the basic plot of every single arc/episode of the show.
TL;DR for STORY: The story is not meant to be taken seriously, not at all. But that is no excuse for poor pacing and repetitive plots. It helps that these plots are well made, but repeating the same plot 5 or 6 times causes the story to get boring at times. The beginning of the show is also quite slow. Still, even all these flaws don’t cause the charm of the story to fade away, and the story is definitely enjoyable overall.
Art and Animation:- 9/10
The animation of OPM is done by Madhouse, an animation company considered to be equal to Jesus in the anime industry, and Madhouse definitely delivered with this show.
I’m not going to beat around the bush with this section, the animation of the show is gorgeous, especially the fight scenes. Some of the fight scenes in this show are easily some of the best fights in all of anime, solely because of the amazing animation.
Everything feels extremely fluent and I never took my eyes off the screen, especially during the fights.
The manga has great art, and Madhouse was able to perfectly convert the manga’s art into animation.
TL;DR for ANIMATION: The animation of OPM is top-class, and just adds to my enjoyment of the show. Every single part of the anime was animated extremely well, and the fights are some of the best I’ve ever seen.
Sound:-8/10
The OST of the show is definitely a good soundtrack, but none of the soundtracks stand out more than the others.
What does stand out though is the opening. It’s a high octane opening with some great animation and it captures the essence of OPM perfectly. The ending on the other hand is a very calming piece of music with contrasts the feel of the show very well.
The voice actors of the characters of the show also portray the characters very well, especially Saitama’s VA(Makoto Furukawa).
TL;DR for SOUND: The shows soundtrack is pretty good, but nothing stands out from it. The OP and ED are both very good, especially the OP. The Voice Actors also portray all the characters quite well,
Characters:-5/10
This is quite honestly the worst part of OPM. There is a large roster of characters, and each character is entertaining and most of them have a personality, but beyond that, nothing. None of the characters are developed in the slightest. Considering that this is meant to be a comedic show, I can understand why the characters are given little attention, but its genre doesn’t excuse it for giving absolutely zero attention to the characters. Even the main lead, Saitama, doesn’t have any development through the entire show. The only character who gets even a little development is Genos(and maybe Mumen Rider), and even he is neglected.
TL;DR for CHARACTERS: The show had entertaining characters and each characters had a personality, but none of them are given any time for development. None at all.
Enjoyment:-10/10
No matter how many flaws I point out in this show, there is one fact that I can’t deny. I loved this show, and it provided me an insane amount of enjoyment. That’s its greatest strength. No flaw I point out can change that.
Pros:
+Ridiculously enjoyable
+Very good comedy, if a bit repetitive.
+Amazing animation
+Brilliant Fight Sequences
+A decent setting
+A good soundtrack
Cons:
-Very Repetitive storyline
-A very underdeveloped cast
-Loses track of itself time to time.
TL;DR for Overall:
Overall, the anime as a whole is simply enjoyable, if I had to describe it in one word. The animation is amazing and the soundtrack is pretty good, and the comedy and action are great throughout the show. The opening and ending are really good, and the Voice Actors do their jobs well. The characters and story are what really needed some work, especially the character. If each character was developed just a little more, and the story was fleshed out a little more, then the show would’ve been much better.
As it stands now, it’s a very fun to watch show, but it has its flaws. If you are planning to watch this show, just remember to watch it without thinking too much about it. Just grab some fast food and chow down. Only then will you get the full enjoyment of the show.

                What the in hell did I just watched? Yo everybody, it's me The Self Proclaimed Idiot, with a punch to the groan to the anime watching community. But before we start with this review, let me tell you my prediction before watching this anime. 
""What the hell is a one punch man"", he asked with the same stupid look on his face that he was born with. ""I know it's about a f*cking man finishing everything with one punch"" he stupidly suggested. ""I don't want to watch this shit"", he stupidly said to himself. ""But I am going to give overly hyped anime a chance
                  to surprise me"", he said. The only smart idea he had I freaking day. Well here the review people who are still here.
Story (9): A man meet a giant lobster with underwear……no whitety tighties on. Who also I he got rejected from another job interview. But that don't matter a f*cking lobster with hair white man legs had whitey thighties on, oh yeah he had nipples. Okay if you haven't gone and watched the first episode after that statement and hooked. I sorry but that all you getting out of me. The ending had me a little pissed thou. That why it is a nine.
Art (10): There many reason to give the art a 10. But you only need 1. The basic round head and generic superhero costume. I did not expect that. Well done.
Sound (9): I like the opening and the background music, but what in the holy hell was that ending music. It was way to sad. That is last thing I wanted to be after watching the amazingnest of each episode.
Character (10): Each and every character had the perfect voice that matched their body. So 10 out of 10.
Enjoyment (9): Should had been a ten but damn this 12 episode system anime is sticking with. They could have made one more episode or something. There better be a second season or I am going be even more disappointed.
Overall (9): What? I just told you why it got a nine. So go spend you doing something more productive, like watching this anime for starters. Instead read the review a person calling himself a Self Proclaimed Idiot wrote. You are now on the path of idiothood. Now get the hell off! *kick*",9,Fluffynin

                I fearfully watched this series after a litany of recommendations. If you're a weeb like me (and you are, you're on myanimelist) you've been to anime cons, and there's a certain atmosphere that the extremely popular shows carry with them. The whole headband thing happened before I watched any Naruto, and after watching parts of it I was left with ""Yep, this seems like the kind of thing that a 26 year old man who rides the train wearing an anime gear would like"".
But, not so with One Punch Man. It's genuinely hilarious; a lot of parody is simple imitating something while being deliberately stupid
                  but One Punch Man is able to be an interesting action show while making fun of the format. 
The premise of the show is simple, a Mary Sue so powerful he can kill any enemy with a single punch. The show is able to be surprisingly non-procedural, and the plot noticeably advances every episode. Excessively violent, but tastefully, and somehow humorously. I'm surprised that as a 25 year old person I laughed so much at someone unexpectedly exploding, but there you go. 
As the series goes on, a few noticeable faults appear. Genos, the side kick, is pretty dull. It's unfortunate that the series whose entire premise (and resulting fame) is based on having a fresh take on the hero then uses such an off-the-shelf assistant. The same can be said for the hero's they meet along the way; the ""wise old man"", ""headstrong kid"", and so on. Both of these things result from parody aspect of the show; it's difficult when to draw he line from tasteful mockery to simple bad/lazy storytelling, but to me they crossed the line multiple times. 
As well, there is a second season coming. Frankly, I'd be surprised if the series doesn't turn to garbage; there's a double-edged sword to having a unique premise, it intrinsically makes your show a little bit one dimensional.
But for now, it's probably my favorite comedy anime. Definitely worth a watch.",7,MattMatterson

                One Punch Man has to be one of the most popular animes since Attack On Titan, and quite honestly, I can see why. 
This anime ticks all the right boxes. It's funny, it's engaging, it's action packed and never fails to my keep enjoyment level high. I can't believe that the first season is over already :(
Story: 8.5
If you didn't know already, One Punch is an anime that parodies superheros. It plays on the idea that hard won battles can be won with only 'one punch,' by an ordinary man, AKA egg head AKA Saitama SENSEI. Having completed the series just today, I have to
                  say that there isn't much more than that. It doesn't seem like there is a lot of substance to this show, as it gets rather predictable. We all know how the battle will end.
Spoiler alert: Saitama will ALWAYS win, with only one punch. 
It is an anime that never takes anything too seriously which is part of its humour, and I like this. Even though the entire anime might sometimes seem like one big joke, it really isn't once you put aside the funny stuff. There is more to it than just winning with one punch, and the humour in that. It's about our humanity, and what it means to be human. Deep right? 
For that reason, I am hoping that season 2 will show more of this.
Art: 9
The fight sequences were AMAZING. Hands down, I loved it. The character designs were good too, although perhaps the villains could have been drawn with more care maybe? They ended up all looking rather generic. Maybe again, that was the point. Other than that, I was very impressed by the fluent fight scenes and how they appeared comic-like. Nice stylistic choice.
Sound: 10
Perfect. The OST was absolute perfection. The OP was catchy enough for me to randomly sing it in the shower and the music used throughout the anime set the mood so well every time it was used. It was uplifting at times, intense when it needed be, even sad. It was brilliant. 
Character: 8.5
These characters in One Punch were great. They had substance and were hilarious in their own way. The only characters that lacked this were the many villains to come and go, as of course their main aim in life is to rule the world. Although they all came out the same, but I have no complaints as they are not meant to be fleshed out characters anyway. This again adds to the humour of the show.
That being said, our MCs were brilliant, and never did I find any one of them annoying. Interestingly enough, I am intrigued by the other characters that have not been fully shown throughout the series. Seriously, especially with the last episode done and dusted, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT ENDED THERE. 
Overall: 9
To be honest I can't watch more than 3 episodes of One Punch in a day, as it may seem to get repetitive. But as a comedy anime, One Punch Man has definitely went above and beyond my expectations, and I am so pumped for another season of it. In fact, I am so pumped, Ima go read the manga now.",9,bleumouse

                The ""hype"" for One Punch Man made to me give him an opportunity (anime and manga), something of what I do not repent. How in the majority of the chapters are different histories there is no much that to say, I liked enough all. To the being a series of ""parody"" will contain, obviously, comedy. OPM stands out for his comedy, is good enough. The animation would put it only good how. (So much the design how his characteristics) I liked characters enough, emphasizing between all of them Saitama and Genos. The opening stays to the perfection with the plot of the series though the
                  ending did not seem to me to be so good. The soundtrack in general is good. Conclusion. OPM is one encourage very well, ideally to see in a little time and to laugh during awhile.",9,YukiBook

                To put it very simply, ""ONE PUNCH MAN"" is a show specifically made for anime fans; specifically fans who grew up watching shows like ""Dragon Ball"", ""Gurren Lagann"", ""Gundam"", or any popular action shows.
This series is most enjoyable when you fully understand the character archetypes, the references, and why Saitama is one of the best Anime characters EVER created!
In a way, One Punch Man is the anime version of Deadpool (don't stop reading because I'm about to make a very good point here)
Both One Punch Man and Deadpool do the same thing in their shows; they constantly poke fun at their own genres by indirectly
                  (or in Deadpool's case, DIRECTLY)  parody-ing the established cliches of their genres.
In conclusion, if you ever wanted to see an anime show that was similar to Deadpool: THIS IS THE SHOW YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED!",8,4Tifier

                This was such a hilarious anime to watch. The reason I give it an 8 is because although it was a refreshing anime, it didn't have all the details like the manga did. At a few points there was plot holes and in the in end, it didn't feel finished. It felt like is was rushed. I did like the art, for example I liked when Saitama was in his serious mode, he would look badass. The sound was good as well and I like the comedic characterization. And of course everyone can relate to Saitama, and that's what made the anime for me really.
                  I was disappointed that it didn't have as many episodes as I would have like it to have.  I think that if more episodes were given maybe it would have been a 9 or a 10.",8,HibariRyudo

                                           ""Completely Hilarious and Full of Quality""
One Punch Man is one of the funniest and most entertaining anime series I've ever watched in my entire life.
Even though it is a newly started anime, the first episode was highly anticipated throughout the anime community, and it was definitely golden in my eyes, with high quality animations and a hilarious story line. The main character, his enemies and the life he lives is a complete mockery of other popular anime plots,
                  both from recent and present anime's. The lines and the dialogs in the episodes are full of puns and jokes, with a satiric sense of comedy injected into them. I highly recommend that you watch this anime, as it will definitely at least bring a smile to your face, and you won't regret the time you spent to watch it.",10,NabilAl-Muhammad

                Frankly speaking, this show drops your balls (if you have a pair. If not, compromise) by having more awesomeness per unit time than the entirety of long-running shounen anime *AHEM* Naruto *AHEM*. Now while those anime have a plot to support whatever awesomeness they have, this show supports its awesomeness by, you guessed it, more awesomeness.
Now I had read a bit of the manga (~5 episodes of anime) a while before I got my hands on the anime (IN 1080p THAT TOO) and when I started watching the show, I was immediately surprised by how fast it's going through the pages and just delivering so
                  much material on-screen. And then blown away, again and again and again.
You've already probably heard the whole ""it's a superhero satire that manages to not be boring by being bloody awesome"" and I won't waste our time reinforcing on that. But if you say it's predictable, to you I say, ""OK"". Cause you're clearly missing the point of the show which is to bypass the whole suspense and just allow you to enjoy it. So if you're someone for whom logic or plot or any sense is paramount, I'd either have an open mind or stay away from this show. Just don't bitch about it.
I'll keep it short -
The animation is Godly
The soundtrack is awesome
The characters are vividly different and all kinds of intentional cliches
The plotlines are fucking ridiculous in increasing ridiculousnessity.
and our Hero is super-likeable (at least for me)
If you love Shounen - Watch it for how bloody awesome it is
If you hate Shounen - Watch it to see how much fun and mockery it makes of Shounen.
There are a few episodes that aren't as funny or eventful as the good ones and a couple of opened mysterious plot points that actually don't really bother you much if you don't care about it (like me ) and would rather just bask in the glory of everything that's going on so it's not actually enough for me to hold it against the show and decrease its score too influentially.
The closest comparison I can find to this show would be the movie Kingsman which takes all the cliches, injects steroids into them and turns the awesomeness level up to the max, which is pretty much this show.
DO NOT take this show seriously, just sit back (if you get time from preventing your balls/make-shift balls from falling) and enjoy the fuck out of it.",9,StormRuler45

                In the past, I've watched several anime series involving humans with superpowers like Dragon Ball Z and Naruto and cartoons about superheroes like Superman, Batman, Spiderman and so much more. Now, this anime series redefines the superhero/superpower genre. 
The review rundown:
Story: One Punch Man's story is about a man named Saitama who is just (oh well) a hero for fun where he takes out every single monster and supervillain, who tries to terrorize the city, in just a single punch hence the name of the series title. Later, a cyborg named Genos appears to search the person responsible for the destruction of his village and
                  later becomes Saitama's disciple to hone his skills to destroy the culprit. (Ahem, no spoiler please) Anyway, the story is very simple at first but it becomes deeper as it progresses plus there is a lot of laughs, jokes and running gags just like any other anime out there. Every episode has villains which the main characters has to fight just like the rogues gallery from most comic book series.
Character:  The characters of the story are diverse plus each character including Saitama himself have different personalities in which the viewers can enjoy watching it. The villains appear every episode brings color to the series itself just like any superhero tv series. Plus, some of the characters are parodies from other anime series (Spoiler Alert!) such as Vaccine Man who looks like Piccolo from Dragon Ball series which can bring memories to older generations.
Art and Animation: The series is animated by Madhouse and the character designs are created by ONE. The animation quality is awesome plus the flashy special effects during fight scenes such as Saitama's punches that bring awesome results. The art shift of the characters that fits their personality which totally fits from the webcomic such as Saitama's ""OK"" face and Tatsumaki's chibi mode.
Sound: The sounds and music of this anime are awesome. The opening theme The Hero!!~Okoreru Kobushi ni Hi wo Tsukero~ by JAM Project is eargasmic since it is very cool and I've got a Last Song Syndrome upon hearing the song especially from the first phrase ""ONE PUUUUUUUUNNNNNCCCHHHH!!!!"".  The voice actors are really good and they bring all-star cast members:
For the Japanese version, it features well-known seiyuu like Yuki Kaji (Eren Yaeger of Attack on Titan), Aoi Yuki (Iris of Pokemon the series Black and White), Unsho Ishizuka (Professor Oak of Pokemon the anime), Tessho Genda (Duke Togo A.K.A. the eponymous Golgo 13 of Golgo 13:Queen Bee) and so much more.
The English dubbed version is no joke, it features voice actors from video games, cartoons and other anime series such as Max Mittleman (Kousei Arima of Your Lie in April) , Zach Aguilar (Slaine Troyard of Aldnoah Zero), Todd Haberkorn (Natsu Dragneel of Fairy Tail), Ray Chase (Noctis of Final Fantasy XV), Keith Silverstein (Hawk Moth of Miraculous Ladybug and Nazeem of Skyrim), Marieve Herington and Laura Post (Honoka Kousaka and Nozomi Tojo of Love Live!) and so much more. Plus, there are voice actors from Funimation Entertainment joining the party such as Christopher Sabat and Mike McFarland (Piccolo and Baby of Dragon Ball series).
Enjoyment: The series is totally enjoyable because it is not your ordinary superhero/superpower anime has to offer because there are a lot of comedy which brings you a good laugh to many viewers which deviates most of the superhero media.",10,The_Anonymous28

                One Punch Man is a series one will either love, or hate, there's no two ways about it. As someone who started with ONE's webcomic, and moved to Murata's redrawn version, I was hoping this series would get an anime someday, and my prayers have been answered. Having caught up with both mangas, I will judge the anime as an adaptation of said mangas. (mostly)
Story: 4
It's hard to rate the story of One Punch Man because the series doesn't really have one. It's episodic in nature, while having a single premise which is character based (Saitama being strong and trying to deal with it). 
Art:
                  9 
The anime does the redrawn version justice. Everything looks sharp, the direction of the fight scenes is just right, everything is smooth and looks beautiful. Effort was obviously put in this series and it shows. I wish fights were this awesome everywhere.
Sound: 9
The soundtrack is simply awesome. I had no idea what kind of soundtrack would fit the series, but its current OST fits the anime so well, I can't imagine any other OST working better for the anime even if I tried. 
Characters: 9
The characters are typical tropes (some pushed to the extreme), which means they aren't overly deep. That being said, they don't have to be. None of them are unlikable, all of them are epic in their own way, and they work well within the series, so it's a success. 
Overall: 9 
This is a pretty awesome anime, doing both Murata's as well as ONE's versions justice in delivering the shock value, the epicness, as well as the funny moments of the author(s). It's a flawless adaptation of the original material. 
-Now a comment on the series in general:
People who didn't like the series bring up some valid points, not gonna argue with that, but that doesn't mean the series isn't enjoyable -far from it.
I honestly believe that people who didn't like the series simply have different taste. There's nothing wrong with the series itself because it truly delivers on the things it sets out to do.
My recommendation for the series in general is -whatever reviews or rants you read about here- try it for yourself and see if you like it, because it's very different from your typical shounen. There's humour, trolling, as well as epicness to be had. The only real question is: Is it your cup of tea? Try it and see for yourself.",9,MrAgonious

I remember watching the Incredibles too. I'm not a die hard super hero fan, but I do like them, so imagine my surprise when I find out about the anime One Punch Man.  As someone who likes superheros, anime and morbid humor, this was a match made in heaven for me.
I love how One Punch Man is essentially a parody of shonen anime and super heroes. What really drew me in was the morbid humor and Saitama's unemotional
                  and apathetic personality and especially, the villains' reaction to him. All too often I'm use to seeing the villain be imposing and scary yet...with this anime it's the opposite, the hero is so over powered that the villains are TERRIFIED of fighting him.

                Such a new and refreshing way to tell a story from a heroes/Protagonist point of view. It's not the same as your typical story where the protagonist requires more strength/power and somehow just pulls a powerup out of their arse. This hero has a new kind of struggle, the struggle to get recognized for his deeds and strength. You'll have to watch it to understand what I mean and trust me you will love it. This hero is so strong that he instantly defeats his opponents and in doing so no one believes him, they think someone else did it or that he cheated somehow
                  or that the enemy was never strong to begin with. He never gets the recognition he deserves which adds a great deal of comedy to this anime. Seriously the best anime I've ever seen and i highly recommend it.",10,anthian

Last night I started AND finished this short  12- episode series all in a swoop.
Why was I up until 1-2 in the morning finishing this anime?
Because unlike a lot of other anime I see now, this was humorous, enjoyable and overall- fun.
Fighting off countless monsters and trying to rise in popularity, Saitama and his friend Genos have each other's backs, only adding to the show even more.
It had a great introduction and an amazing end; if I ever got sick or felt down- this is the show I'd turn to.
With this, it helps viewers realize deeper meaning behind much power.

                Ahhhh One Punch Man. Some call it the Attack on Titan of 2015 and that it saved anime. I call it something fun to watch every week.
I'll talk about the positives first: 
-The characters
This is in my opinion the show's biggest strength, each character has their own personality, opinions, motivations and quirks. This makes the show very enjoyable to watch as you see a huge variety of people that interact with each other.
-The comedy
This show has to be one of the funniest of 2015. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this show that it would be hard to count. As a result
                  the main goal of the series succeeds with flying colors. If you're well versed in the anime world, you'll notice jabs and references to other tropes, genres and stereotypes that are flat out hilarious however even if you aren't you should get a kick out of it nonetheless.
-The music
The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic in this show. It hits all the right tones at all the right moments. Also the opening is f*cking amazing.
Now the negatives:
-The story
Whilst the concept is quite unique and executed perfectly, the show feels very episodic and it's hard to argue that there's any real plot at all, especially in the first half.
Other than that I only have extremely minor issues and One Punch Man is definitely worth watching. 
All in all I rate ""One Punch Man"" with an 8/10",8,Prorogon

                First of all, the cover doesn't look much like a parody anime so I was definitely taken aback even at episode 1. However, I've always like parodies so why not? 
If there's one thing I like about this anime is definitely the animation especially during battle scenes. In fact, of all the anime's I've watched so far, this is definitely the best in comparison and also the reason I re-watched this anime a few more times. Continuing, I like how the author is able to link almost every character from the previous episodes to get some screen time on further episode presenting a sense of
                  continuity. Lastly, some projection on our society and nature really got me because I wasn't expecting it especially from a parody anime.
Honestly, I don't have any dislikes for this anime because it's pretty much a combination of everything to make a good anime in my opinion.
Conclusively, if you're looking for an action anime with a punch of parody in it, this is the one to go!",10,HoneyMelonn

                ""I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun"";
Saitama is unimpressed with being a hero, defeating all his foes with just one punch has become tiring, and it just bores him now. He finally got his dream in life, but it's nothing he can enjoy. He's too strong.
Genos begs him to be his sensei, which is where the fun begins. In a town seemingly full of villains and fellow heroes, Saitama wants to find a fight that will excite him, while Genos wants to learn strength from the strongest man he's ever met.
It doesn't take itself seriously at all, which is part of it's charm.
                  Saitama is so nonchalant about everything, he doesn't really care about things unless they're going to be a nuisance to him. 
Everybody judges him for looking different and because of his poor results on the written exams, he's considered one of the lower classes of heroes. He's okay with that because he's not a hero for praise, he does it for his own happiness. 
It is short, but it's enough episodes for a good first season. The fights, considering what they are, are pretty satisfying. They have enough action to keep you into it. The different animation style makes a great impression and the humor is nicely done. The different super powers are interesting, if they were to delve more into it there's some that aren't common which is nice to see, plus the hero names are pretty great too. It just adds to how it doesn't take itself seriously at all. But they suit their characters.
The soundtrack is awesome. It's a good thing to just lay around and watch casually or all at once. Overall I enjoyed it, it was certainly worth watching and I'm looking forward to the second season.",8,Mikame-

                Who is the most powerful character in the anime universe? This is a question that has been raised countless times over the years, as anyone who watches action-packed anime is interested in seeing powerful characters on the screen. One of the brilliant qualities of shonen anime is the feeling you get when you see new characters who are quite strong, and you don't know how strong, or what they can do. One Punch Man delivered that facet, with its Hero Association allocated into several ""classes"" based on merit and power. It's a C-B-A-S system similar to that for gauging quests in Fairy Tail.
The answer? It's
                  without a doubt Saitama from One Punch Man (OPM). In every other anime I've seen with ridiculously powerful characters, whenever they fight they are hurt to some degree -- but Saitama, my friend, is practically invulnerable. He's invulnerable and makes the title apt, as he typically defeats all enemies with one punch. Yeah, it makes the fights predictable, but the premise and background story of OPM and the other characters makes watching OPM still great. Saitama and Genos, the cyborg, are now in my top n favorite characters list. I say n favorite characters because each time I watch a new anime more characters are added to what would be a top 10 list but far more than 10 appear on that list.
Did I mention Genos? Have you seen Iron Man? Take what Tony Stark can do in his suit and maximize its potential, jack it on steroids, and you get Genos, the cyborg whose array of built-in weapons and athletic ability just puts Stark and Marvel to shame. Hell, Saitama can take on all of the Avengers, Thanos, every hero and villain in the Marvel and DC universes and beat them all. Poor Saitama constantly faces an existential crisis, seeking a formidable opponent that won't blow up into smithereens after a single punch. Here's a quote from OPM about Saitama:
""This planet's finest warrior... I can sense no limit to his energy.""
Seeing OPM has further convinced me that Madhouse is one of the greatest anime studios of all time. The animation, in comparison to Parasyte especially, was refreshingly clear and aesthetically pleasing. The disarray of Saitama's bedroom, the various monsters he encounters, the fights, Genos's badass moves, everything else about the cities, was very well done. The soundtrack, too, was superb and matched the awesomeness of Saitama.
There is a reason why OPM is the third-highest rated anime series on IMDB. It provides a different look at power -- rather than watch a protagonist struggle and endure and train to grow stronger, why not see a protagonist with overwhelmingly superior capabilities that doesn't have to do all that?",9,Jusaku-Redai

                8/10 I guess
I was asked to watch this anime by my friends and by its population. I was being preview that it's fucking good and therefore I have a shortfalls after watching it.
Well first the storyline was ok, the best line about it IMO is that Saitama (the main char) is so strong that he lost his enthusiasm in fighting bad guy. I kind of feel sorry for the guy cause as for me the best part of every fight I watched in anime was the spirit shown in their fights, and the twist in them too.
Since the storyline was that he beats his enemy
                  just in one punch that make the anime somehow bore and predictable.
But beside from that, while I watch it Saitama kind of reminded me to my favorite character (and that's Gintoki). I think they're really alike and therefore again make me less into the anime, since my taste was that every character have their unique line. And some story are common to Gintama too.
However the art was really well done, it's amazing and enjoyable and that was the reason I kept watching it till the end I guess
Overall it's a nice anime to watch, it's enjoyable and since it's short it's alright for you to watch!",8,Joy4ever

                While I did enjoy this show, I felt that I could have been watching something better.
""Was it interesting?"" The world was well built. The characters wer'ent all they could be. The plot was lacking overall. The whole show is based on a gimmick.

""Was it entertaining?"" Oh yeah! I like fighting as much as anyone. I especially like the comedy to be on the light side. Most anime comedy is grating to me.

                One Punch Man is a really bandwagon that everyone has jumped on and loved. However, that is because it is damn well deserved. 
Honestly, on paper I feel like I'd rate this as a 7 or an 8. Making a practically invincible protagonist and playing with shonen tropes seems like it could make a good series, but it doesn't strike me as a 10 across the board. OPM earned its 10 through execution, not just by premise. 
To begin with, the action is awesome. The series continually introduces new characters and villains who almost always have interesting abilities and fighting sequences. The art is fantastic
                  and accentuates the battles well. The plot is good. The overarching plot (Saitama's progression as a hero) works each threat Saitama deals with is presented well. The humor definitely works well. 
But my favorite part of the series (both anime, manga, and the webcomic), is delving into the world of OPM. The gradual feeding of backstory and states of the world is interesting, 
The thing is, it is hard to explain why OPM is so good. Like I said, on paper it's a 7 or an 8 in my book. For me, they just execute the plot and the humor so damn well that the show feels perfect. I generally keep my ratings low (6.5 avg) so that my 10's mean something, and OPM is definitely a 10.",10,esaoud

That coolness. Bald, pajamas, yellow all over. Definitely not your typical super hero, but to me, and perhaps all its viewers, Saitama is the history of coolness, the root of all bad assery. His shining bald head grows exceedingly bright, outshining even a star, when he punches, his trade mark move, one-punch. Not exciting? guess again. This 12 episode series is full of that move yet somehow, people are so interested with their fighting scenes. Curious? Even more curious is the long on-going manga, in which this anime is based upon.

                After watching One Punch Man I felt compelled to write a review for the first time. So keep in mind this isn't something I normally do while reading through this review and also I'm going to go through it working with the scoring system which uses the different sections to score the anime. 
 Story 8/10
The story of One Punch Man, is arguable one of the weakest point of the anime. The story itself revolves around what I consider to be two main characters of Saitama who is average looking guy, with over the top strength and Genos the cyborg who wants to learn from
                  Saitama. Now although the story is pretty solid and for me flows quite nicely from episode to episode, my main problem with it is that it feels like its holding back a bit and doesn't progress the story as much as other animes of similar length (12/13 episodes). Another slight downside to the story is due to the nature of Saitama's character you'll very quickly see that fights aren't the main focus point which is kinda of a shame and I'll explain later in the Art section why I feel that way. But despite that it allows the anime to focus more on actual characters which leads to some great comedy moments with the interaction of characters and some good character building and depth of Saitama and Genos. 
Art 9/10
The art and animation is a great asset to the anime with its own nice style. It seems to me that the art style puts emphasis on the awesome fight scenes by making Saitama more detailed during the fights and being serious but giving him a simplistic feel outside of fights which helps comedy moments and when he doesn't understand what people are saying. Due to the fact that Saitama is quite basic in looks, it allows for other characters to look more bizarre in comparison and unique. Not just Genos with his cyborg looks and weaponary, but other characters (mainly other heroes) which creates a great aura about themselves. I should mention that the animation improves as the episodes go along, most notably in the opening which did have a side by side comparison on youtube of the original opening and then the same opening in later episodes which shows the improvements made, although its likely to be taken down by now.  Now as I mentioned in the previous section of the review I said that it was a shame that they wasn't more fight scenes. This is because the fight scenes are one of the best qualities of this anime due to the flow of animation and art, and the fact that fighting scenes tend to be not that long, it makes me wanting for more which the story clearly doesn't really allow for. 
Sound 8/10
ONE PPPPUUUNNNCCCCHHHHH! Is basically what is going to get stuck in your head when you hear the opening song for the anime. The opening song is what will get you hyped up into watching the anime. The song is amazing, it will make you feel like you are going to get pumped up into some great anime and action. In contrast the ending song is more relaxing and chilled. Which helps you to wind down after each episode. There isn't anything wrong with the sound but the reason I haven't given it more in terms of score is due to the fact the soundtrack within the anime itself doesn't particularly stand out to me, however I will say it doesn't really do anything wrong.
Characters 9/10
Basically the characters are great. From Saitama and Genos, to the random enemies, to the background characters and even the other heroes. The vast majority all have they own look, personality and chemistry between each other. Saitama and Genos have a great relationship with each other which makes the anime really enjoyable. The enemies have they own small backstories which they usually get across in a small time frame and don't outstay they welcome with pointless monologuing that some other animes are guilty of. My only complaint is that other heroes don't really get enough time to show off themselves but that is more likely due to the fact that the show is only 12 episodes long.
Enjoyment 10/10
There wasn't a single moment where I felt bored or that the episodes were dragging on too long. I couldn't wait for each episode and not only did I loved watching it, but it also caught the attention of my dad who ended up wanting to watch it with me even though he generally doesn't understand the appeal of anime or like anime in general. This shows to me that it can capture the interest of people who may not like anime or bring in people into the anime scene. 
Overall 10/10
I will mention now that I only score anime from 6-10 because usually animes that I would rate 5 or lower don't catch my attention enough for me to watch longer then generally a couple of episodes before forgetting all about them. For animes I rate from 6-10, I rate on my own enjoyment of the anime, how off putting any potential plot holes, characters, story etc are, and if I feel I could re-watch the anime and still feel satisfied from watching it all again. For One Punch Man I feel like not only did I really enjoyed watching it, I will probably watch this anime over and over again within the coming years and any problems I have mentioned isn't enough that it will to put me off or to give it a lower score then a 10.",10,PatheticRanger

                Strap yourselves in for an honest review of One Punch Man! 
One Punch Man is the kind of anime that anyone could watch, whether or not they have seen other anime before. I have recommended this to non-anime watchers before and most often, it gets them into liking anime and watching more. Now let’s jump into the meat of this review.
Story:       7.63 / 10
The story of One Punch Man (which I will from now abbreviate as OPM) has but one goal: to be entertaining and comedic. As such, you shouldn’t expect anything mind-blowing. I classify this kind of story
                  as “brainless fun”. And fun it is. In my opinion, lacking an intense story would normally make something boring to me, but in this case, OPM fulfills its purpose so well, that I didn’t find it in the least bit boring.
Art:	   9.65 / 10
Not much to say here, the animation is great. Even the fight scenes that have very jagged lines and harsh movement work brilliantly, as these effects put you as viewer in the middle of the action. The environment looks great, the color palette is used well and the action scenes are great to look at.
Sound:	     9.2 / 10
I watched OPM both subbed and dubbed, so I can confess that the voices were well done in both. At first, I was worried that the main character’s English voice would be bad, since the main character is such a peculiar one to portray, but to my surprise, the English dub handled the voices pretty well. The sound during the action scenes were also good and the music would energize the viewer appropriately. The opening of OPM is also fun and upbeat – fitting perfectly with the overall tone of the show.
Character:    6.75 / 10
You shouldn’t expect amazing character arcs in OPM. Really, the only character that has any kind of real depth is Genos, whose character arc isn’t over yet. In reality, the entertainment comes from the strange character that is Saitama (the main character). There is no real character development for him. I don’t, however, feel like this takes away much of my enjoyment of the series. The character designs are very unique and interesting (and mostly hilarious).
Enjoyment:    9.8 / 10
As enjoyable as they come. The visuals, fights and humor make it fun to watch, no matter how many times you have seen it before. It is also short enough that it doesn’t take much from you to re-watch it. Really fun, but might not be so appealing to you if you desire majorly intricate storylines or deep, emotional character arcs.
Overall:	         8.52 / 10
Very close to a masterpiece. The main thing it lacks is emotional or psychological impact, so do not expect to cry or contemplate life after watching it, but do expect to laugh and enjoy it all the way through.",8,H31NST31N

                Hoo-boy where do I start with this gem? Well, before I even watched it, I knew that I would like it. The premise is amazing, a guy with an overpowered ability.
The show is an enjoyable ride throughout the entire series (currently 12 episodes), and every episode was filled with laughter. Not to mention the great animation, that create impactful scenes. I can't say too much without spoilers, but I can say the high octane (not to mention very brief) action,  the comedy, and the characters are the reason why I give this anime my seal of approval and  why I also recommend that
                  you go watch it right now. Remember: ONE PUNNNNCHHH!!!",9,Soda-Stroyed

                Saitama, the hero every body would really want to watch, though he has a seriously serious look on him just about always because he always bored.
seriously, I got bored watching superman beat up lame cliche super villains who want to take over the world, One punch man introduces a new way of enjoying overpowered characters, I mean just Imagine being able to take out any enemy no matter how powerful with just one freaking punch.That may sound like an anime that's not worth 12 episodes but watching One punch man's main character, Saitama, as he comically takes down one over confident and noisily boasting enemy
                  after the other is really refreshing for people who love watching over confident bad guys getting beat up stupid. 
Neither the story nor the plot really matter in this anime in my opinion because the enjoyment is just too damn awesome, every episodes builds up so well to the awesome fights.Although just about every character in this anime is clearly overpowered, watching the awesome fights was nothing short of incredible.
One punch man is not one of those cliche super hero stories where the main character comes of from some tragic accidents that kills both his parents and he somehow finds a reason to fight evil in his youth(perhaps am trashing superman too much), No! He's just an average guy without any super powers, bored with life and just decides to become a super hero because he thought it might be fun, as it happens, he comes to the realization that he is the strongest their is and no enemy will ever be able to withstand his one punch, at least that's what he thought in the beginning.",8,mcrider
30276,"
                One Punch Man's satire about superheroes is hilarious enough in theory and it is animated by a credible studio (Madhouse) that is an expert when it comes to the shounen genre. Many bought the show's premise to the extent that it jolted right at the top fifteen of MAL's best rated animes. Did it live in its hype? Yes, but with reservations. 
Art and Sound: 10/10
If there is a compelling reason as to why this should be included as one of the best animes in 2015, the artwork and the animation can fully explain why. The artwork is no doubt one of the year's best.
                  Colors are vividly drawn, the monsters of the week were carefully given details to standout and it is always amusing whenever Saitama switches from his usual face to a serious one. In addition, the level of artwork is at the all-time high in anime and did not falter through the course of its run. I was not prepared to see such awesomeness blasting through my computer screen.
More so, the level of sakuga per episode in One Punch Man is probably the highest I have seen in an anime series so far. Fight scenes are fluid and Madhouse seemed to exhaust their funds with these. Every episode does not disappoint in showing fairly choreographed fights. These moments are normally seen in the climactic moments of a typical action series but in this show, highly budgeted cinematography is just the norm. 
The soundtrack does not disappoint either as it complements the satirical nature of One Punch Man. The OP in particular, is a real visual and auditory treat. Yet it can be serious enough whenever Saitama's about to change his mood and engage in his epic fights. Again, its usage was as if it is a mockery of other series.
Now, why can't I give One Punch Man a higher rating?
Story and Character: 4/10
A satire which includes a hero who defeats his enemies with a single punch and a mockery of shounen series is chuckle worthy and the first episode delivered just what the viewer wants. Yet for it to work in the long run, it must not be predictable or there must be at least a greater plot. One Punch Man struggles in this part so far because of its paper-thin plot. 
Without a central plot, no amount of sakuga scenes can cover One Punch Man's tendencies to rehash some of its themes. A monster of the week approach is fine but a change in the show's formula is really appreciated (for the next season, there has to be one) because its brand of satire started to wear thin near the end of episode one and begins to feel repetitive at episode three. Sure, we were given well animated scenes that are sometimes wobbly choreographed since explosion is not equal to a good fight and worse, we have already predicted what will happen next by then. 
Thankfully, a Hunter x Hunter parody at episodes five and six seemed to cover this problem but the monster of the week theme of this show is really recurrent which plagued its first cour. However, the Deep Sea King Arc is what One Punch Man at its best because it manages to mix action and emotional scenes seamlessly. 
The jokes in One Punch Man are also hit and miss. I find myself laughing at some parts (Saitama's dream of becoming a popular hero) and being really irritated to some (Geno's really long introduction about himself) The series might be self aware to its shortcomings but it does not give it a leeway when the humor fails.
Saitama as a character is fine but we need to know more about him other than being the absurdly strong superhero who torpedoes himself for the sake of others. Genos was relatively fleshed and likable but is not exactly entertaining for laughs even if his existence is meant to be used for satire. For others? Aside from the green haired loli who courts the boundary of cute and irritating, they are mostly stereotypes who exist for the purpose of satire. 
Enjoyment: 7/10
In the end, it really felt like the Madhouse's version of Nichijou where the animators are given freedom in their creativity but the comedy cannot keep up with the level of animation. Sure, if you're into animes because of the visuals, then this show is perfect for you.",7,samui26

                What lacks in substance, or ability to connect emotionally with it's audience I feel makes up with it's comedy and what I suppose would be parody. Point is, I found this very enjoyable to watch. As a whole, at least. Sometimes I feel like the problems were too petty or unconvincing even for a joke but then I realized it was only 12 episodes 22~ minutes each. 
The story had no arc, but they were building up towards something I believe will be in the second season. It's fair, each episode's theme was humorous and entertaining enough to view but not good enough to take
                  seriously, and that's what I suppose they aimed for. Well done.
The characters were diverse, to muscle-beast masculinity to androgynous ninja, even a small girl. That's not to say they had any real depth in personality, what you see on the surface is what you get throughout. It's hard to take a review seriously when the show doesn't take itself seriously, seriously. Give it a watch, it's short and you don't have to commit any feelings.

                OK, this is seriously... gonna be my first review, but let's do this! :D
I'll try my very best NOT to add spoilers... :)
So, as I was flicking through stuff to watch, nothing fancy, I came across 'One Punch Man'. This suddenly spiked my interest because I have heard many talking about 'One Punch Man', a man, seriously, that punches anything into oblivion. I'm not really into sci-fi or mecha because, let's be honest, if I was smart, I really wouldn't be watching anime.
I've read the synopsis before, so I was like ""Why not?"" and watched the first episode...
OMG, I could not stop laughing. Saitama (main
                  character and protagonist) is the strongest in the world! But, sadly, makes him the most bored in the world. Why? Because none can match his strength.
~Story~ (7/10):
First three episodes, I couldn't find a storyline. It was like everything was just made up as they went along. But in the last couple of episodes, I did find, some-what, a storyline. It was rather weak in my opinion, and didn't have that complexity I was really looking for. Some examples would be: Attack on Titan and/or FMA.
~Art~(7/10):
Up-to-date. But the action scenes really bring out its full potential, like wowowowow. I could not keep my eyes off the screen. But, sometimes I was thinking the producers kinda got lazy and went ""Yup, this is it. This- abomination. Yup."" Not to say it was totally bad, but there are better. 
~Sound~(8/10):
I was listening to my jam, all day and night. It really kept me pumped up. Plus, the voice acting (mind you, I've only watched the sub) was excellent. Nothing to really complain about here.
~Character~(6/10):
Character development through the whole anime kinda was like a roller coaster, up and down. While there was room for improvement, I did like how the characters are portrayed. 'Cause, I love Genos... my bae.
~Enjoyment~(9/10):
I really did enjoy the anime, overall. I was sometimes at the edge of my seat, wondering what will Saitama or Genos do. My favourite part, was singing the opening. 
~Overall~:
While there should have been a bit more detail and suspense added, I think the anime makes a great addition to being one of the most popular anime series seen or heard of (Although in a couple more years time, this anime will be lost, lol). I definitely would recommend watching 'One Punch Man' if you need a break from the feels... ;-; or just want a laugh, or maybe a bit of superpower/mecha/whatever action.",8,KyubiTheSnowFox

                While this anime had lots of potential (and hype), it ultimately turned into a caricature of what it was satirizing in the first place.
Because this series is episodic, I didn't find the story arcs satisfying. The characters were underdeveloped, even though they often had great first impressions. But my greatest critique is in how it advertised itself versus how it was actually presented. I love the concept of a superhero who is unsatisfied and unfulfilled because they are overpowered. Unfortunately, this theme was never explored in depth, and so the satire wasn't as much a satire as a bad guy of the week.
But there are
                  some truly hilarious moments (Saitama's explanation of his workout routine, for example), and the art was very well done. I also finished it. So there's that.",6,loafer
30276,"
                I really enjoyed watching this show. I found it really easy to digest. Some people criticize it for just being what it is supposed to parody. I agree that it is what it purports to parody, however, I found that it did the battles so well that I really enjoyed that aspect of it, all parody aside. The heroes have well-defined classes. If a hero in a class gets beat, you know whoever he fought will give another hero in the class a good fight, and possibly win.
I found the soundtrack well-produced and pleasing, but understated and not very memorable. I feel like they really
                  could've done more with it.
Overall, the clarity and good construction just kind of absorbed me. I sort of found it like watching a sports match and really caring about the outcome. I didn't care about the characters so much that I really cared about their struggles, but I did care enough to feel connected to the action, which normally doesn't happen when I watch action shows.
I had the same sort of feeling about Sword Art Online. I just enjoyed the show more than it seems I should when I analyze the individual component, so it comes out to more than the sum of its parts somehow.",7,awfabian

                One Punch Man is what this masterpiece of a anime is called. This is one of the few animes that really hit the spot for me and where I just can't get enough of. This anime is filled with action and comedy and just who can't love Saitama with his goofy face.
Story: 10/10. 
The story is really good and it covers a lot in just 10 episodes. One Punch Man is about Saitama who is so strong that he defeats everyone in just one punch. Says it in the title. But since he is so overpowered, he gets bored of his own strength and that
                  he can't find a challenge in this world. Then a cyborg appears and he get Saitama to join the Hero Association so that he can become a certified hero. He then aims to climb up the ranks in the association (in order to be famous) and try to find someone that can take more than just one punch. 
Art: 10/10. 
The art is just amazing in this anime. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters feel natural and unique at the same time. But what really stands out is the fighting scenes. The flashy battles with the slow motions and the destruction is just amazing to watch. It is like you never want to see anything else than fighting scenes from this anime ever again. Truly a masterpiece.
Sound: 10/10.
The sound of each punch, flight, landing, explosion, robotic sound and even Saitamas cape makes me hyped and just appreciate every second the anime has to offer. The One Punch Man's songs is also catching and gets me even more hyped every time I start on a new episode. Truly a great job done by Madhouse!
Characters: 10/10.
I just want to start by saying that I love Saitama and how he is so dumb. It really makes you love him even more. And of course we got Genos the cyborg. He is more a serious guy who really contrast against Saitama. We got the goofy guy and we go the serious guy and the duo is just hilarious. Can't get enough of these characters and no one knows what they might end up doing next.
Enjoyment: 10/10.
There is no way you can't smile or feel hyped watching One Punch Man. It is like a mix of emotions heating up inside you and you can't get enough. I have already watched this anime three times and when I am writing this review I want to see it again. That is just how much I enjoy this show!
Overall: 10/10.
Overall... outstanding! There is nothing coming to mind when I think of something that could be done better. If you like action or/and comedy this anime is for you. Personally, everyone should watch it even though you like another genre better. You might end up enjoying it more than you think. But this is one of my ""MUST WATCH ANIME"" and btw suuuper hyped for season 2.",10,Alca

                I was rather excited to watch One Punch Man, given the constant hype surrounding it. This show is probably one of the most popular anime in recent years, so I simply had to find out why - and sadly, I now remember why people say 'don't believe the hype'.
~STORY~
In terms of story, it would be accurate to say that One Punch Man doesn't really have one. Of course there is the basic premise - a young cyborg becomes an unlikely hero's apprentice - but beyond that the anime has little plot. Instead, it is more of a 'monster of the week' type story, which can
                  be fun, but after a while I found rather tedious. I feel as though there were lots of interesting narrative avenues that the show could've explored but didnt, such as the backstory of Genos or the beginnings of the Hero Association. After a few episodes, the format of the episodes becomes predictable and for this reason I did not think One Punch Man had a good story. 
~ART~
The art, for me, is One Punch Man's redeeming factor. The character designs are very unique and stylised and the animation is consistent and flows well.
~SOUND~
The voice actors also did a great job, particularly in the case of Saitama. The music also fits the moods and events of the episodes.
~CHARACTER~
The characters are....okay. The strength of One Punch Man's characters lies in Saitama, the One Punch Man himself. He is a unique anti-hero and brings a lot of comedy to the series, and I often found him to be quite unpredictable which is always exciting. Genos is also rather likeable in his bravery and dedication to Saitama. However, the rest of the characters faded into the background for me. The show features little character building and a lot of characters seemed to be just stereotypes. 
Overall:
Overall I would give One Punch Man a 5/10. Whilst it is fun at first, the endless predictability of the episodes left me feeling bored and the lack of character development or deeper story made me rapidly lose interest. Whilst it has its entertaining and comedic moments, I'm afraid there is only so many times I can watch Saitama defeat a foe with one punch before I am utterly sick of it.",5,venusinfleursx

                First time writing a review for an animation on this site, so the varied categories are helpful for being more precise with what you like about a show, but in a way that only makes the digression of assigning a number to something all the more difficult, especially for someone with such a limited experience of anime like me.
So I'll leave it at a 6, which for me really means a 3/5, I like that scale better. The show was fine enough, not as funny as I thought it was going to be. Thinking back on it, the only part I can remember enjoying and
                  laughing was Saitama going off at the Hero training test and the switch from the normal artstyle to the intense artstyle. But beyond that there wasn't anything touching about the show, not even the idea of Saitama feeling depression from it all.
By the end I can only think of the show as mildly interesting. It's almost like the opposite of Mob Psycho 100 for me. Mob was a show that kind of got me back into the fun feeling of shonen anime like watching Naruto when I was younger, but once the anime was done I had no real desire to watch any more of it. Now with One Punch Man, I didn't enjoy it that much-just wanted to get through it quickly-but now would like to even go read the later issues. Everyone knew by the end of the anime that there is nothing left for Saitama to really do, and now we only have certain plot threads to go through with the other heroes bickering with each other. If that's where the writer wants to really go with it, then I'll read it, because right now that sounds kind of interesting, but as for the show, it was perfectly fine and others may find it fun, but I won't be rewatching.",6,thestarsailor

                One-Punch Man is like a parody of anime superhero that we usually see. superhero usually come from ordinary people who areweak then train hard or experience strange things that can be strong. In the anime usual super hero, hero usually lost first, then at the end suddenly issued a silver bullet and opponents were defeated. There will not be anyone like that in One-Punch Man. saitama, the protagonist has been strong from the beginning and can defeat the enemy only with one o'clock. The first hearing must be confused. Then how how to beat him? ifthe direct opponents lost no fun then? .. nah, this
                  is the uniqueness of this anime. Even though it looks simple but there is a very intriguing fight because a lot of super hero characters in this anime. In fact, there is the association of all .. One-Punch Man offers a story more interesting than any other super hero anime too seriously. cool fighting scene tilled typical madhouse. Built also different atmosphere when saitama show innocent face and as he alternated serious face. Anime is certainly going to give you something different from anime - the usual superhero anime you watch. And again the second season of the anime will be released in april later. So do not wait.",9,Fueeru

                One of the best anime I have watched. Characters are the FUNNIEST, yet powerful. I really feel bad for the villains :( There is no episode when someone is serious.
The opening, oh my. It's very glorious, especially if you love rock/(sort of) heavy metal. These are the kinds of songs that you will love, even though you don't know the lyrics
The story is just the best. THERE IS LITERALLY NO EPISODE WHERE IT'S SERIOUS. The shortness of the fighting scenes never get old. Yusuke Murata did a good job at making stories.
So to conclude my review, i give one punch man an  ∞/10.

                This show is great! After watching hunter x hunter, the bar was set high, and this show did not disappoint. Great action, comedy, characters, story, everything. It was pretty cool watching an anime which the main character is unstoppable (yet the fights are always still intriguing). I'd recommend this to anyone, I think most people, anime watchers or not, would enjoy this show. 
All-around quality and art is really good. I love the hero system. I like how whenever they introduce a new hero (especially those A-S tier ones) you always want to know more about them and each is unique in their own way.
                  
I don't want to spoil much, but I am really interested to see what will happen to some characters in season 2. Most notably, Saitama, Genos, Metal Knight, revealing Blast, Boros, Amai, and more!
I am looking forward to season 2!",9,snakepit

                I will be genuinely honest here: My review is strongly prejudiced in favor of One Punch man. I see it as nothing less than a classic. I find it to be the single most awesome anime I have ever seen from among the modern anime I have seen.
I'll start from the top:
Character: The title of the anime is a dead give-away. Yet even with that said, One Punch Man delivers in the balance it puts of the (bloody awesome) abilities of Saitama-san (the protagonist, and THE MAN himself) - shown right from the onset of the anime - with the overall personalities of the people
                  (protagonists) who come and go in this anime. In fact, their ineptness (as well as incompetence) simply makes them look more human and - in my opinion - doubly adds to their three dimensional perspective of handling the obvious threats which endanger their residential city. the antagonists who come and go in this anime, sadly, are just paper constructs for one simple reason: One Punch Man.
Story: So far as the story is concerned, it was very brief - they played it safe by using only one arc to portray the development of Saitama. Sadly, for me, this is a weak point (even if other people will strongly disagree with me on it) because from the anime, one only appreciates the One Punch Man moments, rather than the ""actual"" story which is hinted in the first arc, but never developed. I won't say this is an excuse to give a low rating to the anime. Personally, I found that - even with the subtle liberties which were taken in the anime from the original manga material during the adaptation - it was true to the nature, and overall presentation of the manga as well as the arc in particular. For me, this anime used it's story to portray the characters really well, so in that respect, it is good enough to appreciate, but not adulate.
Art and Sound: In this anime, to be honest, both went side by side. It was a symbiotic causation, and it was awesome!!! I love the music in this anime!! The opening theme of ""The Hero"" is a song which I can listen to all day and not get bored, because it is so energizing. The music in the first episode of One Punch Man (as well as the part of the meteor threatening the fate of a city) is just epic. And overall, the characters and their reactions in general, not only fit the persona, they feel so much more alive when compared to the banal tone of Saitama (The One Punch Man). Which goes in favor of the anime.
Enjoyment: IT: IS: ONE: PUNCH: MAN.
Overall: This is my tl;dr on the matter: worth watching. This anime, even with a basic structured (and relative to the arc, childish) story, is mature in how it handles the characters and progression of the anime, and balances every moment in good steed. It is worth looking at once. Balls to the wall brilliance with one of the most awesome opening themes I've ever heard, and one of the best sequence of events to ever bear witness in any episode seen, any time.",9,shehrozeameen

                Well one punch man is a show which is getting mixed reactions , as some people completely liked it and some strongly disliked it.
 As for me, I enjoyed this show a lot and I'll tell you why.
The story is pretty simple ,it's about a man named saitama who is so strong that no opponent can even withstand one punch from him and he beats more or less every opponent with one punch.Saitama pretty much lives an ordinary life until he meets the cyborg named genos, who becomes saitama's disciple after seeing him fight.Genos urges saitama to join the hero association and together, they fight
                  various villains.
The main reason I like this show is because of saitama. He is such a fantastic character that I cannot help but like him, even if you don't like the show I would find it surprising for anyone to not like saitama. He has such a care free attitude and doesn't bother even if anyone criticizes him, which is one of his best qualities according to me.The show is filled with comedy and action which are both good.I also enjoyed the parody aspect of the anime and even though it may seem repetitive I personally enjoyed it.
The art is awesome as well,as you would expect from madhouse and all the action scenes are animated well.
Each person has a different taste and you may not like this anime if you are too much into plot or story but you will definitely enjoy this if you like something simple,filled with comedy and action so be sure to give this show a try, and who knows ,this might even become your favorite show!",9,swagmoto

                I'm going to evaluate backwards:
Enjoyment (10/10): The difficult part of creating a comedy is to insert a context that either a different group or a family will understand and will smile at it. You can see the result of its popularity by any age, I asked my mom (who thinks anime is for babies) to watch One Punch Man, and what? She love it, because the joke is mostly universal, comprehensive.
Character(10/10): Great psychological development. I start stopping focusing on Saitama since he's powerful with the same ""oh ok i'll solve this"" behavior. And it dragged me to watch only to see villain's/rank .. heroes/victim's reactions.
                  And besides Saitama's barely express himself, I felt loneliness and sadness after he defeat Boros. His silence over his victory seemed painful.
Sound(10/10): Impactful OST, addictive opening song that makes me want to sing everytime I hear. These songs brought power, not the ""haha what a funny music"" sensation that most comedies have.
Art (10/10): Attack effects, fighting scenes, ...",10,nMie
30276,"
                Overall this anime is stunning, while it may be easy to overlook it does have some decent story lines in it. the main is the protags struggle with power, not gaining it, but having too much. Even as a parody you can get a lot of empathy for the MC if you really look at how destructive his strength is to his own life.
This culminates in the final antagonist, a being with the same problems, and the anime made the end of the conflict as perfect as can be. the heartbeat, the music, the dialogue. all of it was perfect to express the only bit
                  of serious plot line attached to the protag.
Admittedly the saitama has very little story outside of this. instead, aside from his, what we get are the individual stories and actions of the people around him. in particular Mumen Rider, and the S-class heroes show quite a few interesting characters and motivations, making up for the static MC. So even with the downsides of the OP protag, you can still get the standard heart tugs and inspirational scenes. The story in OPM is both standard and not, you get to enjoy seeing the growth and motivations of everyone around saitama, and see the results of a man who had all those taken away by the very thing he wishes for.
Honestly 9 might be high for the story as is, but the first season was quite short so there is obviously a lot left to develop in the story. As such i'm leaving it up at 9  out of hope that the next season will bring out more.
As for Art... i really can't even say anything. Madhouse did a stunning job. the gurren lagan style warping that shows up now and then took some getting used to, but overall i think it was a great choice for this series, and they didn't over use the effect. Basically just take away that this is a beautiful anime, beyond what i expected... even from madhouse.
Sound. also perfect. from emotional to hype the music fits the anime perfectly. the SFX are perfect for everything... honestly doubt it could be better.
Character. While many may consider the character weak, i found them quite well done. Saitama is a little dead inside and a goof ball so his char may get disregarded, but it's still there. some of it gets blown off as a joke, but a few scenes really show it quite intensely. the true emotions of a man who lives for fighting... and will never get to fight again. instead he ends up seeing everyone else get the feeling he dreams of. watches them struggle and fight tooth and nail to overcome stronger foes... yet is never bitter about it. he just muddles through life not getting hung up on his own baggage. if you look for it under the comedy, it can really tug at your heart strings.
Enjoyment. Can we get an 11? the music pumps you up, the animation is eye porn, they comedy is funny, the fights are epic, and the story was more hard hitting then expected once i took a closer look. would, and do, rec this to everyone i know.
Overall this anime is definitely in my top 10.... a list that has remained almost entirely stagnate for 5+ years... i say almost because i'm still debating whether another newish anime is in top 10 or top 20. Even without it's second season it's firmly planted in the top 10... will probably rise to my all time favorite if season 2 is handled well.",10,SAimNE

                This Review is mostly Free of Spoilers
When you look at the Premise of the show, you might have thought ""wow looks like fun, but the one punch gimmick might get tiring and make the action boring"".
That was also what i thought unti:
- I heard about the hype that the series already has since 2009
(somehow I was unaware of that, I really need to get out of patrick's house sometimes),
- saw some cool art of it
- and the Fact that the one and only Madhouse is Responsible for making this show made me Enthusiastic. 
you could say that I also was caught in the hype of
                  the show like many others.
However this Hype is Actually JUSTIFIED.
One punch man began as an webcomic produced by the artist who is known is ONE, who did that just for FUN.
the web-comic became very popular online to the point where it became phenomenal (and yet somehow I missed it, thanks patrick).
after sometime, Murata Yusuke (who is known as the author of eyeshield 21) read the Comic and was so enthusiastic about that he made a proposal to make and Manga adaptation of the comic.
ONE agreed to that and after some time, the OPman manga got Serialized in 2012.
the Manga itself got allot of Praise/ positive reviews, and then Later on, you Guessed it, got an Anime Adaptation.
so in short, a web-comic that was made Just for fun became one of the most Popular series of this age!
Now on the the Actual review.
Story: 7 (Not going to tell the premise here)
The story itself is Very easy to follow, watcher friendly
and above all FUN.
the show has these short arcs that gradually get longer over time at a nice pace, Never making fights to long and very FUN.
the Comedy the show has is in form of a sort of a parody of the superhero/shounen genre, but was either a hit or miss and was mostly only there in form of ridiculous foes and Irony (all the villains get much build up, only to get Squashed easily) and the show kinda became the one thing that the show tried to make fun of at the end by going Serious. however the Action made up for all of that.
The show also didn't even try to be compelling or dramatic since it is Pure Action and Comedy and allot of us LOVE THAT
Characters: 7
lets begin with Seitama.
Seitama is just an hero who beats up bad guys for fun with a surprising heart of gold.
His Character is kinda refreshing since most Protag Heroes in Anime and comic have a sad Back-story and yadayadayada while Seitama doesn't have that and is just a Normal Baldy who One shots every Villain he meets and then gets a bit mad about that. He also acts pretty unimpressed (and -Ing) towards the Villains, who then in turn get pissed of by him which at times is funny, but wouldn't it have worked even better if he also Reacts towards others in a more Comedic way?
then there is Genoes, One who does have all the yadayadayada and Simply Admires Seitama up to the point where he became Seitama's Disciple (Ok the Review is not entirely Spoiler free).
He has a good Moral code and is ectually more like a Hero than Seitama is and the Comedy that comes from his Admiration for Seitama is pretty funny in the Beginning.
there also are quite a few of supporting Characters Like Sonic (NOT THE HEDGEHOG) who is the self-proclaimed Rival of Seitama, Mumen rider who is powerless and yet stands up the even the most Powerfull foes if he has to.
The Rank S heroes kinda lacked the Screen time to make them memorable and I was afraid that they would just be fodder.
however, the later Episodes showed them as capable fighters, proving that Seitama and Genos are Gladly not the only powerfull ones in the show (which was one of my Fears).
but the S rankers like all other supporting Characters still had not enough Screentime.
Art: 9
This is Madhouse that i am talking about, Madhouse is Mostly known for it's dam good Animation and that is yet Again shown here.
the art-style is pretty much like a Comic book artstyle with very Detailed and Fluid Animations that made the Action of the Show only stand out much more.
Heck it was so good that ppl thought that the show had a movie Budget, so ppl of madhouse had to say to the public that the show just had Regular Funding like any other show has!
but ofcourse that is also thanks to the Manga which was also VERY detailed and well Drawn.
the Sound: 7
I am not a big expert on Sound.
The sound really fitted the show.
The Opening clearly screamed ACTION COMEDY, while the ending was Relaxing like it was suposed to calm you down after an intense adrenaline rush.
overall: 8
One punch man is a series that is not Compelling, Complicated, Emotional or Gripping show.
Opman is a show that is just pure FUN and is nothing more than just entertainment. and like many others I enjoyed the hell out of it! (Enjoyment is a solid 9!)

                I don't usually enjoy shows as much as I enjoyed OPM. That said, is it really worth the watch?
On one hand, One Punch Man has a rather predictable story that you could probably figure out after watching about half the episodes. The ending was really incomplete and unsatisfying, and some of the characters were REALLY shallow and trope-y. The shallowness of the characters is really accentuated by how much monologue-ing Saitama does. It's pathetic.
On the other hand, One Punch Man is a masterpiece of its time. While it has its issues, it has amazing art, sound, and action - the way they manage to make
                  every fight exciting makes it an easy show for me to recommend. Not only that, but when this show is funny, it's HILARIOUS. Unlike some shows, it manages to dispense its comedy at the exact right times, and to great effect.
Positive aspects:
1. Action - it's really good. It manages to make every fight scene have heavy impact, even when it shouldn't have had under normal circumstances.
2. Comedy - this show is comedy gold. There are so many memes based off of this that I wouldn't even know where to start explaining.
3. Story - while I did rag on it a bit, the story and atmosphere are actually pretty decent.
Negative aspects:
1. Characters - some of the characters are complete and utter trash. They're there to complete their roles in action and comedic sequences, and nothing else. 
2. Ending - while the final action scene was breathtaking, the actual ending felt rushed and nonsensical. Why did this happen? Could it have been explained in some other way than a quick 10 second monologue? 
In short, One Punch Man is an amazing show with great art, sound design, action, and story.

                One Punch Man is a satire/parody of Shounen Anime.
One Punch Man is a good time.
One Punch Man is overhyped.
The show is GREAT FUN, don't get me wrong, it's somewhat deep at a few points. But that's all it'll ever be for me.
So it's only a 8/10 - Hey that ain't a low score alright? 
Story  - 7/10It's laid there and then adds in a structure/order system to add more depth to the show and then it builds on the threat danger on and on.
Art - 8/10
Not a lot of flair in character designs but the action scenes and animation for them are exhilarating, very smooth and nice.
Sound - 7/10
Opening is amazing, full of M-M-MAN POWER! Background OST does well to make the scenes good. But they ain't really memorable for me.
Character - 7/10
Eh they're just interesting, they ain't deep because they add a lot of characters.

                One does not come into One Punch Man expecting a deep philosophical tale a of man trying his hardest to connect his fist with another persons face, one expects whats on the box and they do indeed recieve that. One Punch Man is as ridiculous as its title and premise.
How it achieves this is simple; keep it simple. Saitama is a simple guy living in a city who literally just happens to be a superhero. The plot and events in One Punch Man are executed in such a way they don't seem that surprising, they seem natural; They build upon each other and slowly help
                  build plot for what I believe to be a second season, not hat the current season doesn't have a climax. None of the plots or events are boring and none of their conclusions are boring and they all have an effect on the world as whole, which I like since I don't want plot to not have any effect.
In addition the characters are also affected by the unfolding plot. However One Punch Man suffers from what I like to call 'Harem character syndrome' IE. Too many characters. The problem isn't that they introduce too many but that they introduce a plethora of them towards the later half and don't do much with the latter characters as they do with the former ones. Our main protagonist doesn't truly develop but I wasn't expecting him to but they give him a rather good character build in the beginning of the show.
The art work in One Punch Man is Phenomenal. The character all have more or less the same build but are different and noticeable enough that you could easily tell them apart. The fight scenes are where One Punch Man really shines though. Each one feels different and the stakes always seem very apparent because of how much build up each one gets, some getting more than others because of their premise. Where One Punch Man lacks in art is in its stiller scenes between protagonists because the none fight scenes between protagonists and antagonists are entertaining. The varying art styles give the show an odd charm akin to that of 'Panty and Stocking'.
Furthermore the soundtrack accompanying the artwork is great, making each fight scene more epic and enjoyable. The rest of the soundtrack isn't very memorable since it was for scenes that I felt indifferent about. The OP is one of the greatest I've ever heard and is one of my favourite, though the ED feels wasted and more like something I'd hear in a 'feels' slice-of-life anime. The voice acting is good, nothing awe inspiring but I did find it enjoyable.
Lastly I binged One Punch Man in a single day and still enjoyed I emmensly, its not the greatest anime of all time but in my mind its definatley a contender.
In conclusion, what one would expect to find in One Punch Man is great, action packed, epic anime with great art, good music, fantastic pacing and a rather enjoyable piece of mindless fun.",8,Tshepilepci

                It takes an unbelievable amount of skill to use someone as uninteresting as Saitama as a core concept for one of the most interesting super hero anime on the market.
It takes the absolute piss of both superhero shows and fighting anime by A. cutting out the crap and dissolving the hero system into a do-gooder competition, which it always is... just... decorated, and by B. cutting out all the 'oh i'm not at full power BS' that you get from Dragonball and Fairy Tail by making someone so OP that 1% of his power is 10000% that of the person second to him (although he
                  does take time to travel when he wants to, even though he can run at the speed of sound or something close to that).
The story is pretty standard (heroes fight threats etc), but you will find that you're more interested in what Saitama is doing... which is often nothing (meanwhile, the world is in danger).
Looking forward to season two in 2017
Art and sound wise, i would say its all top notch. When i say that, i mean its something that i will remember. On numerous occasions, they have managed to completely beef out a scene to the point where, a typical scene can be made into something bad-ass. Also, there is a lot of attention to physics when Saitama punches someone, which really adds the the comedy of it all.
Characters are what this anime is made for, Saitama is forever going to be on the internet's walk of fame. This guy is on par with Gin (Gintama) when it comes to pulling faces.
Mash this all into a pot and cook for 25 minutes per episode and you have something that anyone should watch. It will make you laugh out loud.
This also gets my seal of approval for anime intros. Very good, even though i'm not into the heavy guitar and, at times, rockish theme.",10,LackOfARealLife

                First half of the series where it focused on Saitama (aka. One Punch Man) was unique and entertaining to say the least, enough to recommend it to the non-otakus out there. However once the unessential characters (everyone else except Saitama) started having longer screen times then it felt forced. It's like the writer/s wanted to give the uninteresting extras their own backstory or something.
I appreciated the satire of monsters wanting to eradicate all of humanity for no apparent reason with the uninterested bald hero destroying them effortlessly. Satire are a dime a dozen and they should have stuck to their guns instead of going generic

                The story was excellent. It was a villain of the week show that follows a ridiculously over-powered protagonist, and it admits it. However, the concept that the hero will be able to beat what ever the threat is in a single punch is horrible to the shows suspense. Every cliff hanger is completely flat, because the capped-baldy will just show up and end it in a single punch.
Art and Sound are not only amazing but orgasmicly good deserving of perfect scores. The show keeps a levity about it in the way it often depicts the protagonist in a simplistic manner; but I had one problem
                  with the art, and that was that this mook-style Saitama also shows up at some of the worst times and just ruins the mood.
The characters were dynamic enough but there were too many introduced all at once in the last episodes that I lost track of many of there personalities. The Villains of the week were all fabulous for what time they had on screen, though their motivations were very flat, ""Rawr we're better than humans and want to kill/enslave all of them."" The only exception was the final villain who was just bored and looking for a fight to entertain their selves with. 
The protagonists that were around long enough to for me to attach to had either well written backstories or personality quirks that made me like them, but a lot (like a lot a lot) of characters fell flat; maybe because they just didn't get the screen time they deserved.
As per my enjoyment: In compiling my list of anime, I've learned that I'm not much partial to fighting anime as much as I once believed. While the show  executes every other aspect very well, I simple didn't enjoy it. The anime is very well produced, but it's for someone with different tastes than my own.",7,DoudechaChromata

                I'm going to make this as quick and simple as I can without spoiling anything... p.s. MC - main character
Story (6) - Story is very straight forward, MC is an incredibly over powered hero who is able to defeat any of his opponents in one punch. The story follows him as he tries to find a worthy opponent for him to battle (one that won't die in one punch). The story isn't what carries this anime but rather the amount of humor and characters that is introduced within it.
Art (9) -  If theres something this series should be known for its the near perfect
                  art and animation within in. Every action/fight scene within this series is pure epic-ness as every movement down to the pivot of the foot is very fluent and nice to look at. The art in this series could even put some anime movies to shame.
Sound (8) - Voice acting in this is great, especially the MC (Saitama) who is able add his much needed bleakness to dialogue which can make every encounter somewhat humorous. The music in this series is also very epic and heroic, every time the opening song played I could feel myself wanting to get up off of my chair and just fight someone.
Character (8) - Every character in this series adds to the humor that befalls the MC. Every character is very likeable and much needed detail is put in to them which makes every character (even the background citizens) look somewhat individually unique or important.
Enjoyment (10) - I think I found this to be the most enjoyable anime series I have watched to date. Every episode made me laugh and every episode left me wanting for more. This series doesn't takes itself too seriously which makes it hard not to like it as there are just so many enjoyable elements in this which are hard to criticise as you don't know if it actually is trying to be funny or just make fun of itself.
Overall (9) - One of my favourite series to date and I think that anyone can enjoy this, whether their looking for a laugh or whether they just want to see some nice action scenes. Definitely should check this one out if you haven't already.",9,3mantheGman

                no major things wrong with it the story is fun and entertaining the backrounds are huge our main guy is so op and the anime uses this to its advantage very well. the world feels huge with all kinds of fun wacky characters including but not limited to a guy on a bike with the mentality of superman, a guy who rips his clothes off to fight, a guy who to get out of working for a living atempts to overthrow the goverment to get money for people who dont wana work and man many others. the main character is devoid of emotion and insted
                  is defined by his hilarious deadpan interactions with his oponents even telling them to stfu when they start to talk about there plans overlong before punching them to death most times looking verry board and giving not one fuck.

                I just thought this anime was freaking hilarious even if it was the same joke over and over again. It always happened in a way that caught you off guard or left you in suspense somehow even though the outcome was obvious. takes real skill to do that. A simple person will love this show because it really isn't complicated at all. Even though the title explains it all surprise is still inside, like its a cereal box. Not to forget, the opening will prepare you for the climax of every episode which is why i put the story as pretty weak.

                Doesn't do justice to the manga at all. Misses the points of the manga that go beyond ""Saitama is broken strong, mmmkay?"". Barely does any of the more subtle undertones which give its real value to the OPM manga and it's a whole lot of flash and barely half of the original material.
It's visually impressive and the music certainly does a great job too,  there's lots of nice scenes but for all the nice things to look at I still felt like it was just a ""saitama is strong"" anime with a ton of loud clear-cut parody of manga tropes, rather than the clever
                  and very subtle parody that goes along with the loud and obvious parody that can both be found in the manga.

                The excellent animation quality and occasional comedic gag do little to change the fact that One Punch Man is an anime that is intended for an audience that simply doesn’t include me. This isn’t so much a fault of the anime, I do not enjoy “over-the-top” action series. The running joke behind the series had over stayed its welcome well before the 12th episode finished and sadly that is really all this story had to offer. 
Is OPM suppose to be taken seriously? Is it suppose to be laughed at? It’s like trying to peel an onion and is ultimately a futile question as I

Well it was nice and I get the hype.
But ugh...it sux when you know that Saitama will win every time *eyeroll* it kinda gets totally meaningles to watch. 
I was fun and enjoyable, but also totally void of any good action. Well yeah, there were fights, but...you can only enjoy the graphic of it and wait for Saitama to deliver his punch >>""
Something comes. Unimportant characters die. Important characters do not. end. (also...did the gay guy say he is a serial rapist? >> is that funny? why would anyone want to fight along with him?)
Also...Saitama is so unhappy on the beggining to kill everyone
                  with only one punch and at the end he gets to fight with someone he does not kill with one punch. I wanted him to be at least little happy and enjoy it. but he is just too boring even for that. That little thing annoyed me so much. ugh.
overall I enoyed it, but nothing to write home about. Probably should have watchet it with more open mind or something? But too bad. imma pms-ing :P

                Superman, the superhero persona of Clark Kent, is a superhero known for his constant display of strong moral values, strength beyond that of all other superheroes and supervillains, being the ultimate superhero and above all else what he is best known for is not being the hero for justice everyone wishes they will become, no, he is best known FOR BEING FUCKING BORING!
Superheroes were always creations of their time, made to relate or satisfy a certain mentality or niche aspect of the population. As they've become more prevalent as time went on, they're a lot more varied, but Superman is seen as the daddy of
                  superheroes, the current biggest icon.
The best niche One Punch Man fits is that where people understand how the strongest biggest most morally correct person is boring. Saitama, is also that character in their super hero universe that is the strongest character you will encounter hence he will be the one to solve the problem. But his strength is not represented in a positive light. In fact, Saitama himself iterates that being the strongest, is boring. He is represented as yearning for a challenge to bring his full potential, as someone who is complacent at best about where he is in life, living a very mundane and unfullfilling life. Due to what  his entire life became boring, and he feels unchallenged.
But since he's the strongest hero, it's obvious that every other character is gonna see him as the solution, the biggest most badass hero? No. The vast majority of people see him as a nobody. He looks unintimidating, his design doesn't really make him stand out and he's not a particularly imposing person. He's not the representation of the most manly man on earth. He's just there, a guy. Due to that, everyone is mislead to believe that he is irrelevant and that has caused all of his achievements to be appropriated to other people and any action to be disregarded, because, he just doesn't fit your expectations of the strongest person once you see him.
Saitama is in a place in life that he constantly yearns for a challenge, and just lives, despite all odds, a normal life, if you look at his self described hobby, battling gigantic monsters, as just that, a hobby. There's nothing particularly interesting about him as a person. The most interesting thing about this character is that he seems to fit in as an anticharacter. He's the representation of what everyone thinks of the most average characteristics of a superhero. Straight up boredom.
He's the hook I got from the series. It wasn't the constant joke of ""yo one punch haha so funny battle win fast free exp"". It was not the visuals. It was the active choice of creating a boring superhero and using that for entertainment.
By describing Saitama, I've just described the story. The story is about how Saitama yearns for a challenge, his waiting of it. On the road, themes of heroism will come through, such as characters with no actual strength trying their best, not because of power or fame, but because if they won't, nobody else will. And on the road, the hierarchy of superheroes and popularity of said superheroes will be criticized, as the society is centered around it and as all superheroes do it for fame and popularity, without caring much about heroism itself. I don't see One Punch Man as just a comedy, but as a really strong representation of a superhero who reached a peak above everyone else's. You can look at it as a parallel to the Justice League or all around superhero mediums, where the most popular superheroes despite their strength, get the spotlight because they sell and people buy into them.
In terms of action, the fights aren't particularly interesting as they are all based on sheer strength, and well... we all know what's up when he have a guy of who's premise is that they can punch anything and win. But the fights serve a purpose. The fights serve the purpose of giving us means to learn more about the characters. Constantly developing more characteristics through each fight, even if you & I know what's up, like most superhero action set pieces, it's about admiring the core of the superheroes and their fiber. And the fights are great means of setting all of that up.
Most of the other characters add to the general theme or add some parallels to the main character. They're not really there to shine on their own. I mean, I enjoy some of them to a great level, but Saitama is the one that carries the show. And all of the other characters in the show, are there to complete Saitama. They're all in a supporting role. And that is not a bad thing. As the show does a great job focusing on a central character really really well and with a strong core, the support of the core should be just as solid.
The art and sound direction was solid, but this is nothing that anyone else has not said before. The art has a great level of detail, the motion is fluid, there's not really any detail that looks clunky, it feels impactful, it's well saturated and the colors blend together well. It is a great looking anime. And it sets up very good looking action scenes. As I've said previously, the fights aren't particularly interesting and they tell a story. But if it's just the animation of the fights that draws you in, that One Punch Man has plenty of. As far as sound goes, everything fits well. It does its job and it manages to get you hyped up. But I didn't find something particularly outstanding to note there. It's still solid, regardless.
One Punch Man is a good choice for you if you think you'd enjoy a series that kinda does deconstruct the superhero genre, but the only reason One Punch Man is simply just good, is because that's pretty much the only way you can interact with it. The niche of One Punch Man is that of giving life of the aspects created out of the superhero genres over the lifetime of this concept. It's very unlikely not to like this series if you have an at least basic understanding of superheroes and what attracts and detracts from them. But I doubt there's people who will see the appeal of the series without this gateway of knowing and seeing the appeal of superheroes. Because they can go on and say, hey, Saitama is fucking boring. And you're completely right, he totally is boring. Doesn't mean he will bore YOU, though.  One Punch Man is a good deconstruction on superheroes. Nothing more. Nothing less.",7,ItIsIDio

                Yay. The last anime to watch in 2015. I heard a lot of people talking about it so I decided to give myself a watch and after watching it, all I gotta say is...I enjoyed it. It was badass and so funny with some awesome action scenes.
One Punch Man doesn’t try to be funny. It simply is. Its humor is more original than a panty flip or a smack over the head with a convenient fan, and it starts from the moment you see the first alien cross your screen. If you’ve ever seen a fighting anime, then you’ve seen Dragon Ball Z. There are
                  so many funny moments I can remember and I laughed bad about it. Music was okay but my favorite one was its opening. Man I loved it. What makes One-Punch Man so effective is how its premise turns the most common Shounen trope on its head. Instead of struggling to become the best in the world,  salaryman-turned-superhero Saitama struggles to find a worthy opponent in battle. The animation quality is solid, and I appreciate how Saitama's eye shape changes depending on how a fight was going. If he's serious, they're drawn in sharp detail and with intensity. If he's bored, they're funny little wedges that make him look spacey. It's a smart way to communicate whether or not the audience should be worried about One-Punch Man (and Japan's) safety.
Despite its awesomeness, it has some flaws. One is that since it's an action-parody anime, the first half was alright but the second half suddenly shifted into serious mood which really baffled me a bit. Villains? Unintersting especially the final boss. Some characters don't interact with Saitama at all, maybe one or twice like that green haired chick. And it seems to me that in each and every episode, it's following the Dragon Ball Z formula.
Overall despite its flaws, this anime has great action, lots of laughs and solid animation quality. I enjoyed it a lot :)",8,Zahir456

                Main Takeaway: If you are a lover bad-ass anime and OPs, you will love One-Punch Man. 100%!
Story (8):
There really isn't much of a story. If you need something with character development, or twists, anything that moves a character along, I wouldn't say One Punch Man could give you that. Each episode is more of ""a day in the life of"" the main character (Saitama). I still thoroughly enjoyed each episode because each episode is filled with great comedy, action scenes, and even the introduction of more characters. If I were to look at all of OPM full circle, there wasn't any defining turn in the
                  plot throughout the entire series. 
Art/Sound (10):
Holy EFF. The animation in this series is INSANE. There were so many episodes I have re-watched countless types to just try and re-register the amount of effing awesomeness in my brain. Sound effects, on POINT. The intro, also hypes you up! Man, I'd definitely say my most favorite part of the entire series is the art/sound. It's also hilarious to watch these crazy detailed scenes flip the switch and go simple for the random gags throughout the series. Comedic timing was flawless. 1 minute your heart is racing and the next minute your laughing.
Characters (10):
What really stands out to me in a character is the effortless way I can enjoy everything about them. Saitama (main protagonist) is such a simple-minded guy. To the point that it's admirable. He's not over-dramatic, under-whelming. He's just an ordinary guy (personality-wise) with random quirks that make you bust out laughing. The strongest man in the entire world, so care-free and stresses over the most random things (like video-games and killing a mosquito). On top of having an awesome personality, every single character in OPM has amazing design. From all the villains to (my personal favorite) side-kick Genos. There was so much creativity and detail put into each character, you can't help but feel like this is a masterpiece.
OVERALL/ENJOYMENT (10):
I've had friends who have said ""I can't really get into OPM, nothing really happens"". That's pretty true. Small things happen here and there. But if you are a fan of bad-ass action, OP main characters, and sick animations/character designs, you wouldn't mind so much the story. I could honestly watch 100 episodes of OPM of nothing happening but well-timed gags, awesome characters, unforgettable fight scenes. I absolutely loved it. One of my all time favorites. You can tell whether or not it's for you within the first 3 episodes. Check it out!",10,Mobdoe

                After watching all 12 episodes of this anime here is my review of it (my opinion)
sorry for my bad English I tried translating most of it from Japanese :)
*WARNING POTENTIAL SPOILERS: you have been warned* 
Well now on with the review. After watching One Punch Man i realized that it's name clearly stated the obvious. ""A man"" that apparently gained some super power that gives him enormous strength by doing one thing. ""TRAINING and thinking about about being a hero"", knowing this was the story behind our protagonist Saitama ""Thee one punch man"" it greatly disapointed me i just want him to at least to
                  have a decent story but he did not, seriously ruined it for me I give it the story a 6/10. The Art was outstanding i absolutely love the art it reminded me so much of DBZ i give the art a 10/10. The sound quality and the characters were great as well though most of that sounds were a bit overused i still enjoyed it other wise, character design was great again reminded me of DBZ i give the sound and character a 9/10. Sadly the enjoyment for me while watching Saitama bust holes in bodies and obliterate his enemies into a bunch of pieces over and over made feel disappointed as well i don't want to ruin it for anybody so i'll just give the enjoyment rating a 5/10.
overall rating 7.8/10

                For all skeptics!! One Punch Man offers a brand new take on all shonen hero tropes and it WORKS. 
Story!! 
The story itself during the anime is very Hunter x Hunter esque - initially episode by episode, very sporadic, with not a lot of explanation as to Why things Are the Way they Are. With the second season I think we'll see more of an overarching plot, but even so, each episode is rich with humour and Saitama's inexplicable strength, and really, that's the core of the series. 
Art!! 
The art is fantastic. Don't let Saitama's plain character design fool you!! The fighting sequences in
                  this anime - and there are a lot of them! - are literally what I live for as an anime fan. They are fluid, demonstrative, exciting, and they drag the audience into the conflict effortlessly. 
Character!! 
This is where One Punch Man shines as a shonen series breaking through in a genre dominated by One Piece and leftover echoes of Naruto and Bleach. Seitama is actually such a human - he's lazy, irresponsible, negligent - and the glory of the series is that we get to SKIP the Training Arc to the point where he's already so insanely damn strong that he's BORED. Only the thing is, no one realizes that he's powerful, and therefore he's drastically overlooked by the Hero Association and the public. 
This makes for a lot of built up tension - when is he going to meet his match? When is he going to be properly recognized? - and excitement, because we get to see asshole characters put in their place by this crazily strong, relatable bald guy who just wants to make the next sale at the supermarket. 
The secondary characters are mainly tropes, but in no way do they take away from the wonder of Saitama. They aren't at all exhausting or boring, they all add to the flow of the story/fight scenes/humour. 
Overall! 
I recommend to fans of humour, shonen, who aren't looking for anything too serious but who want something with a renewed take on character archetypes.",9,dumbdaisies

                One Punch Man , after hyping up viewers for months before its first episode and wowing them through the next twelve weeks, seems to have effectively stolen the attention of the community at-large.   Most have crowned it as one of the best anime ever, with few dissenters attempting to trudge their way through the massive, raving fanbase.
Before anyone can even begin to search for the merits of One Punch Man as an action-parody, the stellar animation and sound immediately grab the viewer's attention.  For one, the art and animation stand to impress the viewers at every turn and during every fight. 
                  Easily standing out as the strongest overall aspect of One Punch Man, the animation rarely has a subpar moment, allowing the viewers to focus on the anime's storytelling aspects as opposed to becoming distracted by poorly-flowing cuts.  Likewise, the sound, although not nearly as stellar as the animation of One Punch Man, does more than enough to hold up under the massive scrutiny that a mediocre soundtrack would receive.  The production aspects of One Punch Man, at the very least, make it well-deserving of high praise throughout the fandom.
However, once one moves past the excellent art and sound of One Punch Man,  they can begin to focus in on its other story-telling aspects.  And, unfortunately, its inability to properly maintain the role of an action-parody detracts significantly from OPM's potential to be the 'greatest anime of all time'.
As a self-proclaimed action-parody of the action genre itself, One Punch Man sets itself up to the standards that any parody must obtain.  Mainly, these include poking fun at the standard tropes of the subject, making them comical, and  keeping it interesting.  And, for a time, One Punch Man did just that.  The opening episodes clearly stuck true to its word, in that they were a very passable, somewhat funny, parody of all those standard action/shonen anime that we've all probably seen dozens of times.  Saitama's mundane desires to shop at the local supermarket to obtain the sales starkly contrasted  the standard villainy of the early-episode antagonists, and his actions as a 'hero just for fun' wiped out all the expectations that one normally comes to expect out of a hero's ambitions.  
However, as the series progressed, more and more it left that standard nature of parodies behind.  Saitama's mundane wishes flew out the window, and in through the very same window came all the seriousness of any other standard action anime.  One Punch Man had, essentially, dumped all of its efforts to become a great action-comedy and had simply morphed into a just an action anime.  The villains remained stereotypical caricatures as they had been since the very beginning, but Saitama and his contrast to the norms of standard action tropes had changed.  By the last episodes of its run, One Punch Man had ceased being a parody at all, and in fact seemed to have practically given up all attempts to remain a parody.  In the course of its runtime, viewers saw One Punch Man change from the good-to-great action-parody that it had started as to a straight-action anime which played all the action tropes as straight as a line.  Over time, it fell into the trap of all the action shows that it was a parody of, essentially transforming into the standard hype-fueled action anime that it itself had been conceived to poke fun at.  
One Punch Man had the ability to become a great action-parody series.  It had all the pieces in place during the first few episodes (even despite a blatant repetition of its main jokes).  But then it squandered them.  
The hype may have been with One Punch Man, but unfortunately the hype cannot hold up its blatant failures as a parody.",6,Garpachi
30276,"
                I think I can count on my two hands how many reviews don't have One Punch Man rated as a ten (at the time of writing this review, anyways).
One Punch Man, airing in the Fall 2015 season, directed by Shingo Natsume of Space Dandy fame, and headed by the ever fantastic Studio Madhouse. The show follows Saitama, a self-proclaimed ""hero for fun"" who can, well, kill all enemies with one punch. 
I didn't really go into this series expecting much other than cool fights and a funny parody of the shounen genre, and for the most part, I got what I wanted. The action certainly
                  is a marvel to look at, utilizing great depth of field, interesting camera angles, zooming shots and harsh lines to create visceral shots of pure excitement. There isn't a bad looking fight here, and on that front, I didn't leave dissapointed.
However, I felt the parody aspect got weaker and weaker as the show progressed. It worked a lot better earlier in the series when it matched the more lighter, fun tone, but as the series got more serious, the parody lost a lot of it's steam. Even though the fight scenes were still top notch, they just weren't as fun because of this tonal shift. I couldn't accept the lack of tension in the fight scenes as I did earlier because the comedy was nonexistent during these later episodes except for the inbetween moments before and after fights, and, to me, it started showing signs of the type of show it was trying to parody. The comedy was so funny in the first half or so that I was really missing it throughout the second half of the show. 
That being said, there are a couple of interesting themes portrayed in One Punch Man that I truly didn't expect a show like this. Stuff like society's over-reliance on numerical rankings elevated this show from a straight parody. Themes like this were the bright spot during the more serious second half, and even though they were a nice surprise, I wish the comedy was balanced a lot more with those themes to satisfy both sides of the proverbial coin. 
Saitama is a fun enough lead, especially in the early episodes. He's certainly a great way of parodying the battle shounen genre. Even with his character design, for example. As opposed to spiky hair like literally all battle shounen protagonists, he's completely bald, which, along with his facial expressions,   is a nice way to complement the parody it was going for. Also, Pairing him with incredibly serious Genos adds a nice dynamic to both their characters. Overall, a very solid fit for a series of this stature.
The two most focused side characters, Sonic and Mumen Rider, were decent additions as well. Mumen Rider in particular was also a bright spot in the latter half of the episodes, with his selfless and headstrong personality. The rest of the characters of the bureau really need a second season to be fully realized. Of course, Madhouse has a reputation for not having more than 1 season of, well, anything (come on now Madhouse, Btooom! literally ended in the middle of the story, you gotta complete it!). The large variety of these characters did help them a lot, because a lot of them were just random stereotypes. I get that that's kind of the point, but if there were fewer of these characters, this fact would be way too noticeable, so I'm thankful for that.
Oh, I guess I can't really review this show without talking about the opening. It's pretty hype. There. I talked about it.
Overall, even though the second half of the show wasn't nearly as enjoyable as the first, the overall product is still worth the watch. The shift in tone would have been a lot more welcome had it figured out a way to keep interspercing comedy to keep it fresh, as the comedy was one of the best parts about this show.  Even then, the action does help accommodate for this, even though the serious tone makes the lack of tension less bearable. Could've been better, but could've also been way worse.",7,TokyoSanchez

                One Punch Man.  The anime community seems to make this show quite the polarizing one.  On one side, people are worshiping and loving the ever loving crap out of this anime, while others hate it and despise its existence.  Some people think that it is just overrated.  What's my take on it?
Personally, I found One Punch Man a blast to watch, but there are some definite flaws with it.  For some reason, I feel like going over the bad parts first, instead of starting off well.
Cons:
-Lack of deep characterization: Saitama is great, but none of the main or side characters
                  are not developed well. Many characters are introduced and the viewer can be impressed by their awesome powers, but we do not get a good insight into what makes them tick.
-How far does the anime take the parody? : One Punch Man is a parody of the shounen/superhero anime, but how much does the anime try to embrace its tropes?  Near the end, I felt that the comedy and the sheer stupidity of its plot were reaching a peak where I could not intake the vast quantities and scale of its over the top and exaggerated features.  This also comes from the fact that many characters on the protagonist's team and the main character himself are so overpowered that there is a lack of tension in fights sometimes.
-Mundane, slightly boring moments between action scenes: Sometimes, I found myself a bit bored by the everyday moments of Saitama.  I am normally fine with these types of regular life, but One Punch Man's ones did not appeal to me.
Pros:
Great art: Madhouse produces very consistent and above average art.  The characters look great and the city backgrounds are very nostalgic, reminding me of a superhero city.
Amazing action: The action in One Punch Man is scary good.  When Saitama is not completely destroying people, there can be incredible fight scenes that can fill viewers with passion and fire within their hearts.  These moments will glue people to their screens.  The viewing angles and the style is adrenaline pumping and helps make the action just breathtaking.  Genos and other side characters provide superb visuals for explosions and other powerful attacks.
Great OP: Old-fashioned, purely passionate and powerful song, just makes you want to punch through 15 walls
Good comedy: Saitama's jokes work really well, as he completely destroys the serious tone of certain parts of the anime.  
Overall: 9/10 a great parody of action anime that has godly action scenes, but has comedy and tropes that may get stale",9,SlowAnimeWatcher

                This being my first ever review, let's start with a bang, One Punch Man made quite some waves recently, For a short while on IMDB it was the highest rated TV series ahead of shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones and it still is in the top 5, It has a pretty high rating on myanimelist and other popular anime sites as well, Ratings like these would have you expect a masterpiece, A unique gem!
 It is not. Now... You will probably say, But, but... It is unique because it does not have the same other animes do not have, Never have we
                  seen a hero struggling to find a villain because he is too powerful!
Well...  There is Dr.Slump by Akira Toriyama(Dragon Ball creator) which features Arale who pretty much is a female robot Saitama. And there are plenty of other parody animes too, So not unique in that aspect also.
So now that we established that, What could be the reason for it being so popular and highly rated?
Well lets rate each category without spoiling anything(tho the title of the anime is pretty much a spoiler):
STORY: 5 out of 10 (Mediocre)
It is based on a gag manga, based on a gag web-comic, The whole thing is one big gag, Saitama is too strong and that is funny. The arcs are whatever happens to come in the mind of ONE, They do not seem thought through, They are short and don't make you think too much. Heroes fighting villains, mindless action(not saying that its bad), Has its funny moments, You have a ranking system for both heroes and villains, Kinda like they do in MOBAS.  It is not good, But i cant say its bad either, Depends on the person.
ART: 10 out of 10(Outstanding)
To me One Punch Man is visually one of the most appealing animes, All props to Madhouse, They seem like a passionate bunch and it shows.
There are some amazing action scenes in this one.
SOUND: 8 out of 10(Very good)
I liked the voice actors and i like the soundtrack, There are some sick beats to head bob too, It is uplifting.
Characters: 6 out of 10(fair)
Pretty average, Being honest... Not too attached to any of them, Saitama is likable, But all the others seem really generic and bland, I could not give a toss about them, They do not really make me laugh or do not really incite me
to follow their progress, I am sorry, Pretty boring.
Enjoyment: 7 out of 10(good)
I had a good time watching this anime, It is fun and if you are having fun is all that matters for your time spent to be worth it. 
OVERALL: 7(GOOD)
This anime is okay by my standards, But it did not meet the hype expectations, I am the type of guy to give everything a chance to impress me and while one punch did have its impressive aspects it is also very dull and bland in others as aforementioned.",7,loveandjustlove

                In the same way it only takes one punch for Saitama to defeat his enemies, It only takes this show one episode to masterfully get its point across. The downside to this is that the show will never be able to surprise you. 
The upside to this is that it's *literally the only issue anyone should take with the show.* You're not here for a masterfully-crafted narrative or some deep character arc; you're here to see some of the best shounen character designs go through comically hyperbolic scenarios. 
On the subject of character designs, One Punch Man's characters are so interesting that I could literally
                  watch them do anything and I would still find it entertaining. I could just watch a whole show of Saitama and Genos trying to catch good supermarket deals or clip coupons, or watch supporting cast fool around when they're not doing work for the Hero's association. Some of these side characters could have their own entire story arc on how they pay the bills and I still feel that it wouldn't be boring. Part of the charm of everyone in this show is that their greatest weakness seems to be real-life responsibilities, which only further supports the foundation of humor.
Here's hoping that season 2 is just as silly and irreverent as season 1.",9,Crusader_8

                « Well that was lame... I kinda had my hopes up too. »
This quote is not coming from me ; the one saying it is Saitama himself - OPM's main protagonist and « hero » - after just another one-shot strike on a bad guy.
For One-Punch Man has a very basic main concept, which is pretty much summed up right in the title : Saitama is a normal guy who dreams about becoming a super hero, in a world that's frequently attacked by a plethora of monsters coming in every format and color you can imagine. In order to accomplish that he follows a simple
                  training for some years during which he does push-ups, ab exercises and jogging. He ends up becoming the most powerful man in the world : every opponent he meets is reduced to shreds by just one punch. Worst thing is nobody's aware of Saitama's power and noboby's going to believe that this tiny baldy guy with a blasé face posesses such a power.
There you go ! There's almost nothing else to say, the recipe for each and every OPM episode is already layed out. Like this : bad guy appears >> bad guy knocks everyone out >> bad guy puffs out his chest to show off how strong he is >> bad guy also beats every hero that's trying to stop him >> Saitama pops out of nowhere (or has been slowed down during the whole episode) >> bad guy laughs at Saitama cuz he really looks lame, am I right ? >> Saitama blows a hole into bad guy >> Saitama's f*cking disappointed and goes home.
And so on. During 12 épisodes. And I'm not even exagerating.
I'm not criticizing this particular recipe per se, it should be enough to make a few funny episodes, it's an efficient gag that brought a smile to my face once or twice... but not more really. That's what's shameful about OPN : it really overstays its welcome and is wallowing in its premise without ever risking going out of its comfort zone. So much that at the end of the last episode we're still where we were at the beginning. When you announce something as big as « hey this is our hero and he's stronger than anyone else » at the beginning of a shonen anime, you should at least try to shake our certainties as viewers. If you don't, all that's left is one running-gag that's already annoying at the third episode and that doesn't get better as time passes.
Now people will come and tell me that not EVERYTHING revolves around Saitama, that there're parallel plots evolving, other heroes fighting against overpowered beasts (like when Geno starts to fight before Saitama does, or when everyone get beat up against the Sea King, or when the heroes unite against the self-regenerating alien...). Okay. But come on, the strings are so transparent and obvious that it is impossible not to understand that every time everything is made to make us feel that everything is hopeless until Saitama arrives. Therefore the only perceivable stake of the episode is related to the circumstances that will keep mister One-Punch from getting into the ring and ending the tension. But what tension really ? Certainly not the stress of not knowing the outcome of the fight since Saitama is already assured to win. And certainly not the survival of the fragile supporting cast since none of these guys is engaging or relatable. Seriously, I did not relate to any of those shallow multicolored imbeciles (same thing with Saitama by the way), whose personalities are poorly wrote - except maybe from the bicylcle guy whose name I keep forgetting and that offers probably the only touching moment of the whole story. None of those f*ckers is developped beyond their gimmicks. These guys reminded me of the One-Piece character zoo, except that at least Eichiro Oda has the talent to breathe life and passion into those weird and deformed characters. While OPN ends up just throwing them onto the screen to make us admire their caricature. 
One could also say to me : « Relax Max ! It's just a parody ! It's anti-shonen, it inverts the genre and plays with its tropes. It's ironic, it's satirical, it's supposed to be coarse and vulgar ». No it's not supposed to be. When you build a 12 episodes show, when you engage into a narrative, then you have to take on and assume what it implies about how you'll polish every piece of the anime. If you don't then just make a short film or even a video, it would've been largely enough to contain the whole point of One-Punch Man. As soon as the creators make the choice to extend their idea to several episodes, they owe it to themselves (and to us) to offer a product with a certain level of quality, that reinvents itself, that keeps the audience interested, involved, to at least try to set some stakes.
Yet in OPN, there's almost no plot (well there're some plot elements that remain obscure, like what Metal Knight is plotting, or the true identity of the mysterious Blast, but we'll only be able to judge when season 2 arrives). At the end of the last episode Saitama is still far from having found anything to awake him, the characters are all shite due to their one-dimensional personality, the rythm is slow (especially the first three episodes, which is a shame really because those three episodes are boring but they already used all the jokes of the serie, so when the show wakes up a little bit in episode 4 it's already too late and we're as blasé as Saitama himself).
The animation thankfully is gorgeous and produce some mildly-entertaining scenes, and that's the reason why this anime doesn't get a 3.
In fact, now that I think about it, One-Punch Man is exactly like if we were shown a war between two armies of ants fiercly battling against each other... until a human shows up and steps calmly on the pile of insects. Ok, why not, but then we spectators should be put in the point of view of an ant, so that we could be genuinely surprised when the deus ex machina happens. But here there's no surprise occurring since we're warned from the beginning : Saitama defeats everyone with one punch. We're placed under the human's point of view and we're passively waiting for his shiny red boot to crush the swarming mass of insects. And boredom to show his pointy nose as soon as we realise that the creators will NEVER grow tired of their single running-gag. *whispers*
But hey, believe me or not I'm an optimist and I will try to watch season 2. It nothing else at least to see up to where is the anime capable of get stuck in total stagnation before waking up and - who knows! - maybe to turn around its own tropes rather than focusing so hard in parodying weakly those of its glorious elders.
French version :
« Well that was lame... I kinda had my hopes up too. »
Cette citation n'est pas de moi, c'est Saitama lui-même, principal protagoniste et « héros » de One-Punch Man, qui la prononce après un énième gros vilain dûment tabassé d'un seul coup terrassant.
Car One-Punch Man a un concept de base très simple, qui se retrouve résumé dans son seul titre : Saitama est un type lambda qui rêve de devenir un super-héros, dans un monde régulièrement attaqué par une multitude de monstres de toutes les couleurs et de tous les formats imaginables ; pour cela il s'entraine des années par un régime à base de pompes, abdos et jogging et finit par devenir l'homme le plus fort du monde : tout adversaire qu'il rencontre se voit réduit en charpie par un seul coup de poing. Le drame, c'est que personne n'est au courant, et personne ne veut croire que ce petit bonhomme chauve blasé possède une telle puissance.
Hop, voilà ! Emballé c'est pesé, la recette de chaque épisode de One-Punch Man est toute tracée. Comme suit : méchant débarque >> méchant déboîte tout le monde >> méchant gonfle le torse pour bien montrer comment qu'il est balèze >> méchant dérouille aussi tous les héros qui viennent l'arrêter >> Saitama déboule par hasard (ou a été ralenti pendant tout l'épisode) >> méchant se paye la tronche de Saitama parce qu'il a vraiment l'air tout nul >> Saitama fait trou dans méchant >> Saitama dépité, blasé, rentre chez lui.
Et ainsi de suite pendant 12 épisodes, je caricature à peine.
Cette recette je ne la critique pas en soi, ça donne en théorie de quoi faire quelques épisodes marrants, c'est un gag efficace qui m'aura fait sourire une fois ou deux... mais vraiment pas plus. C'est ce qui est dramatique avec One-Punch Man : elle se complait dans ses prémisses sans jamais avancer hors de sa zone de confort, si bien qu'à la fin du dernier épisode, on est toujours pas plus avancé. Quand on annonce quelque chose d'aussi gros que « voici notre héros, il est plus fort que tout le monde » et qu'on suit un arc narratif de shonen, on se doit de mettre à mal nos certitudes. Sinon tout ce qu'il reste est un running-gag qui est déjà lourdingue au bout de 3 épisodes et qui ne s'arrange pas à mesure que le temps passe.
Alors on me dira que tout ne tourne pas autour de Saitama, que des intrigues annexes se forment, qu'il y a d'autres héros qui eux mènent de véritables combats contre des bestioles surpuissantes (cf entre autres lorsque Geno commence à se battre avant Saitama, ou lorsque tout le monde se fait rétamer face au Sea King, ou que les héros s'unissent face à l'alien auto-régénérant). Certes, mais les ficelles sont si transparentes qu'il est impossible de ne pas comprendre qu'à chaque fois tout est fait pour nous faire ressentir que tout est sans espoir jusqu'à ce que Saitama débarque. Dès lors le seul enjeu perceptible de l'épisode tient aux circonstances qui empêcheront mister One-Punch de débarquer dans le ring pour mettre fin à la tension. Mais quelle tension vraiment ? Certainement pas celle d'une quelconque issue incertaine du combat puisque Saitama est posé comme gagnant d'avance. Et sûrement pas celle de la survie des frêles personnages secondaires puisque aucun n'est attachant. Sérieusement, je ne me suis attaché à aucun de ces branques bariolés sans profondeur (pas plus qu'à Saitama d'ailleurs), dont le portrait est grossièrement taillé à la hache – à l'exception du cycliste dont le nom m'échappe, auquel j'accorde une belle séquence touchante. Tout ce petit monde m'a un peu fait penser au bestiaire grotesque de One Piece, sauf qu'au moins ce dernier avait le talent de leur insuffler une vie, une passion – fût-elle risible ou simplement débile, tandis que One-Punch Man se contente de les balancer dans l'écran sans autre forme de procès, comme pour nous faire admirer leurs caricatures.
Ah oui, parce qu'on en vient justement à l'autre point qu'on pourrait m'opposer : « Relax mec ! C'est une parodie ! C'est de l'anti-shonen, ça renverse le genre et ça joue avec ses codes! C'est ironique, c'est satirique, c'est normal si c'est grossier ». Non, ça n'est pas normal. Quand on construit un show de 12 épisodes, qu'on pose une narration, alors on se doit d'assumer ce que cela suppose en terme de soin apporté aux diverses portions de l'animé. Sinon on fait un court-métrage ou une simple vidéo, ç'aurait été largement suffisant pour contenir tout l'intérêt de One-Punch Man. Dès lors que la série fait le choix de s'étendre sur la durée, elle se doit de proposer quelque chose de qualité, de se renouveler, de maintenir l'intérêt de l'audience, de convoquer un minimum d'enjeux.
Or ici le scénario est quasi-inexistant (il reste éventuellement les éléments obscurs comme ce que complote Metal Knight, ou l'identité du mystérieux Blast restée en suspens, mais on ne sera libre d'en juger que lors de la prochaine saison donc ça ne rentre pas vraiment en ligne de compte) ne serait-ce que parce que Saitama à la fin du dernier épisode est toujours loin d'avoir trouvé de quoi se dérider, les personnages sont à chier puisque unidimensionnels et ne s'extraient jamais de leur caricature, le rythme est mollasson (tout particulièrement au début de l'animé, et c'est dramatique : les trois premiers épisodes sont chiants, mais suffisent à eux-seuls à épuiser toutes les maigres cartouches humoristiques de l'animé, si bien que lorsque ça se réveille un peu vers l'épisode 4 il est déjà trop tard : on est aussi blasé que Saitama). L'animation heureusement réserve quelques scènes d'action sympathiques, qui permettent de rendre cette baudruche d'animé passablement divertissant (ce pourquoi il arrive tout de même à 4).
En fait, c'est exactement comme si on nous montrait une guerre entre deux armées de fourmis, qui se battent férocement jusqu'à ce qu'un humain débarque et écrase tranquillement le tas d'insectes avec son pied. Pourquoi pas, mais alors qu'on nous place, nous spectateurs, sous le point de vue de ces fourmis, de telle sorte qu'on puisse être authentiquement saisis lorsque le deus ex machina se produit. Mais ici nulle surprise, puisqu'on est averti dès le départ : Saitama défait n'importe quel opposant d'un seul coup. On a le point de vue de l'humain et on attend passivement que sa bottine rouge écrase sans passion la masse grouillante des formicidés. Et l'ennui de poindre le bout de son petit nez dès lors qu'on réalise que les créateurs ne se lasseront jamais de leur running-gag. Soupir
Mais Dieu m'en soit témoin, je regarderai la saison 2, ne serait-ce que pour voir jusqu'à quel point One-Punch Man est capable de s'embourber dans le plus total immobilisme avant de se réveiller et, qui sait, prendre à revers ses propres codes au lieu de se concentrer si fort à parodier bien faiblement ceux de ses plus glorieux aînés.",4,T-Wazoo

                So I just finished watching this and I'd like to know what all the hype was about?
Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad show. In fact if you want something that you can watch that's full of action and you don't really have to think, then this is the show for you. But if you've watched DBZ, One Piece or any of the other super powerful main character shonen out there, then you could probably skip this.
Other than the odd funny moment the characters are what you expect from this type of show and having having grown up watching the big 3, I've seen
                  enough to know this is nothing new.
The things that did stand out and that I thought were great were the art and sound track. The fight scenes are very fluid and flashy and easily some of the best I've seen in a while. And the sound track suits the show perfectly.
So would I recommend it? Meh maybe just so you can say you've seen it and can give your own opinion on it",4,Pandareaper

                Wow!  There sure are a lot of people trying to over sell this anime.
Listen... I agree it's a lot of fun to watch and follow along.  It is not serious and it has some great comedic scenes.  BUT - let's not get in over our heads here by giving it a 10 or calling it the greatest anime since sliced bread.
The Story really is just ""fair"".  They could have taken this anime in so many other directions but it's good enough.  Yes it has some boring times along the way and that's why I don't rate this category any higher.
                   There's some odd issues too - like how was he bleeding in the early episode but not later on?  
The Art... is great!  I really thought the fight scenes were spectacular.  The contrast of the main character's simplistic look vs every other character was awesome.  
The Sound was palatable. 
Character was very good but seriously goofy at times too.  Another reason I would not push this anime past the Very Good rating I gave it.
Enjoyment is definitely there.  It's like watching a classic western.  No real deep thinking involved - just purely entertaining. 
Overall it's a fun anime to watch.  I might watch an episode or 2 again but probably not.

                One punch man reminds me some of those successful hollywood action movies: visually stunning, exciting actions, good humor, one dimensional not-sophisticated but likeable character, predictable storyline, very enjoyable but not memorable. I enjoy watching these. But the highest score I'd give to this type would be 8. On top of these, I felt the first a few episodes were slow and repetitive.

Overall 7/10. I enjoyed the show and won't mind watch it again. But would go out of my way to do that. With a tighter story at the beginning, it will be an 8

                I started watching this show a long time ago and it was one of the first animes i had watched back then. I watched a few episodes before forgetting about it completely and started watching other stuff. I came back to it recently and well... Enjoyed the hell out of it! This show had a bunch of nice comedy and action with 8/8 great animation, (here are the ratings for of all of it btw)  Story:7   Art/Animation:10

                  very well to the character itself. One of my favorite things in this show is that when it want's you to laugh it makes you laugh and when it wants you to tear up... It makes you tear up. (Godammit mumen rider why you gotta be so brave) i DO think that i could be better if not every single one in the hero association underestimated Saitama like they did. It got kind of annoying. I also think that they could improve boros character.

                This is my first review. While OPM certainly has its own flaws and is not perfect, it doesn't stop it from becoming a very good anime that deserves its hype and popularity. 
Starting off with OPM's plot. OPM has a very simple plot that is about a man named Saitama who is so strong that he can defeat his opponents in one punch. As a result, Saitama feels bored and constantly looks for new opponents to fight. While many other animes shy away from very OP characters, OPM does the exact opposite. The enjoyment of OPM isn't to watch the MC Saitama struggle and grow
                  in strength and determination throughout the anime. The enjoyment of OPM is that we get to follow his journey to find new opponents to fight while being doubted my the public as a fake because of his looks and that he is a ""C class"" hero. We really get to see Saitama struggle with getting public recognition for all the good that he has done, and other characters who start to understand Saitama as a person. One thing about this plot is that it does get a little repetitive and predictable as it becomes as simple as: bad guy shows up, ""heroes"" show up, ""heroes"" fail to defeat bad guy, Saitama shows up, Saitama defeats bad guy in one punch. 
The animation of OPM is great. The fighting scenes were extremely well done. Two of my favorite fighting scenes were Saitama vs Genos and Saitama vs Boros. The action scenes are really tense and exiting and they give you a feeling that you are physically there watching the battles unfold. The music was awesome. The opening theme is very catchy, has fast paced animation to go along with it and gives you a preview of the badass MC named Saitama. A lot of the battle music is great as well. In action anime, music can be used to hype up or intensify fight scenes and in OPM it certainly did. I did not like the ending theme as much as the opening, but it contrasts the opening very well. While the opening was really intense and fast paced, the ending theme was more relaxing and served almost as a cooldown to the intense action in this anime. 
The characters in OPM were very interesting. We got the MC Saitama, who is extremely OP and easygoing. He has very memorable facial expressions and quotes that certainly will make you laugh and love him as a character. Then we got Saitama's disciple, the cyborg Genos. In a different anime, Genos would make be a perfect MC since he has a pretty tragic backstory and is strong but not too strong. In OPM however, Genos serves a different purpose. Genos is quite serious about everything and is determined to get stronger. His serious and cold attitude is a great contrast to Saitama's easygoing personality. In fact, Genos is actually considered a better hero and is well loved by public as opposed to Saitama even though Saitama is clearly stronger. Besides Saitama and Genos there are other heroes in this anime as well. My three favorite heroes were Mumen rider, a bicycle rider who doesn't have any real powers and reflects the ""real life hero"", Puri Puri Prisoner, a buff and tall homosexual hero, and Tatsumaki, who is a petite female esper hero with green hair. My criticism is that the side characters didn't appear more in the story and I really wanted to see them more and get to know about them more. 
Even with the somewhat repetitive plot and lack of screen time for the side characters, I still thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It made me laugh, it made me feel exited and tense, it showed me over the top action scenes and it made me feel attached to this anime and to its characters. This is definitely one of the best action/parody animes that I have ever watched and I would definitely watch the second season or a movie in the future. Thats why I gave it a 9/10.

                So, I just now watched this and I know it's about 5 years too late but I had to write something about it, to be honest going into the show I was super skeptical about the series but after watching it, that went away.
First, the story. I give the story a 8/10 just because it starts off super slow then kinda picks up but, that's also the genius of it. The show isn't trying to be the next Attack on Titan or the next Demon Slayer. It's more of a comedy type of show so you can't take it too seriously. If you're looking for
                  something that's entertaining and comedic, this is the show for you.
Second, the Art style, I actually really like the art style of this show especially how it changes in the fight scenes as well as the mood that Saitama is in. 9/10 for sure.
Third, Sound. 10/10 also I know sound doesn't necessarily mean the soundtrack but the soundtrack is amazing and the sound quality is amazing as well 10/10
Fourth, Character. 10/10 Saitama is probably one of the most funny anime protagonists there is, not to mention he's pretty strong too, that's kinda self explanatory so 10/10
Fifth, Enjoyment, 9/10 for me. This would have been 10/10 but the only reason that it wasn't is because I don't like how the series ends (and yes I know season 2 is out now but i'm not talking about season 2).
Finally, 9/10 overall, would definitely recommend and I hope this review helped!",9,PresidentRaikou

                After watching all the episodes (especially the last one with the awesome fight), I can see why people are talking so much about this anime (and manga) and making A LOT of memes all over the internet. The protagonist has already become someone I view with importance in the anime world (LOL). He is remarkably plain looking and doesn't even have hair, and I'm someone who likes a good-looking main character with neat hair and all becuase if you're going to see a character for the entirety of the show he/she should at least be easy on the eyes. But that means nothing to me
                  anymore. Saitama has drawn me in with his personality. That dopey face of his makes me smile because he couldn't give a care in the world about many things, and at the same time when he takes action he's so ridiculously bad-ass it's crazy and funny how he handles things. I might just get into reading the manga because of this. Always looking forward to see what he will get himself into next.",9,For_Reign

                Warning possible Spoilers
ONE PPPPPPUUUUUUNNNNCCCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!!! and thus the epicness begins
The story focuses on Saitama a random person who's a hero for fun, but unlike any other hero his power is One Punch and he desperately wants a fight that'll last longer than 1 second.
What I absolutely love about the story for this anime is that it is a parody of all the OP MC's and superhero shows and this is what you get which I thought was fantastic after finishing it. 
Seeing the random everyday life of Saitama was funny, entertaining and downright amazing and it was always funny how every enemy he encounters completely underestimate
                  him because of his appearance, but really he would completely destroy you however despite having this power Saitama thinks it is a curse because the battles have become too easy and is desperately looking for an opponent that can withstand his punch.
Not only that you have all the other heroes around him who have their own problems and I thought it was very interesting how the superhero community works in this world and what threats they can take on since each threat is classed from Tiger, Demon, Dragon and God. 
But even though this show was funny it can be very serious at times like when the Sea King tried to take over or when Saitama stopped a Meteorite from hitting the planet and the backlash he got the public the anime really shows you what it means to be a hero and how difficult it can be sometimes.
Now the characters were fantastic Saitama is one of my favourite characters right now because he may look serious with his bland face, but he can be a hectic and really calm guy, there are also a lot of moments where his character absolutely shines because of his reactions and some of the actions he does which just make him such a loveable character.
Then you have Genos another prominent character in the show who is a badass cyborg that wishes to be Saitama's pupil so he can become as strong as he is and Genos is another likeable character mainly because he is honorable and looks up to Saitama, there are even times where she stands up for Saitama because he is the only one who knows that without him the world would've been destroyed.
The other heros are also very interesting because they all have cool abilities or powers that make them stand out even if most of these heroes were shown for one episode and there are a few who stand out like Tatsumaki who has Psychokinesis and despite being a small Tsundere she is badass and  there is also Mumen Rider who is a weaker hero, but is really likeable because he has courage and will fight on till the bitter end because he wants to protect the people.
The Villains in this show are well done too even if they were around for one episode they can range from being hilarious to ferocious because some villains like the Sea King almost annihilated a group of heroes until Saitama showed up and then there is Sonic who is a powerful ninja, but has a very sly personality which makes him pretty likeable.
The artstyle was great the detail on the characters and the battles that happened were goddamn amazing and unforgettable and I loved some of the faces that the characters made especially Saitama's faces. I have to give credit to the soundtrack because it is badass and is the exact kind of music you want for an epic battle plus the opening was powerful as hell it absolutely depicts the hero Saitama is.
I loved the action in this show the battles which most of the time lasted a few seconds were really good and the final battle was just on Epic proportions and is something I won't be forgetting at all. The comedy was Golden whenever something went right or wrong for Saitama it was just hilarious and made the show even better.
If you're a superhero fan then this is pretty much a must watch because you will get one Awesome, unforgettable ride and I cannot wait for the second season which I hope is just as Epic.",10,Tyrannicswine117

                NOTE: This review contains slight spoilers of the anime ""One Punch Man.""
After binge watching all twelve episodes in this highly comedic season of One Punch Man that was singlehandedly the most popular/anticipated anime of early summer in 2015, I have reached a conclusion—though my judgement of the show may be late, and I'm most definitely one of the fewer people that have just now watched this, my thoughts on One Punch Man is that it is awesome.
     One Punch Man revolves around one character whom searches to be a great hero—or this is what he longed to be when he was only an infant. After undergoing
                  great physical strength training, he become almost immortal, so overpowered that he can end any monster with just a single punch, dubbing him the ""One Punch Man."" Not long after he became a hero as a hobby, he began to be bored with the short work of destroying villains, monsters, organizations, etcetera; and hoped to find the feelings of ecstasy once more in battle with an opponent that is worthy of facing against his awe inspiring strength. I found this type of anime to be interesting because this means the lead, Saitama, is forced to find a new goal in life rather than mindlessly killing monsters that may or may not be a threat to his surroundings.
     I overall enjoyed this anime because of the comedic standpoint, but the emotional aspect of the show was obvious as well, as Saitama had grown feelings for his said ""disciple."" At the end of the anime, him and his lower classman still fight for the same cause as they had in the beginning after becoming professional heroes—to climb to the top and be the best. 
     All in all, I gave this anime a 10/10, as it is a respective score and is completely understandable as to why it would deserve this score. Highly recommended!",10,revankutaro

                This review has been written with the 12 episodes seen by me.
I had this anime pending and only 2 years later I have been able to see it complete at last... and I regret not seeing it at the time.
Story: 9
OPM (One punch man) has 12 chapters, enough time to develop a good plot, and undoubtedly, they did it. To be the first season was made clear what the series wants to convey.
Art: 8
The drawings are of very good quality, you can see the dedication when it comes to making the anime. The faster scenes of the fights lacked some quality, which is understandable since
                  it is quite complicated to do these scenes. They still do well.
Sound: 8
The musical compositions are very good, and nothing more. I only listened to the first 10 seconds of the opening and skipped the ending completely, so why give it an 8? Only and exclusively because I love rock.
Character: 7
In OPM they leave a little of the background of the characters to focus more on the fights, since after all that is the anime: fights, fights and more fights.
Enjoyment: 9
The fights are awesome, I doubt anyone gets bored. And if in the end the fighting becomes very repetitive always is the comedy.
Overall: 9
Have not you seen it? what are you waiting? This anime is almost mandatory, the best you'll see in a long time.",9,yayo89

                One Punch Man is my second favorite, and I love the story. It is the ideal way to get your friends into anime. It is short, beautifully animated, and amazingly well written. I have watched the first season through over three times, because I love it so much, twice on my own time, and one by convincing my friend to watch it at his birthday. We ended up staying up until 3:00 am in order to get as far as possible, and woke up at 8:00 or 9:00 am in order to finish it. They were not big anime fans, but One Punch Man appeals
                  to a wider audience. When trying to get a friend to watch anime, start with one punch man, then move to Fullmetal Alchemist, then continue with whatever else.
The action is fast-paced, and just beautiful. Just showing one of my friends who dislikes anime a particular scene, I almost got him to watch it (and he may have as of when you are reading this). It is what you should start with, as it is fairly ""normie"" as I have heard tossed around, but there is no problem with that. I have watched the anime 3 times, read the manga, and the web comic (though leading where the manga was caught up to). This is an anime I know at least seven people who have watched it, and are not into anime, and enjoyed it.
What I'm getting at is, it is so god damn good that everyone can enjoy it. Give it a try.",10,IDontKnowFish

                Having rewatched the series multiple times, I still find the jokes to be fresh and hilarious. The fight scenes are exhilarating and well choreographed, making it an overall entertaining anime.
A common criticism of the show is that it lacks depth – the plot and jokes get old after awhile because Saitama is too overpowered and every fight has the same outcome. To those who feel this way, I think you misunderstand what the show is about. The essence of the anime is the struggle for Saitama to enjoy fighting again and find a truly worthy opponent. The jokes are meant to be repetitive to reinforce
                  this idea. 
Also there is depth to this anime, like the corruptness of the hero system and Genos' character arc. 
Overall super entertaining anime and I highly recommend it to anyone.",9,No_Fac3

                What can I say
Spoiler alert!!!!!!!
There is nothing that hasn't been said about One Punch man, every Review every single word of everything each person has said about that anime in regards to the hype. It is the single best shounen parody in the world. Saitama is the under-appreciated main protagonist, but the real MVP is the one and only hero of Justice: Mumen Rider!!!!!!
He is us, us is he, he is the one who responds to the bat signal, he is the first to show up when you're in a pinch, he is our guardian angel, the rider of Justice, Mumen Rider.

                first things first i didn't like OPM probably bcoz i had too much expectations from the hype it was getting and got disappointed in the end although it wasnt a bad show.
so here goes my review:
story 2/10:
    well its same pattern till the end a bad guy comes kicks all the hero's asses to show how powerful he is then our super op mc comes and defeats him with one punch with ""so easy"" face just to be funny. Well it worked as a gag at 1st then i got bored of it.
Art  9/10:
       Art
                  was nice nothing to complain here.
Sound 7/10: 
        Sound was decent too.
Character 5/10:
        Everyone had their unique personalities which was nice but dont hope for any character development.our 2nd mc Genos was their to get his ass kicked 1st b4 mc comes puts everyone in awe how easily he beat bad guy to even make people think that he cheated lol.
Enjoyment 2/10:
        Didnt enjoy it bcoz of my high expectations which i gave up after 3 ep then i was watching for comedy which didnt really had much impact either only the action was good to enjoy
Overall  6/10:  
         After all my complaints it was still a decent show.They couldnt have done much with the concept they chose of one hitting every bad guy. everything was done properly but it gets boring after 1st few ep ,showing same patterns which makes us easily predict what to expect next.",6,Hearthclif

                One Punch Man’s story is simple- The story of an average guy who’s a hero for fun. Now what makes this unique is that this show is a parody. For people new to that genre, it’s an imitation of other work. Basically what this anime does is it makes a parody out of shounen genre, where you have a male protagonist who gets beaten down, and then trains or in some other way defeats the bad guy. Here, the MC is just over-powered to the extent that he gets depressed there’s no one strong enough to challenge him. You might think that such a strong
                  person would be revered as a God by the people. Sadly, you’re mistaken. The people don’t even know he exists!! . This really plays a major point in the later episodes, when Saitama has to show his strength infront of the public, and becomes one of the highlight of this series. This show was created to poke fun at all tropes in anime. This is a story made to enjoy, not to be taken seriously. Anyone who is open-minded will enjoy this anime to its full extent.
Art: 9/10
Now the only reason I gave this a 9 is because of the meticulously high standard set by Ufotable in the Fate series and Kara no Kyoukai movies. But by no means is it far behind. In most anime, usually the MC has some kind of weapon, you can just add some flashy effects to go with it. But here, we have a hero who’s weapon are just his fists . The fights had to be carefully drawn and animated. And when you have a studio like Madhouse doing it, you know they rarely disappoint. Fluid motion, spectacular effects, no weird faces, nothing overdramatic. Simple, yet awesome. The best part of this anime has to be the “Saitama Expressions”. If you didn’t smile atleast a little when you saw the “OK” face, then I guess your sense of humour is locked up somewhere. Madhouse know how to make the viewer enjoy the anime to the full extent. The way they used Tatsumaki’s “chibi mode” expressions from the webcomic, and boldly animated it in the anime deserves separate praise. Also the landscape for OPM universe is also brilliant. Even the ordinary people are drawn with careful details. Another important aspect here is the design for the villains, especially Sea King and Boros, each having something unique, and they give out the “strong, badass” vibe when you just look at them. Also, the art in the final episode is 11/10.
Sound: 10/10
God-level. Simply eargasmic. When you have an opening theme that makes you want to shout “ONE PUUUUUUUNCH!” every time you hear it, you know the soundtrack’s gonna be amazing. For me, the first thing I’d hear in my mind every morning when I wake up is someone shouting “ONE PUUUUUUNCH!” That’s how much I love that opening theme. From character bgm’s to fight themes, the music suits every situation perfectly, making them more epic. I would rewatch every episode again just to hear the music, that’s how good it is. The voice acting is also brilliant, especially Aoi Yuuki, who brilliantly brought out Tatsumaki’s bratty voice, and Yuki Kaji, whose voice fits Sonic’s character perfectly.
Character: 10/10
Once in a lifetime you watch shows where every character in it makes an impact. One Punch Man is mine. I can probably name every single character that appeared in these 12 episodes. That’s how much of an impact they make. Saitama with his care-free attitude, the loyal cyborg Genos, Jack’o Lantern Panic, Brattymaki, Justice Rider, the S-class heroes like Silver Fang, Metal Bat, Pri-Pri Prisoner, King, and all the others have a uniqueness that makes you remember them. Even characters whom play a cameo like Carnage Kabuto, Mosquito Girl, Snek, Stinger, Amai Mask manage to leave an impression, which is something most anime fail to do. And when you have such a strong character cast, the anime rarely falters.",10,TheStrongestHero

ENJOYMENT - 8
An anime brimmed with action and flashy fights, the word EPIC truly fits what One Punch Man is all about.
There's not much development in the story, at least, it wasn't the main focus. It mostly focuses on this overpowered bald man who seeks the thrill and enjoyment of battles that he had lost due to his immense power. Not to say it's a bad thing, but it did leave me questioning 'Is there more to it?'. While the plot did progress halfway through, I think the idea of only revolving around battles diminishes the interesting
                  aspects of the world of heroes, monsters and aliens. A lot of potential is out there and I believe that we'll get to see more of the other non-battle things. A stronger aspect that One Punch Man delivers is in the characters, especially the master-disciple relationship. Many of the other characters have their own cool power and personality so there's that boost of enjoyment. Seeing more of them is something I'll be looking for.
So, what about the battles? I can definitely say that Madhouse has the skills to make the word epic pop out. No arguments could be made about how eye catching, fluid and powerful the animations were. It was outstanding. The lighting and shakes made the scenes intense with all the explosions and power produced by the characters. All the more so, the sound effects amplified this even further. For the voice acting and OSTs, it was kind of average with the exceptions of a couple soundtracks. They did capture the personality of the characters, especially the main character.
One Punch Man begins as a story that fleshes out the world. We see all this powerful heroes and villains, but the story didn't really delve more into them except for the battles. I have hopes that their origins and goals will be introduced bit by bit in future seasons. In the meantime, this anime succeeds as being highly action-packed.",8,OVERPOWERED99

                At this point in time, I don't think there are enough words that can be said about One Punch Man.
As standout from the season AND international popularity? It's quite a highlight from 2015.
One Punch Man was thrilling from beginning to end. From the art to the music to the writing of the anime to the character development. It was all superb, especially considering all the source material behind it. The concept was taken to the stars and beyond and we can't help but be glad that they gave us such a great anime. 
The music was fitting for all the moments. It really fit the
                  feel and atmosphere of the anime as a whole. The OP was great since it pumped up each episode SO SO much. Also, the placement of the OP during the major fights was also sensational. The music made you want to be a hero and you too might feel like you could punch a hole into anything as well. 
The animation for the show was next level in my honest opinion. All of the movements are incredibly fluid and of the highest definition. The show centered on beings that have insane powers and I think the animation captured that incredibly well. The characters could be followed as they moved about and fought. I have to also tip my hat to the fight scenes in the show. They were simply sublime. They mixed the crisp full bodied animation that we grew accustomed to in the show but they also introduced sketchier drawing and art styles into the mix, not just for style points, but there were moments that when shown as very scrappy and sketchy line work and colors it drove home the intensity that much more. The animators were able to capture everything essential for a total package with regards to animating the fight scenes and epic moments. 
Now, for the object that has been subject to much debate. I believe that the story was very fulfilling and had just about everything you could have asked for. It was the perfect marriage between comedy, action, and even some slice of life/philosophical points were thrown in. The jokes were spot on for me. The interplay between Saitama being an INCREDIBLY strong hero and yet looking like a second rate hero always had me laughing. At its core, it is simple, but the delivery worked throughout the show just because of how nonsensical everything else was. The way Saitama acquired his power, the powers of the other heroes, the monsters that would randomly show up... they all just come out of nowhere and that let's the comedy work really well. I also think the show works well putting all these elements together because the plot is very loose. There is an overarching story but it isn't really that deep. It works better as a ""monster"" or ""scenario"" of the week and for me that delivered. It kept it airy enough that these jokes that were told week after week really stuck and hit every time. Also, the action was allowed to be fluid as well. It was great to see again and again how the heroes really did underestimate themselves as well as the monsters and Saitama. The naive nature and inability to believe in one another felt very real and honest and I think that drove the whole show home.
There isn't much to say about the characters except they are all great. Saitama being OP and yet kind of a lame guy. Genos being such a cool yet incredibly naive cyborg. The supporting heroes add well to the dynamic as well. They aren't too complex and play their roles in the just the right amount. Again, because the story isn't that deep and each episode is able to be enjoyed separately, the characters don't need that much depth besides how they choose to interact with each other and with Saitama. 
It was an incredible anime that had me anxious each week for new episodes. I am eagerly awaiting the 2nd season simply because this anime was put together extremely well. The packaging is incredible and with sprinkles of simplicity and dashes of brilliance, it has proven itself to be a real masterpiece.",10,Eddy_Kruger

                When I first saw the anime I got hoocked to it Definitely 10/10. Action ? This anime got it, Comedy ? This anime got it, Simple story not that complicated ? This anime got it. Clean animation, the opening theme is superb and so catchy. The characters are quite not bad their designs are fair not something special, but kind of needs more work on their backstory especially the main character. The ost is the most thing I liked about OPM. 
I recommend this anime for any people looking for something funny with fightin and over powerd characters all over the place. But don't expect
                  S2 to be good as S1.",10,XxWolfy98xX

                One Punch Man is entirely predictable and yet entirely captivating.
How do you write an anime where the premise is so cut and dry, a hero has the ability to kill anything with one punch? Where are the stakes? The buildup? The suspense? What kind of expectation or surprise can you possibly have out of something like this?
Well, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find a robust story, filled with comedy, great memorable characters, and insight on social constructs. 
Plenty for the casual watcher, and much more for anyone wanting to read into things more deeply. Great for multiple watches, the studio put so much detail into
                  every shot and line of dialogue that you'll find new things you didn't notice the time before.

                “	If the heroes run and hide, who will stay and fight?[9]	”
— Saitama to Genos
Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[10] The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[3] and he claims that his ability to feel any and all emotions has dulled considerably.[11] The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and ""unimpressive"" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will
                  usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[12]
Saitama has limited patience for long explanations, however, and will often interrupt the speaker.[13][14][15] His ideal word count is 20 or less.[13]
A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgot Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[16] or when he could not remember who Tanktop Tiger is.[17] Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[18]
 [Expand] 
The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers.
Saitama has been shown to be very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against the Deep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival.[19] He did the same for the police station, killing a monster while disguised as a police officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was.[20] He also did not mind that King took credit for all of his achievements.[21] Despite his humility and modesty, he still retains some sense of pride, since he wants to beat up Garou after realizing that the latter didn't want to hunt him during his hero hunt, just because he is a low-ranking hero who is not worthy to be hunted. However, Saitama's desire to pummel Garou mostly comes from his desire for an exciting and challenging fight, not for his pride as a powerful hero.
Another surprising thing about Saitama is that he is very tactful and insightful, being well able to discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him fairly easily. He was able to pick up a number of hints to Sonic's own persona upon their first meeting.[22] When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after the meteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discern Fubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[23]
Saitama has been shown to show remorse to his enemies before, particularly ones who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this is Boros, with whom Saitama sympathized, due to suffering from similar circumstances. Though in the end, even Boros still couldn't draw out Saitama's full power.[24] Garou is also one, as he recognized Garou did not want to become a monster, but rather felt that was his spot.
Saitama does not actually care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[25] the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything pertaining to his baldness.[26][27] He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. He also shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he fought Carnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent who had undergone a transformation and was beating him around.[28] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one actually knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[29] Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated when Genos listed off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes.
Saitama demonstrates impressive restraint with his power, considering that he is easily capable of splitting the sky or jumping from the moon to earth. He manages to beat nearly all of his opponents with a single punch, though occasionally causes more devastation than necessary. While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing another human and only ever uses enough strength to knock them out.
Becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's.[30] Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society like Hammerhead.[31]
Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos to quiet his revenge wishes and start training to become a good hero, also he's made insecure people like Fubuki and Glasses to stand up against their challenges and become better heroes, he also advices King to train and become strong for real, latter than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles.
As Fubuki notes, he ""attracts the strong"", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a linking to him, and some even looks on him as a model to follow.
Abilities and Powers
Saitama is the titular One-Punch Man and the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies have survived punches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. Saitama's only power is that his body is far beyond human limits, allowing him to achieve astounding physical feats. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such as mechanical beings or the mutated warriors from the House of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits - Saitama cannot fly or fire energy blasts - his superhuman abilities more than make up for the lack of variety in his powers.
The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all. According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength. This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out. He apparently continued his training for another year and a half before beginning his hero career. Genos believes that Saitama himself doesn't actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him, while Dr. Genus believes that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed his limiter. It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than would normally be expected.

Genos dominates Saitama in a eating contest.
Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested by Bang in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated by King in video games, mostly in one sided matches. Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.
Physical Abilities
Punchingmachine
Saitama's physical force
Immeasurable Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, nonchalant punch (although this strength is not limited to punches). Saitama's punch is so powerful that many enemies simply explode when struck. He is also shown to be able to effortlessly destroy walls and buildings. An example of this casual, yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a city-sized meteor with a punch, lands safely, and just calmly decides to go home. Another instance is when Sonic tries to slice Saitama's head in half with a steel sword, and Saitama stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw. Also, in the intro, Saitama was seen jumping to and fro at high speeds in the vacuum of outer space with just sheer strength, despite the fact that one would require a solid object to move there at all. When launched from Earth to the moon by a strike from Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and immense tremors on the surface of the moon upon departure, as well as on Boros' ship upon landing. A ""normal"" punch from him is shown to be very fatal to someone as durable as Boros. A single ""serious"" punch from him is able to somehow counter Boros' destructive energy beam attack, and split the sky in half along the whole planet effortlessly, and even then, Boros, who was the fatally injured victim of the said move, said that Saitama had plenty of strength to spare and that he did not even try to give it his best shot. Saitama has shown to be able to control the strength of his attacks but still tends to go overboard, occasionally causing mass destruction in the aftermath. Saitama is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to.[32]
Enhanced Leap: Saitama's inability to fly is somewhat compensated by his immense leg strength, allowing him to leap tremendous heights and distances at high speeds. This can be seen when Saitama smashed his head through the ceiling of a gymnasium during the hero tryouts simply by jumping.[33] He was also able to smash a building into its foundation just by leaping off from its roof.[34] His greatest feat in this regard, however, was when he leaped from the surface of the moon and ended up back on Earth at a specified point, leaving a crater on the moon's surface in the process.[35] He is also able to jump while still in the air, adjusting his angle of ascent or descent thanks to his amazing power.

The mountain is destroyed by the mere shockwaves from Saitama's punch.
Shockwaves: As shown in his training with Genos, Saitama can control and direct his power in the form of an massive shockwaves that comes from his punches. He uses this to show Genos a bit of his true power, but stops it before actually punching Genos; instead, the attack goes to the mountain behind Genos, which ends up completely destroyed.
Saitama dodge
Saitama dodges Genos' attack
Immeasurable Speed and Reflexes: Saitama was able to complete a 1500 meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[36] He has proven able to effortlessly keep up with Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, who is able to move at above hypersonic speeds.[37] Even Genos' computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[38] Saitama has also shown the ability to run down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[39] His speed is so impressive that he can even outpace the likes of Flashy Flash, easily dodging his sword swings, and later dodging Awakened Garou's attacks with ease.[40] When kicked to the Moon by Boros' attack, Saitama returned to Earth in mere moments, which shows that Saitama can even travel at sub-relativistic speeds. Ironically, despite his incredible reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[41]
Afterimages: Saitama is so fast that he leaves afterimages when moving at high speeds. He is agile enough to dodge Beast King's Lion Slash: Meteor Shower while moving in for the kill.[42] After assaulting Saitama with a flurry of punches in his practice fight, Genos realized that he was only fighting his afterimages.[43] It is shown that Saitama can control and decide the number of afterimages he leaves behind him.
Immeasurable Dexterity: Saitama is capable of moving any of his limbs at extremely fast speeds without even flinching, not stopping until his target is completely obliterated. This is seen when Saitama flawlessly whacks all moles on a Whack-A-Mole machine and destroys it during the Hero Association exam.[44] He is also very proficient with the control and use of his superhuman abilities.
Immeasurable Agility: Saitama has been shown to be perfect at dodging and able to perform highly acrobatic maneuvers. Saitama's reflexes render him flexible enough to move through the narrowest creeks and dodge attacks at the closest proximity.[45][46] Saitama is also able to perform parkour, which he can couple with fighting movements, as shown in his flashbacks.
Immense Stamina: Saitama has never been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. Even when unleashing a punch more powerful than a planet-destroying attack, Saitama showed no signs of fatigue. The only time in which Saitama was shown to be panting and out of breath, he recovered just seconds later.
Saitamaspeedface
Saitama keeps up with Sonic's speed
Immeasurable Senses: Saitama's senses are far beyond the human norm. He does possess impressively sharp hearing, being able to pick up on various chatter from bystanders a good distance away even while fighting monsters and the like.

Invulnerability: Saitama can withstand blows from extremely powerful beings such as Carnage Kabuto without taking a scratch or feeling any pain.[47] When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remains standing right next to him completely unharmed, unperturbed and very dirty (though his clothes were burnt).[48] He also survived being kicked to the moon by Boros in his fully powered state, and going from the Earth to the moon and back with little to no damage from leaving and entering the Earth's atmosphere (only his clothes were burnt). He even survived the harsh conditions of outer space unscathed during his brief time on the Moon.[49]
Saitama also prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. It has been shown that, despite the dangers of holding one's breath in space, Saitama is able to do so with no negative effects on his body. However, it is worth noting that Saitama sees mosquitoes as a potential weakness, preferring to hide from the mosquito swarm heading his way rather than confront it, although he did not know that a monster was responsible for the swarm in the first place.
Psychic Immunity: Fubuki noted that Saitama is immune to any psychic attacks and very resistant to others due to his astonishing willpower.

Enhanced Lung Capacity: Although Saitama cannot breathe in space, he has considerable control over his breath. Even in outer space, Saitama manages to hold his breath effortlessly, and he even made a jump back to the Earth to the Moon in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation or symptoms. It also takes some time for Saitama to realize he is in a vacuum environment, although it seemed to have little to no effect on him.[50]

Saitama holds his breath in the moon with no problem.
Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama's body has been shown to survive the effects of a vacuum unscathed. Several factors like a lack of atmosphere are at play here, although Saitama has been unable to be affected by any of them.
Temperature Immunity: Saitama is immune to all types of temperature-based attacks. In fact, he is immune to the effects of temperature in general. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing next to him unperturbed and completely unharmed (although his clothes were destroyed).[51] Saitama was unharmed by the intense heat effects caused by atmospheric re-entry after being kicked to the moon by Boros. He has also been shown to be unaffected by Orochi's fire in his ultimate form, which has the ability to crumble or even destroy a city, if not multiple. Saitama was also able to withstand the cold attack of the Dragon-level monster Withered Sprout.
Pain Suppression: Before gaining his overwhelming power, Saitama was still able to suppress pain.[52][53]
Fighting Style
Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Despite having no formal training, Saitama is a very proficient hand-to-hand combatant, thanks to so many fights with monsters and villains during his training, he's got a lot of fighting experience and developed a good deal of fighting skills. Due to his immeasurable power and boredom, he doesn't usually care about technique and makes use of flawed basic attacks, as Garou notes, most of his usual moves are wasted and lack finesse; however, once serious, Saitama becomes a very skilled and powerful fighter. Saitama mostly uses improvised fighting techniques to take down his enemies, his combat skills allowed him to defeat many criminals and monsters even before gaining his immeasurable power. His fighting styles are (unlike the likes of Garou, Bomb, Suiryu and Bang) quite simple, but solid and backed with his immeasurable power, extremely efficient, he can easily read, counter and strike moves and techniques from fighters with far more experience and training than him. He is also able to skillfully combine his superhuman abilities in order to overwhelm his opponents and even use the environment to his benefit.
He also uses karate chops and grappling moves to takedown villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him.
Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed his first monster by deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general, whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes with a solution with one way or another and uses very unique moves that are helped by his immeasurable strength. Such instances are with Serious Headbutt and his Serious Table Flip.
Extremely High Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since anytime he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. In the opening of the first season, he is seen striking multiple enemies at once and hitting all of them at the same time. He is also able to turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He had no trouble landing in the same spot on Boros' ship even though the latter's kick sent him to the moon, and the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving very little room for error.
Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's extreme strength and speed.
Normalpunch
Consecutive Normal Punches
Consecutive Normal Punches: (連続普通のパンチ, Renzoku Futsuu no Panchi) Saitama launches a volley of quick, single-handed punches from his right hand. These blows have been shown to be powerful enough to blow strong or large body types apart into pieces. Depending on the power of the attack, this technique can occur in an instant.
Normal Punch: Saitama simply punches his opponent. Even though Saitama puts very little to no effort in his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent of Saitama, including Dragon-Level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing their skulls and bones or even beheading them. When facing humans however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out. The shock wave from one of these punches was strong enough to tear apart one of the subterranean people (although this only happened in a dream of Saitama).

Serious Series (必殺マジシリーズ, Hissatsu Majishirīzu): In Serious Series, Saitama still attacks without putting in much effort. But Saitama's face looks more serious when he performs Serious Series attacks.
SeriousPunch
Serious Punch
Serious Punch: (マジ殴り, Maji Naguri) Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch. The full extent of this attack is unknown, as it has never directly hit an opponent. It was so powerful that it completely negated Boros' Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet.[54] The shockwave alone from the punch was powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final fatal blow to Boros. The dying Boros then also declared that Saitama's fatal attack on him was not even anywhere near Saitama's true power and that Saitama was still holding back.[55]
Serious Side Hops: (マジ反復横とび, Maji Hanpukuyokotobi) Saitama hops from side-to-side rapidly. Doing so creates a multitude of afterimages in the form of a wall. He has been shown to be able to walk forward while doing so, and the shockwaves caused by it was enough to easily rip through Sonic's Ten Shadows Burial. [56]
Death Punch: Saitama throws a very fast and very powerful punch at his opponent, that is filled with the intention to kill. While performing the attack, for a moment, Saitama and his fist appears to have become gigantic, his aura becomes visible and Saitama's opponent is forced to experience impending death while watching the punch hurling towards them and being unable to do anything. The full extent of this punch has yet to be seen since Saitama has always stopped his attack before it could connect, but the shock wave caused by the punch was strong enough to blow a gigantic hole into several mountains and clouds.

Water Polo Carbonated Fist: A ""martial art"" utilized by Saitama during the 22nd Super Fight, in reality, is just Saitama avoiding to lose his wig, as he was pretending to be Charanko to participate in the tournament. It also contains a hip strike to counter an enemy's attack and send him flying with the power of his own attack being used against him (although in truth it was just meant to mimic Suiryu's tornado movements).
Martial Arts: While Saitama is nowhere near as skilled as most martial artists, he seems to have some basic level of knowledge of some martial arts movements (a basic karate chop for example). In order to truly understand these fighting styles, he joined the 22nd Super Fight to witness other martial artists; after his fight with Suiryu, the latter asks him if he's truly understood the meaning behind martial arts, at which Saitama replies is about ""cool movements"". It is unclear if Saitama has gotten any skill in martial arts by this point, but he seems more interested in learning it.
Miscellaneous Abilities
Keen Perception: Saitama is amazingly good at reading people's fears and real motives with just a look, as well the reason they are how they are. He proves this many times reading people like Fubuki, Glasses, and Garou. Notably, he is the first to acknowledge the true thoughts and insecurities of the martial artist, as he realizes Garou doesn't really want to become a monster, but rather a hero. He also quickly finds about King's lie, but decides to keep the secret. However, he is usually good at this only when he is serious.
Strong Teeth: In one of his and Sonic's fights, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the caped baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort.
Intimidation: While he doesn't seem particularly scary, those who know about his abilities show fear of him. Saitama is able to emit a ""demonic aura"", which makes his foes tremble and become pressured, as Sonic and Genos were left amazed and terrified by his aura. Saitama is able to invoke fear on those he dislikes or bothers him by merely threatening them.
Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[57] Through sheer willpower and effort, he removed his natural limiter.",10,Honghan1995

                One Punch Man=Action/Humor.
Long reviews waste your time so here's one short paragraph.
Don't let the fact that this dude kills bad guys with one punch deter you. The developers knew that would get boring, so he is always accompanied by balanced heros to give you an action packed fix with dire circumstances. That being said, the characters in this anime are great! The heros he encounters all have unique personalities and abilities. It's also hilarious to see the different villains that emerge. One Punch Man tries to achieve ranks in a hero society of this story so he can become popular and recognized. But everyone thinks
                  he is just a cheater even though he's the most powerful hero alive. The irony they build here will have you rolling in laughter. The art design is great. Everything is drawn with great detail and the fight scenes are epic in scale. The soundtrack isn't bad but it's not great. They throw in some distorted guitar and it sort of has is grungy garage band feel so it's okay. At the end of the day, One Punch Man isn't at the top of my list but it's definitely worth a watch. 
Pros:
-Hilarious heroes and villains.
-Unique and humorous storyline.(it's not what you'd expect)
-Solid MC.
-Incredible action and art.
Cons:
-Unspectacular soundtrack.",8,GodBlessDXD

                One of the most entertaining animes I've seen, you can not get bored in each chapter, all is well animated, fights are exciting, the soundtrack is great, it's very, very recommended.
I will not give spoilers because there is not much to say about this series, the name and the opening say it all.
What it is interesting are the characters who have a history of his past that does not reveal the series yet, for that time the manga
This series is to enjoy the fights and great animation, the story is simple itself. And I do not say that is the best anime in the world
                  because he had put 10, but no; because it is not anything special.",9,igual1

                One Punch man is an amazing anime, and would almost get a 10 out of me for sure! Well, if it wasn't for Saitama, the One Punch Man. 
The art and the sound are sublime. The battle scenes are amazing as well. Even (most of) the characters look really unique and are fun to watch to say the least. It's all just so good! The story could be a bit better, but it's still decent enough to enjoy.
The only major thing that holds this anime back in my opinion, is Saitama, the One Punch Man himself. Why? Well, I call it the Superman-effect. As soon
                  as Saitama appears on the scene, you 100% know the battle is already over. It doesn't matter what else is going on, how many villains there are, what plans or overwhelming power any of them have left... Once the One Punch Man is there, he owns literally everyone without even shedding a single drop of sweat. 
I get that it's meant to be a joke/parody in and of itself, and that it shouldn't be taken too seriously... But this just kills the excitement for me, to be honest. 
This was the case with almost every fight, where it was super interesting to watch, but then One Punch Man shows up and it ends instantly. No damage taken, no effort put in, usually over in literally one hit (hence Saitama's title)... This is not only very boring, but it also cuts so many interesting villains short. 
I'm ok with a lot of overpowered anime protagonists, at least most of them still seem to have to put in some effort. But when One Punch Man can literally take no damage while dealing out an infinite amount himself, all while putting in no effort whatsoever, I start hoping he DOESN'T appear and let the fighting to all the other heroes... If only to make the battles exciting to watch. 
Still, despite the horrible character that is Saitama, the rest of the anime remains really enjoying to watch, so it'll get a pass from me.",6,Zerathos_Dagon

                Well, I don't know how to start about this anime. I remembered that I used read a manga and man, it was horrible work but somehow it keep me interesting into it. After what I heard about getting an anime series so I got really excited about it. 
Luckily, it hadn't brought my hopes up because I am start fell in love with how they do with many animations! I may be deaf, but when I put my hearing aids to keep me hearing, and then there are the sounds! It was impressive soundtracks! For story, it was really great to me, it hadn't reach
                  to outstanding. It was pretty slow a bit but at least they put great characters into it too! That anime keep my enjoyments at outstanding! Alongside those arts! It was beautifully done as I continue watch till last episode of One-Punch Man. I am looking forward to it second season!
I will love to recommend this by 10/10! However, as you are aware of many communities that talked about being overpowered characters, don't worry about it! They are not worth to listen! Ignore and watch this anime!",10,Fire_Fistt

                One Punch Man is an action-comedy and essentially a parody of the superhero genre, in which a man named Saitama has grown too powerful as a hero, and can defeat any enemy in just one punch. The problem he faces is no longer the monsters he fights, but the boredom in ending every battle in just a single blow, and the lack of any real thrill or excitement. Saitama's boredom and lifelessness is frequently used for humour, with the ridiculously exaggerated monsters contrasting with Saitama's deadpan and nonchalant attitude, and Saitama caring much more about day-to-day activities and shopping discounts, than city-threatening aliens. 
Along with
                  Saitama, there are characters such as Genos, a revenge-seeking cyborg with a constantly serious and analytical attitude towards unimportant matters, or Mumen Rider, a physically ordinary cyclist without any real superpowers but the public love him and he will persevere against even the toughest of enemies, or Tatsumaki, a child-like but very powerful telekinetic who gets angry that everyone ignores her. But while these characters are all somewhat entertaining in their own way, I think it's Saitama that really carries this show, and his screen-on time is ultimately what kept me engaged. 
One of the problems with a purposely overpowered protagonist is the lack of stakes when it comes to fights - Saitama doesn't encounter any obstacles or difficulties, and there is no issue which needs resolving. Instead of this however, the show uses the issue of public image and people not knowing about Saitama's extreme power (in addition to Saitama's boredom). One of the key aspects that plays into this is the hero class system, in which heroes such as Saitama are divided into classes and rankings based on their feats. For me, Saitama moving up through the hero rankings, and people slowly discovering his strength, were a major part of why I found this show engaging, and kept on wanting to watch the next episode. 
Other than that, the soundtrack for this show was pretty enjoyable, with a mix of upbeat heroic themes, and more melancholy ballads, but it all fits in with the show quite nicely. I'd also advise that you watch the intro at least for the first few episodes, because getting to know that intro makes one particularly epic scene transform into absolute hype insanity, where you just get the urge to clap your hands and yell, 'Yeah!' The art in this show was pretty great too, with a lot of well-done action sequences throughout, and an incredible finale.

                The story is very simple in nature, but the real beauty of the anime is the execution of the story. They have a phenomenal animation that helps to really show off the high points of this anime. The fluidity of the fight scenes, the epicness of Saitama just being Saitama. The best part of the animation is it doesn’t just make Saitama look epic, but it also manages to give other characters time to shine.   One-Punch Man is a very fast paced anime. It doesn’t have a slow start like most Animes, you are thrust into intense action from episode 1 and on.
                  The Beauty of One-Punch Man is that accomplishes what it needs to do. It comes in gives us intense action, decent comedy and leaves without us feeling bored or repetitive of the episodes.",10,Gentleman_Snark
30276,"
                Let me start out by saying, this is not my type of genre. I normally watch Rom-Coms, Slice of Life and the occasional Fantasy, Thriller, Horror, and yes, action. I WAS not a fan of this show since I have been putting it off because of people over-hyping it and proclaiming it is one of the best ones out there. Let me just say, that if you are putting this off because of the over-hype and and the negative reviews, give it a shot, at least the first episode.
Lets start out with the story.
The Story (9/10)
Although the story is not in any way complex, it
                  is very entertaining. I binge watched this all in one day because I couldn't get enough of Saitama, the main character. 
The story tells of an overwhelmingly powered hero going around, searching for the ultimately enemy, only to defeat them with one punch (Hence the title for the character) Saitama encounters many friends and foes along his journey to find the greatest enemy, including Genos, a cyborg trying to increase his strength by following Saitama and being his ""Disciple"". The Story was nothing incredibly complex, but nothing incredibly stupid either. It had a good amount of well placed comedy and breath taking action that kept the story going, and not just amount for tons of aimless spent time. 
The Art (10/10)
Oh my goodness. where do I even begin with this. ITS MADHOUSE. This is a studio known for it's breath taking animation and visuals. Other than the studio UFOTABLE, this is the only other studio able to take my breath away with beautifully drawn, fast paced visuals. To be honest, the only other anime that has blown my mind with this amount of quality is Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Bladeworks. (Or more commonly known as Unlimited BUDGETworks due to its overwhelming quality in each episode) But I have not come here to review about UBW so much as give an opinion on the visuals. What really stands out for me in this series was the ""practice"" fight between Genos and Saitama. With the visuals being increadibly well drawn and the action being kept as fast paced as possible, I was not in any way disappointed ever in each fight scene throughout the series. But not even that, what really takes the cake is each animation with Saitama's face. Sure he may seem average and even simply drawn, but that is just Saitama's face. When he submerges in a fight....oh boy...does his face change like *that*. He often goes from not caring about whats going on, to super serious, and back to not caring at all. Blink and you'll miss it. Truly masterful animation from MADHOUSE.
The Sound.
Whether it (surprisingly) becomes a touching moment (look to episode 9 when Mumen Rider is fighting off the ""Sea Freak"") to an epic battle, the music conveys the feelings you should be feeling. Whether you're feeling pumped up for the ongoing fight, to the care free life and times of Saitama, the music is not in anyway disappointing. I especially liked the OP. I couldn't have thought of a better OP than the one here. I feel the word BAD ASS all over the place. Watching the intro before actually watching the anime, I knew what I was getting into. ""This guy is legit"". An anime of pure epicness. 
The Character. (10/10)
Saitama. Favorite character. of. all. time. He has become so charismatic for me for some reason. He is extremely powerful, but does not care for it, as he is only a ""hero for fun"". He takes being a hero as a hobby, rather than a full time duty necessary for his or others living. He really does not need to progress as a character, as, in my opinion, he already is the perfect character. Now is Genos. An incredibly powerful cyborg that is wanting to increase his abilities and strength by going under the discipleship of Saitama. He is faithful to Saitama as a disciple and continues to follow him to learn ways of increasing his strength. BUT he does progress as a character, from being over clingy to Saitama in a sense, to being dependent upon what Saitama has ""taught"" him instead of his master.
Other characters encountered by Saitama, although side characters, are well written and are all surprisingly incorporated into the story very well. With each character having a role further into the series, you actually seem to remember a large majority of them.
Enjoyment. (10/10)
Well it all comes down to this. Did I enjoy it? 
HELL YEAH.
Never in my life have I been so overwhelmed by an anime. Whether it was when I was laughing my head off, to gasping over the ridiculous strength Saitama was capable of, you could say I enjoyed this more than I should have. 
Overall (9.8)
If you are looking for an anime that is just overall awesome, The One Punch Man will in no way disappoint. From the well placed comedy, to the breath taking visuals, to the strong (literally) characters, to the intense fast paced action, prepare to be amazed by the one punch man. 
This is all coming from someone who prefers light Rom-Coms and Slice of Life animes.",9,PurestForm

                I always thought that One Punch Man wasn't my type, but my best friend left her Saitama's sweater at my house years ago, and the last week I put the sweater on and thought ""Mh well, maybe I can start watching One Punch Man while I do things"" and I did.
And no regrets. 0 regrets.
It's honestly one of the best anime I've ever seen. The story, characters, I'm in love with Saitama, he is a perfectly created character, the backstory of Genos, the last villain, the hard cuteness of Tatsumaki (because she is really cute in her way), Sonic pls... next, the music??????? nothing more
                  to say, is the best!
Conclusion: never think One Punch Man is not your kind of anime.",10,dekkchan
30276,"
                I made this account to write this review, because sometimes even the world's greatest defender needs defending. The thing is, I wouldn't think twice about about giving this anime a 10, and that's the point. The total score isn't even necessarily a sum of its individual factors. It's not an anime that requires a great deal of thinking. Not everything good in this world does or should. To denounce OPM because of this is the conclusion of an overly critical mind.
Some call this a love/hate series, but as seen by the many 5-8s, this is not entirely accurate. What I think is it's a love/look-down-on
                  series. Some love it, and others find it good or average or trash but consider it inferior to animes with intricate methods of storytelling. To disregard OPM for its innocent nature is to do yourself and the show a great disservice. There is a saying which you've likely heard: ""It takes all kinds to make the world go 'round."" This is true in all things, equally true for art as it is for people. Does OPM have the same style of masterful storytelling as HxH, or the same gripping, meticulously thought out plot of Monster? No. Does it need to? Hell no. In fact, it is better without it. What a viewer should instead ask is: Does OPM achieve what it sets out to do? That answer is yes. By god, yes, and to a degree that is equalled only by other animes crafted with similar lev
els of mastery. This show is mindless fun with lots of heart and production value. What it aims to do is simply be enjoyed. And I'll squeeze it in here, Genos is a great character and Saitama is hilarious and badass.
Now, if the reason you don't like this anime is because you don't agree with its humor, that is something I cannot objectively argue. Personally, I think its style of parody fits the show perfectly. But I will say that although humor is by far its most prominent element and the mechanic which drives the show, it is again doing the anime a disservice to say it has nothing else going for it. In addition to the well-built action, the simple, childlike nature of a story which is about heroes who want to protect mankind from destruction is presented in a continually inspiring way by the second half. Saitama's development from Hero-For-Fun to self-proclaimed, largely unrecognised defender of the world's justice really gets me. Again, I'm not claiming there is any masterful storytelling here, but if you can't find inspiration in it then embrace your inner-child and general giving a shit about the betterment of mankind and watch the show again. These themes are presented well to say the least.
This deeper meaning to an otherwise comedic story teamed with its passionate, skillful direction, outstanding acting (in the Japanese), and 11/10 production value makes it a masterpiece in my books. Albeit a peculiar, goofy masterpiece, but IMO that only makes it as brave as its hero who reminds us that, in the end, good will always triumph over evil, and the world is worth protecting. You don't need to think too much about that.",10,Redreach

                Going into this anime I was nervous asf. Rarely does any work of fiction live up to hype this big, and One-Punch Man was one of if not the most hyped anime of 2015. It's been a over year since season 1 ended and with a highly anticipated season 2 coming, One-Punch Man remains to be heavily talked about among anime fans. Like for most animes I watch, I watched this series in both sub and dub and after finishing it, I'm glad to say I think it's a great series. It is however, not flawless, which is no big deal tho as it only
                  has a few flaws. Here are my pros and cons; ***contains MINOR spoilers***
Story:9/10                                               
What makes this anime so special is how non-cliché it is to both the superhero and shonen genre. We've seen a lot of superhero works that have its heroes have similar backgrounds and motives, almost to the point where majority of the superhero stories are almost the same. We've also seen a lot of action animes that suffer from trying to be too serious.This anime however is completely different as it throws all those clichés out the window. Saitama doesn't care about fighting for justice nor did he have a traumatizing past that gave him motives to fight crime, he was normal guy who dreamt about being a superhero so he just trained nonstop for a long time and gained enormous strength. And not only is it non serious, but it actually tries to make fun of itself. The comedy and humor to the series is so strong that it'll have you laughing almost at all times. It's all these unique and different ideas that makes this storyline very good.
Art:10/10
Maybe the biggest standout of the series, I mean seriously does Madhouse ever disappoint ?? Madhouse is well known for its great animation an OPM is w/o a doubt one of its finest works. The animation and visuals are so well done that at times it almost feels like you're watching it in 3D. The quality of the animation is so high and the fights look so fluid that it makes the action look more real and enjoyable. It handles explosion very well and contains stunning visuals. An example of this would be the Boros fight as it's one of the best animated battle scenes in history. It also had some hilariously great character designs that added extra flavor to the humor, an example of this would be Crablante. Boros' design was AMAZING, he's one of the coolest looking characters Ive ever seen. 
Sound:9/10
Although it won't fall under as one of my favorite soundtracks ever, the music is SO LIT. It centers mostly around rock wit some dubstep. The opening theme is by far my fav part of the soundtrack because it's hype asf and it fits very well with the series. Its ending theme had a nice soothing sound to it and is sang beautifully by Hiroko Moriguchi. Although the dub has been criticize by a few pple, I personally found it to be pretty good. Genos was the one character that received the most hate cuz his English voice didn't sound like a 19 year old but he sounded robotic and spoke rarely with emotion like how a cyborg should sound so to me he was acceptable. Saitama was pretty good his VA did a good job in bringing the humor out of him and last I was impressed with Sonic's VA cuz his voice matched perfectly with his appearance. But even so, I enjoyed the sub more cuz of how natural it was and it was a lil funnier. Plus let's be honest, Makoto Furukawa IS Saitama.
Character:8/10
Saitama and Genos were w/o the two shines of the cast. We really got to care for both of them and seeing them together brought a lot of memorable and hilarious scenes. What makes Saitama so great is that because of how laid back and unimpressive his appearance is, pple tend to underestimate him and when they get their asses kicked by him it becomes very satisfying. And because of his mindset and personality it's funny to see how pple respond to him. What makes Genos such a good deuteragonist is that there are times where we rather root for him because his motives are more understandable and since hes not up to Saitama in terms of strength his fights are more fun to watch since he has more of a challenge. What made the villains special was that the show put a lot of effort into their unique backstories and awesome designs(only to be killed in the next few seconds.) What it did however was make them relevant during the episodes and posed a threat to the other characters. There are several other characters like members of the Hero Association but most if not all them weren't given enough development but for a 12 episode season, that was almost impossible to do.
Final Verdict 
Pros
+A very original and non-cliché story that deconstructs the superhero genre
+Top production values with incredible animation and awesome music that fits the show's hype scenes
+Saitama and Genos' unlikely friendship makes for an outstanding on screen duo to watch
+Over the top action and hilarious comedy makes for an overall entertaining show
Cons
-The two leads need more backstory to be fully fleshed out
-Saitama's overpowering strength leads to predictable outcomes
One can argue and say that One-Punch Man is more of a fan service anime, as we were given 12 episodes of non-stop action with a lot of laughs. But to me it's more than that, it's a genre deconstruction. With its unique ideas and creative writing, this makes One-Punch Man a work of fiction that I've never seen before. I recommend this to almost everyone as it's too enjoyable and too funny to miss out on. However if people are looking to get a more substantial story then this isn't the show for you. One-Punch Man has quickly became one of my favorite animes ever and I'm dying for its next season to be released.

                What a great anime!
Another masterpiece from Madhouse, a fantastic anime, with perfect production, incredible direction, charismatic and funny characters and hilarious villains. Incredible animations and legendary fights, make this anime one of my favorites of all time.
At first, I found the idea of ​​a protagonist who defeats all his opponents with just one blow a bit bizarre, but I was wrong. Along with this idea, the author manages to put on a great comedy and several references and jokes with different cultures!
Really, splendid. In addition to the protagonist Saitama being one of the best fictional characters I have ever seen, the way he deals with
                  situations is approached in a very good way. So, Madhouse, congratulations, you just became my favorite studio, after Hunter x Hunter and One Punch Man.",10,ClodovilCerveja

                it's pretty hard to say it, but this show wasn't as good as people say it was, in my opinion its the overrated anime of the year, i stopped after the first episode with my brother telling it ""gets better"" and totally did not, please don't attack me for saying bad things about this anime cause i'm really just saying what i think.
for starters i would like to say that i already watched ALOT of animes, the impossibly long ones such as Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and the short ones such as tokyo ghoul, parasyte and much more, along with alot of comedies such
                  as the big bang theory, how i met your mother and stuff, so you cant say i have no sense of humor and no knowledge of anime so lets begin
Story:
i gave the story only 6 because it was kinda boring, a man who can beat anyone with one punch, wheres the fun in that? i like action and this definitely was an anime that i can say that had absolutely no action, the ""comedy"" part was fun at first but becomes old after a while, it laughed alot about all the anime cliches, from encouraging someone and he suddenly gets super strong or the extremely long backstorys and more, but as someone who watched animes and already saw those things happen it was something im used to and not really funny anymore, so i dont like that anime as a comedy and not as an action anime, so what am i supposed to love here? the last few episodes did try to have some action but didnt work out because of the complete purpose of the show, a man who can beat anyone with only one punch, so SPOILER ALERT ABOUT THE SHOW, he beats everyone in one punch.. no matter who it is, so no i do not like the story from the android who tries to learn from him or the hero association which plays almost no rule because he is the one who beats all the enemies and the others just get their asses kicked
Art:
with all the bad story you cant argue with the fact that its an anime that came out in 2015, the quality and the art are off the charts
Sound:
although i dont like the anime, i still downloaded the opening to my phone cause i really like it, the so called ""battles"" have some nice music
Character:
 the characters are pretty expected and not unique on the series, the one punch man is just a boring normal man who can beat anyone, the android has a backstory which is so played out in all the animes, and you barely see any of the other characters... (other then that girl looking guy cause lets admit it every anime has one)
Enjoyment:
well i pretty much stated it on the story.... i didnt like the anime, its not my definition of a good anime, only watched it cause i thought it might get interesting in some point and for me it didnt, doesnt mean its not good for others but not for me..
overall, i didnt like the anime, the idea of a man who can win all battles with one punch is stupid... they could have made stronger enemies but chose that the strongest man in the universe got his ass kicked by Saitama.. so im pretty sure (and hope) theres no more episodes coming out and kinda hope this anime will get off the top 10 on myanimelist and the 1st place in kissanime cause i hate seeing this overrated anime getting so much fame",4,almogrd

                (Small spoilers for Re:zero, My Hero Academia season 2 and The Dark Knight ahead. They won’t be prevalent in the review, but I will bring them up at one point. Of course there are big spoilers for OPM too)
There are very few protagonists that I REALLY root for. Most main characters in the shows I watch are enjoyable, maybe even has some depth to them and some of them might even be very relatable and realistic. But it is very rare for me to find a protagonist that I TRULY root for. Where I want them to succeed. If I would choose a few of
                  them, it would be Kotarou from Tsuki ga Kirei and Bojack Horseman from Bojack Horseman (Not an anime, but it doesn’t matter). But one of the best I have ever seen is Saitama from One Punch Man. 
I rarely ever care about character’s decisions in a show or movie. Or to be more precise, I rarely ever get angry at a characters decision even though I understand why he or she decides to do it. 
Subaru chooses Emilia over Rem, who cares they’re both boring as hell. 
Izuku decides to help Todoroki get over his anger against his father, I just agreed with his actions.
But something about the fact that Saitama decides to not only not show off his cool ass power, he even makes people hate him to make society like the other heroes more. 
Don’t get me wrong, it is understandable why he does it. I’m not bringing it up cause I think he’s stupid or an asshole. Saitama is a great character because of this. 
In episode 7, One Punch Man has destroyed a meteor that could’ve killed all of city Z. The price of this however is that the meteor separate into smaller parts, destroying a large part of the city. How does society thank him, by putting him on blast, shitting on him, screaming at him to give up. And just the fact that Saitama doesn’t kill every single one of those fuckers makes him a great character and makes me scream at the computer at the same time (I didn’t do that, but I really felt like it).
I don’t know, it’s hard to explain. In summary, Saitama doesn’t give a fuck. 
He doesn’t care that everyone hates him, he even makes them hate him more.
He doesn’t care that the S-rank members don’t know that he is the ultimate hero, cause he just does it for fun. 
There were so many times where Saitama shows how good of a person that he is, but I wanted him to become a worse one. 
This might sound bad, but to me that’s what makes him such a fantastic character. He makes the show IMO. 
But sadly, this quality isn’t anywhere else. 
While I LOVED Saitama and Mumen Rider (Who I won’t talk about since this review will just get twice as long), the rest of the characters were surprisingly forgettable. Genos doesn’t really have any flare to him, The enemies weren’t that memorable (Except for one, which I’ll talk about later) and the heroes are as plain. They were enjoyable to watch, don’t get me wrong. But there wasn’t anything to them IMO. It might be because Saitama and Mumen rider out-shined them enough to make fine characters look bad. But I was surprised at how much I didn’t care for the story unless mumen rider or Saitama was there. 
And while that was the worst part of the show, there was one other part that I found nearly as bad. The exposition.
While I liked the dialogue for the most part, where Saitama's was again the best, there was an abundance of very badly written exposition in the dialogue. Lines like “I can blast through a 20mm steel plate with one of my shape-memory golden bullets”. A character by the name of Golden ball says this when fighting an enemy. He’s not explaining his power/weapon, where it would be natural for him to say what he can do. But he says it to his friend who knows his power very well, and the monster that he plans to kill. So why would he say this other than that he wants the audience to know what power he has. And he’s not an important character. We don’t need to know what his power is, because he is in one scene. 
This exposition is present throughout the whole show. And while it wasn’t as bad as Suicide Squad, with lines like ""This is Katana. She's got my back. She can cut all of you in half with one sword stroke, just like mowing the lawn. I would advise not getting killed by her. Her sword traps the souls of its victims. "", just the fact that I’m comparing this show to one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen means that it’s bad. 
And while there are lots of things I really dislike about this show, LOTS OF THINGS. I just want to talk about one more thing. 
Boros vs Saitama
Something about this fight is so… fascinating. I’ll try to explain why.
Firstly, the animation is fucking incredible. The show has an overall fantastic animation except for some weird lip syncing and bad animation which were far and few between. But in that one fight, the animation was just so incredible. It’s probably one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. Up there with Mob Psycho 100’s Koyama fight and all of Mad Max: Fury Road. 
There are a lot of fight scenes that have incredible animation in this show, but they weren’t nearly as memorable as this. But there was one more thing. And that’s the character that is introduced in that “arc” or whatever you would call it. And that is Boros himself. 
Probably the best antagonist I have ever seen is The Joker from The Dark Knight. I can talk about him for hours, and I have at points. But one of the things that makes him such a great antagonist for batman is that he has the same goal as him. They both want the soul of Gotham. And in many ways this is similar with Boros and Saitama. 
Both of them dream of meeting an opponent who doesn’t die instantly. They just go about it in different ways. While Saitama dreams about it literally and is disappointed if a monster is killed by one punch, Boros tries to quench this thirst by going to as many planets as possible to find the opponent who can really challenge him. And I found that really interesting. 
But yeah, I really enjoyed this show even though I disliked many parts of it. I’ll give it an 8/10 for now.
Don’t think I have ever compared a show or movie to one of the best and worst movies I have ever seen, but it is what it is I guess.",8,Protogeist

                SPOILER FREE!!!!!
ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH!!!!!! OPM is a great action/comedy show that is genuinely hilarious and sometimes heartwarming.
Pros:
Amazing character designs. Even Mumen Rider looks amazing
Amazing characters. My favorites are Genos, Saitama, Sonic, and Mumen.Fantastic animation that captures the strength of the characters perfectly
A scene with Mumen Rider that genuinely made me tear up.
Some of the funniest jokes I've seen in anime.
Cons:
Quick, throwaway villains that don't take away too much from the show.
If you want a serious anime, this isn't for you. Almost everything is played off as a joke.
Saitama is obviously OP. Some extremely cool battles come to a skidding stop just because he shows up.
Repeated jokes, that don't turn stale too often.
Overall? Amazing show. One of my favorites. Hilarious, awesome, and outstanding. I would recommend this to anyone.",9,TwoSwordStyle

                Back In 2015 superheroes have never been quite as ubiquitous (or overexposed, depending on your viewpoint) as they are right now.  A perfect time for a parody, you might say. This might at least begin to explain why One Punch Man has been so successful around that time.
Starting life as a self-published webcomic by an artist calling himself ONE, it was later adapted into a professional comic, with art by Yusuke Murata (Eyeshield 21) which was later published in the English version of Shonen Jump and has been a bestseller in collected volumes.  It was then adapted into an anime series by Studio
                  Madhouse, which originally aired between October and December of 2015.
The series stars Saitama, a prematurely bald, simplistically drawn guy in a scrappy yellow costume. In a world where giant monsters and supervillains are fond of elaborating on their lengthy back-stories, Saitama has no time for monologuing. ""' I'm Saitama, and I'm a hero for fun"". Like most Shonen heroes he is also absurdly overpowered- so much so in fact, that he is able to fell virtually any enemy in just One Punch-  much to his chagrin. Hence the title, although he is not actually referred to as One Punch Man in the series itself.
Later he encounters a powerful cyborg named Genos who becomes his disciple (despite Saitama's protestations) and encounters the members of the Hero Association and helps fend off alien invaders.
From the moment our hero encounters a rampaging crab-monster who is furious because a young boy drew nipples on him while he slept, it's clear this is not your typical superhero story. For a start, it's very funny, thanks to a constant parade of insane characters and bizarre situations. It also gets a lot of mileage out of how untypical of a hero Saitama is. From his pokey apartment and slovenly lifestyle to his apparent disinterest in justice, he's a long way from your standard Shonen hero. Sure, he wants to become ever more powerful- but only as long as it's fun. His One-Punch ability robs him of the opportunity to enjoy the fight, much this frustration. For him, it's the battle that's more interesting than the result.
The best parodies often come from a place of love and manage to simultaneously make fun of a genre, whilst being part of it. One Punch Man is one such series. Spectacularly well-executed (and well animated) action means this works just as well as a Shonen action series as a comedy. You might think the ""One Punch"" gimmick would get old pretty quick, but the writers were smart enough to make sure this never happens.
Visually, the show is first-rate with Madhouse delivering one of the best-looking anime series of recent years. There's an enjoyable looseness and playfulness to the visuals, confident enough to mix it up and vary the animation style at times. Occasionally, it's reminiscent of a Trigger production. The animation in the set-pieces in the final couple of episodes are particularly impressive.
The only real issue here is some questionable stereotyping based on sexuality and race. The character of Puri Puri Prisoner, for example, plays on some uncomfortable archetypes of sexually predatory gay men. Then again, it also subverts it slightly by making him one of the show's biggest bad-asses.
When the series was first streaming it seemed to be one of the few anime to have real crossover success. It's easy to see why- this is a show with a pretty broad appeal that you don't need to have a particular familiarity with anime to enjoy. Although the more hard-core fans will find plenty of references and homages to enjoy, any superhero fan with a sense of humour should check this out.
IN A NUTSHELL:  Funny, thrilling and a technical Marvel, One Punch Man is a knockout.  ONE PUUUUUUUUUUNCH!",9,NomineMalum

                The first time that I heard about One Punch Man was back when I was getting ready to start my junior year of college. I was always big on anime telling a very unique story that seems too good to be original. Let me just say, this one is perfect.
Saitama seems like a regular guy when you first meet him, and I particularly enjoyed him telling the story as to how he got bald trying to be the strongest man in the universe. What I did not expect is to have 12 episodes telling me how it was possible that he was able to do
                  it with, simply, just one punch.
The more that I watch this anime, the more that I'm happy with the fact that stories like these are appreciated. The interesting thing about the show is the side characters. Gents is only 19 and is also a robot, and the fact that he feels that he can learn from Saitama despite the fact that in the first 5 episodes he feels that he is much stronger than him, shows me that the character development and storyline is not rushed at all. I would watch this story over and over again off of the simple fact that they managed to make one simple character like Saitama feel like an everyday hero to a regular person that might not be as a confident as they think, and that's just a few reasons why I love it. I just can't wait for Season 2.",9,albertbrown
30276,"
                In this absurd parody of superhero stories, our bald hero Saitama has a major problem: no matter how huge or grossly overpowered or disgustingly evolved or city-destroying his opponent is, Saitama can always defeat them with, of course, just one punch.
Together with his cyborg protégé Genos, we follow Saitama and feel his growing frustration with the state of affairs: when he performs an amazing feat, he can get no satisfaction from it because the public and the Hero Association never give him credit for his achievements as a hero. Eventually you do feel really bad for the non-hero public who live in these cities (from
                  “City A”-“City Z”) that are repeatedly invaded by monsters. 
Recommended to fans of anime like Hunter x Hunter, One Punch Man features a cast of colorful characters and a world that gradually grows more complex.
There are also some fantastically funny moments when Saitama is thinking absentmindedly about food in the middle of what would otherwise be intensely serious battles.
This anime was lots of fun and has great potential with its characters’ backstories (like Sonic, an ultrafast ninja criminal), so I hope it will be renewed for more than 12 episodes in the future!",7,shadowfireflame

                Okay, here we go, One Punch Man! One of my favorite anime of all time, for many different reasons. The show isn't deep, obviously, so I'm going to keep this review short, sweet, and to the point.
Story: 8
This is a parody. It's not your deep, psychological anime that really gets into your mind and messes with it. It's about a hero for fun who is the strongest, and there is NO challenge for him! He can kill any villain in just one punch. You'd think it would get old, but... It doesn't. The anime is hilarious and the plot is very creative! And, also, believe
                  it or not, there are quite some serious moments in the anime, and it can get fairly deep.
Art: 10
Wow. Just wow. This is honestly the most beautiful animation and animation style that I have ever seen in an anime, and I've seen some awfully beautiful artwork / styles. Perfection.
Sound: 10
Has some awesome soundtracks that really get one hyped for the show, especially the intro and outro themes! Both the dub and sub are also awesome, so everything just sounds amazing.
Character: 10
Here is one of OPM's strongest areas, no pun intended. The characters. Saitama is probably my favorite superhero in fiction. He's hilarious and awesome at the same time. And all the other main characters, supporting characters, and villains are absolutely awesome. They really made me fall in love with the show fast.
Enjoyment: 10
What can I say? This is probably the funniest anime you will ever watch, and you will have a LOT of fun watching it. Obviously don't expect anything deep. You won't get that here. Just enjoy, laugh at the jokes, and enjoy the epic and comical fights!
Overall: 10
I cannot wait until Season 2. I'm sure I'm just going to like it even more once it's out. This show is fairly similar to DBZ in a sense, but it doesn't have plot-holes, continuity errors, and isn't long and drawn out. This anime is like watching the most beautiful firework show and not knowing what to say except ""Oooooo... Ahhhhhh!""",10,SixLeafCloverOF
30276,"
                One Punch Man is a classic.
The main reason why I say this is the fact that I think OPM holds itself up in a way where it shouldn't be taken too seriously, this is an anime based off the web-comic created by ONE who did Mob Psycho 100. The anime is basically this ball of making fun of shonen tropes and just overall being ridiculous, and yes, this season probably covers most, if not, every shonen trope you can think of and makes fun of it.
The anime tells its story in a way that isn't ""Haha, sad backstory go brr"" it uses trope-like elements and
                  just creates a good story, One Punch Man isn't deep, its just a silly story of a guy who is way too powerful.
Story:
Alright, we have the story of a man named Saitama. a character who saves a kid from this crab-person and decides that he is going to be a hero, sounds tropey enough but here's the catch. Saitama becomes too powerful and doesn't have enjoyment since he kills everything in one punch.
Art:
The art isn't the best from design, Saitama isn't drawn straight and looks rather silly at times but he does have an art change to where he looks a lot more better, its like a Dragon Ball character in a sense which is exactly what the series sort-of makes fun of on the first episodes. The other characters like Genos, Tatsumaki, and Bang are drawn pretty well. Do not get me started on the animation, good god, its so good.
Sound: 
The sound effects in this anime are amazing, I loved hearing the music and just the thought that was put into this anime, experience it for yourself, its really nice.
Character:
I can't name a character I don't like, Saitama is literally a spirit animal, Genos is a ridiculous yet loveable cyborg, Tatsumaki is just an angry tornado woman, I could continue on about the characters honestly.
Other Notes:
I had a lot of enjoyment with this anime, it's pretty nice and I would give it a 10 but it's not my favorite of all time, its just a nice anime to watch when you're sick of shonen tropes and just want something that isn't completely serious but follows kind-of a shonen formula

                Intro
One Punch Man, a show that follows the heroics and hilarities of a man that can beat all of his opponents in one punch. 
A lot of people like to describe the show as a parody. Well, I don't think that at all. The show is what it is, the best action anime of all time. ""How is beating everything in one punch serious?"" One might ask, and I would answer by telling them to actually pay attention to the show. It's a story of a man who had nothing, literally a guy who is a failure, and worked hard enough to the point where
                  he broke his limiter and became the strongest being in the universe. This is literally about how hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard, just like them majority of other shounen. Now, the official show/manga/web serial is set after this point, but it is still apparent in the show by looking at every single hero character. They have something that Saitama never had, talent. They were born with their powers or had a freak accident happen to them, they didn't work for it. Even the disciple Genos was built in a lab by a mad scientist. And as a result, they take it for granted and think of themselves as superior to the average man, or everyone really. I'll touch further how it isn't a simple exaggeration of shounen, or parody, throughout the review.
Story
So, the story itself is pretty simple. It is more or less a monster of the week type of gig, but it also stresses heavily on certain themes of society. 
The biggest one being the true facet of human nature. Most people, even though they may have everything to begin with, will step on others if it means furthering their own agenda. 
Another good theme that is present is not to judge a book by it's cover. Yeah, Saitama is a guy with a generic cape and has a chrome dome, and is often discredited because of it, but in reality he is the equivalent of God. Whereas every single other character has over the top, extravagant character design and is only really average. There will be a scene that is coming up in the anime that will highlight this exact thing. You'll know it when you see it. 
The last one is what it means to be a hero. Most of these characters do the hero thing to become strong enough to get revenge, to gain popularity or fame, or whatever else furthers their agenda. Whereas Saitama does it because he truly wants to help people, even if it means that the people he is saving will see him as a monster, or a cheat. It is truly inspiring. Going back to intro, all of these things don't sound like an exaggeration of shounen at all. 
As you can see, despite beating everything in one punch, there still lies a lot of inner/between character conflict going on that keeps it interesting. I've never seen a PARODY that was able to do that in anything.
The only comedy is the gag that Saitama as a very ""don't care"" attitude. Especially in the face of these gargantuan and all-powerful monsters. This has verying amount of intended comic effect.
Art
For those not acquainted, the story designer under the pen name ONE wrote the story as a web serial. After gaining world wide recognition, Young Jump Studios went to him and said more or less ""This is one of the best stories in the industry... But, your talent for art sucks ass. How about we make a deal where we pair you up with the best artist in the industry and get this out to a wider audience?"" That's how the manga was created. The anime takes from the art work and linear story line of the manga, and not the web serial (Which is a good thing, trust me). So naturally, the art work is beautiful. There are some truly breath taking scenes that capture the bad assery of Saitama.
Sound
The background music go perfectly with each scene to help capture it's mood. The OP is one of the best OP's ever. That's really all I can say about it.
Character
I spoke a little of character design a little bit ago, so let me go into detail.
We have Saitama, which I described as a ""Caped Baldy"" which is really exactly what he looks like. Very misleadingly unspecial. This is constantly touched on. He first describes his heroing as just a hobby that soon starts to bore him because nothing is a challenge anymore. Later, he decides that helping people his all the matters, regardless of the circumstances. Despite his God tier abilities, he remains humble. Which is very unlike a lot of other characters. Now that I'm thinking about it, it is actually because he looks so generic that makes him so special.
Next, we have Genos. He is described as a ""Demon Cyborg"" and that is exactly his character design. He almost died and wants revenge on the person who destroyed his village. To do this, he wants to become ever more powerful. He starts out arrogant like the others, but becomes humbled as he is really one of the only people that witnesses Saitama's amazingness.
There are tons of other side characters, and they all have fantastic character design. But, have not been given too much detail in the anime, so I can't really talk about them. They are usually in heroing business for themselves and are arrogant and very ironically not hero like. 
Enjoyment
I'm pretty sure I've said multiple times that I believe One Punch Man to be the best action anime of all time. This is without bias, considering that minutes 18-19 in the FIRST episode had more action than all of the Dragon Ball franchise combined. With bias, I believe it to be the best action anything that will ever exist. The never ending bad assery of Saitama is something that I will never get over, and I've followed the web serial since '09. 
Overall
I think that you can guess how good the series is by now if you've read up to this point. So, I won't bother. I'll just say one thing in conclusion, and that is that despite the main character beating everything in one punch, that is really the only parody in the story. And that fact can easily be discredited by the fact that it is used to further the plot and is the focal point of all the conflict in the story. 
So, I'll say it again. It is NOT a parody or anything to be taken lightly.",10,DoYouEvenRunBro

                How would you feel if you were Vegeta and suddenly transported to another world where the strongest fighter was but an ordinary human? Dragonball metaphors aside, how boring would it be if you could literally defeat, or rather obliterate, anybody with a single punch? One Punch Man explores this idea as the protagonist, Saitama, and other heroes work to battle hordes of strong but rather forgettable antagonists.
I watched this show on a whim for two reasons. First, there was an interesting cross between One Punch Man and Dragonball that I found rather amusing. Second, I wondered how they could make a show out of something
                  that sounds like it would get boring really fast. It seems that at least from an action standpoint, they have you covered.
Animation:
The animation score will definitely vary based on the viewer. If one expects intricate details and choreography as in Unlimited Budget Works, cough FSN, then they'd be pretty disappointed here. However, compared to the author's original web comic this is quite a few levels up. The story takes place in a rather casually named City Z, which along with a bunch of other lettered cities are often under attack by various enemies of humanity. Expect generic landscape that reminisces of the backgrounds in early Japanese renditions of Godzilla or Ultraman. A good deal of emphasis is placed on the various heroes, contrasting the cool and focused look of Genos with the plain and rather blase look of Saitama. While Genos would pass as a fine protagonist in many other shows, One Punch Man is rather unique for adapting such a plain and simple character as the lead.
A large portion of the show consists of action sequences showing various heroes fight random antagonists, often to be defeated after an arduous struggle. This is where Saitama often steps in, quickly finishing the antagonist and proceeding to go home. Basically, the show gets away with entertaining you mostly with fights between antagonists and other heroes, like Genos, rather than the main protagonist. This kind of makes sense as otherwise the episodes would be like five minutes each in length. The contrast between Saitama and the other heroes also shows in their fighting style. Whereas the other heroes use very flashy moves or weapons (such as Katanas, baseball bats, mechs, telepathy, etc.) Saitama uses his ""normal punch."" The irony is that the flashy moves and weapons often have little impact on the antagonist while Saitama's punch turns the antagonist into gory pieces of flesh. Yes, expect a fair amount of gore as antagonist and Genos are both often torn to pieces.
Sound:
The show starts with a guy fitting screaming ""One Punch"" followed by a heavy rock piece; it's not my choice type of music but fitting considering the crazy action nature of the show. The ED is more of a cool down piece though it doesn't really tie in to the show. The BGM was fittingly engaging though no particular melody stood out.
This mostly-male cast does a fitting job giving life to the various personalities of the heroes. Kaito Ishikawa does a good job of giving Genos a cool vibe, despite the number of times he gets trashed. Though honestly, I was most surprised at how convincingly Aoi Yuuki does her tsundere role.
Story:
This isn't a terribly complicated story, and really one of those where attempting to rationalize what is happening will only end up killing your brain cells.
So there are these cities that somehow deal with continuous bloody massacres and are tasked with funding gargantuan reconstructions. Somehow, the people of these cities are stupid enough to continue living in these easy to attack places where likewise brainless antagonists show up looking to just terrorize society. Luckily, the stupid people are stupid enough to somehow fund/support a Hero's Association that dispatches various heroes to deal with threats. Heroes and villains are both classified based on supposed ability and risk, respectively. Often, the stupid bureaucrats of the association underestimate the ability of the antagonists and end up with weak-sauce heroes valiantly being defeated, only to be ironically saved by the lowly-ranked Saitama.
What it really comes down to is a relatively episodic progression that does get a bit repetitive; an antagonist appears, heroes are sent and defeated, Saitama comes in and one-punches his way to the ED. This rather boring baseline is spiced up by changing up the heroes and antagonists that show up and by attempting to weave in some themes in the story. For instance, there is a rather ironic comparison between Saitama's simplicity (not to mention his rather simple routine to get strong) and the complexity of all the other heroes. There is the blatant poke at bureaucratic infighting and the ""image"" of a hero. And there's Saitama's rationale for being a hero- not for fame, not for fortune, just cause it's something he wants to do.
In summary, your mileage will depend heavily on what you're looking for in the show. If you're looking for a contiguous plot with a point to it all, you're going to be rather disappointed.
Character:
While I will give credit for developing Genos and Saitama, there isn't really any level of depth with any of the other characters. Some of the supporting characters, such as Onsoku no Sonic, are developed to an extend only to be completely unused later in the show. Don't even get me started on the throwaway antagonists. There is some creativity in uniting heroes of various levels of ability (I thought Kamen Rider was particularly humorous) but that's really about it. Furthermore, disregarding Genos' multiple upgrades, all of the characters are totally static- it's all just interactions (mostly with fists) rather than development and growth.
Value:
If you're looking to scratch an action itch and don't really a detailed or explicated story line, by all means knock yourself out (pun intended) with this work. If you're looking for something with some depth to it, this might not be your choice show. That said, the base content is quite enjoyable if you ignore the multitude of unanswered plot holes and cookie cutter characters and antagonists. I'd still consider this more of a shonen work than a seinin piece. It's not the next DBZ and not quite the same kind of satisfaction as something like Birdy Decode or Gurren Lagann, but it's still an impressive work considering the origins of the source material (if you have no idea what I'm talking about you should read up about the author). At the least, it helps the rather lackluster diversity of anime works coming from Japan recently.",6,Zaku88

                Ive got to say this is a really good Anime through and through. 
I definitely recommend!!!
This is a very good anime and i got to say everything about it is amazing. Firstly i think that the main character is really funny. I think that  the amount of humor in this anime is immaculate. I love that art style and I love the story line!! Watching this anime had me at the edge of my seat, and laughing hysterically. I love this anime and i love the little details that are out into it. I fell like this is one of my favorite animes and
                  if your looking for a funny, emotionally charged, different, and overall amazing anime, I would recommend one punch man!!",9,SpIcYsAuCe3223

                For me, the first time watching One Punch Man, I knew the series was not meant to be taken seriously because who in the hell would seriously develop a character that defeats anything with one punch, where's the thrill in that? So it would make sense that the show was simply there for the fun of it and for people to waste some time. But as I watch on, I realized that even though One Punch Man has a very simple storyline, there are times in the book/anime that teaches real lessons. Although simple, OPM, manages to be complex. 
I would say this anime is
                  for people who want something light to watch. Something to chill with in bed at 3 am when you're awake with nothing to do.",8,Umasou_007
30276,"
                One Punch Man doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 
Thing is, that's the point. 
They never tried to make an anime where you build up a close bond with all of its characters or anything. If you're watching One Punch Man, you're probably there for some amazing fight scenes, with a few laughs along the way.
One Punch Man knocks both of those out of the park.
They almost give a John Wick-esque (if John Wick were also a comedy, at least) feeling to Saitama from the very first episode, which sets the expectations very well for the series. This way, you already know the end
                  result of each fight - you just don't know how it's going to get there. But trust, the path to that inevitable ending will always look stellar. And it does - every single time.
The humour in this show may or may not land as well as the action does, depending on your taste in humour, but for me, it hit more than it missed.
The story of One Punch Man isn't anything to write home about. You probably won't remember any character outside of Saitama a week after watching it.
But you probably will remember a series that knew its story was dumb, and embraced it - all while having some of the most visually spectacular fight scenes in anime.
Who knew a single punch could be so entertaining?",8,theprocrastinaut

                Is it fair to give a show a relatively high score only because it is better than the shows that air alongside it? To anyone it has been common knowledge for the past few years, that new anime are not as good as the old classics. With more than half of the new shows coming out being terrible comedies with a bunch of weebs being their target audience. 
So, when a show comes out that goes completely against the norm, and showcases a new ingenious idea, that is actually entertaining and can be analysed with more praise than critique, do we automatically start calling it
                  the greatest of all time? Start giving it perfect scores? ""Saviour of Anime""? Don't we all rank this show on the same list that we ranked the best of the best. The same list on which we ranked Gintama, Full Metal, Steins;Gate? Is this show really worth a 10/10 on that same list ?
Unarguably not. One Punch Man was unique, it had an amazing production value, the characters were brilliant, but it is nowhere near a perfect score, not even a strong 80%. For a few reasons. It has major story flaws, major pacing problems, major character development problems, etc. All of which should be avoided when thinking about 'the best' show. 
The One Punch Man anime aired for 12 episodes and the manga is still going with multiple volumes, yet the show doesn't sway away from the one same joke it always uses. Which in itself makes this no different than the close minded anime about a dense dude and his harem. That being said, the joke itself is a creative one and enjoyable, if it didn't occur in every single episode. 
But if that's all that One Punch Man was, it would be worth of a <5 score, however One Punch Man doesn't only use the idea of the One Punch as a joke but also adds some depth and a tremendous amount of epicness. With the beautiful animation, amazing soundtrack and outstanding cinematography it makes the One Punch better than any other multi episode fight. 
Now many people like to claim that One Punch Man isn't meant to be analysed critically because it is a show that doesn't try to be in detail or in depth. I would argue against that. I think that One Punch Man was intended to do just that but in an unorthodox way. And I am fully aware that the original author didn't have big plans for it, but is clear from the mood it sets that it does take itself and the plot it contains very seriously.  You can tell this by looking at how it never jeopardizes certain story lines for cheap comedy or for the sake of temporary sub plots. Not to mention it also has scenes where the characters are actually trying to be politically and morally correct. Though, it's as about as serious as an anime can get. 
Story: 6/10
In a fools point of view, One Punch Man's story only revolves around finding new villains and waiting for our hero to come and save them. This of course kills all suspense that can be created with hyped up villains or their feats. It does in the first few times add a sense of suspense on whether the enemy is going to get One Punched or not, that perhaps has our main character met his match. For this 12 episode run, that can only be said about 1 or 2 villains out of the many many. 
This point of view is foolish because it doesn't see the new major plotlines that each story arc unveils. From the time the main characters become official heroes, to the time of them ranking up, or meeting other strong and relevant super heroes. This sense of new things happening can and does make One Punch Man an engaging show. Except for one problem. The pacing. In the 12 episode run we got introduced to tons of interesting characters. Characters that could have a successful anime of their own, but One Punch Man only goes as far as introducing them. Hyping them up, but never doing anything significant with them. This I also felt was a problem in one of the greatest anime of all time, Hunter x Hunter, but because of the simple difference in run time even Hunter x Hunter eventually reached a point where it had to climax the hype it had built up. One Punch Man never did. It can actually be said that it started downplaying the hype near the end, where some of the more relevant characters get reduced to doing inferior tasks. 
It has a common discussion among the internet that One Punch Man is a parody of all shonen anime as it attempts to do the exact opposite of the typical 'never give up' scenario. I can neither agree nor disagree to this statement because I think that the authors original intent is a determining factor. Though I can say that it did not appeal to me as such. It was more of a show that is trying to convey something simple while doing it in an exaggerated method. Perhaps the trait of never being satisfied with what you have or not worrying about how others view your actions only how you do? To each their own I suppose, but those things are clear themes in the One Punch Anime. Which is another reason I would argue that One Punch Man is not a 'turn your brain off'  anime. This and also because, if you do decide to pay attention to detail you will slowly loose track of the story, with the vast amounts of characters being introduced every now and then, with each having a role in the bigger picture. Lagging attention will prevent you from keeping up with most of them. 
Characters: 8/10 
There are a few character names in One Punch Man that a viewer will actually remember. The important main characters, the characters who have obvious names relating to their superpowers or your random favourite character. That limits the number of memorable characters to extremely little compared to the amount of potentially good characters in the show. The show introduces a massive amount of characters, each with their own names, super powers and unique design. Each with their own allegiances, roles and enemies. Yet more than half, or rather 90% of these characters appear for a fraction of episodes. Even some of the important, high ranked individuals only appeared for a maximum of 10 minutes in the entire show. 
The main characters however also get less screen time than usual. This is because though the side character get little to no appearances, there are so many that it adds up and cuts away from the main characters time to shine. The main character usually appears at the end of an episode to finish off the bad guy while his side kick come during the middle and attempts at fighting the villain. 
Talking about the side kick. One of the most interesting characters in the show, who had a flashback that was only teased in the anime, and has only been mention once or twice in the Jump manga, is treated far too unjustly. He has lots of potential to become one of the leading stars of the show yet is turned into a ploy for the animators to animate an actual fight, as he gets utterly destroyed by almost all bad guys. 
Also the use of anime tropes to quickly develop a certain character in One Punch Man is not a rarity. From overpowered old dudes, to loyal samurai, to whiny lolis and everything else, One Punch Man uses the fact that we know the character traits of certain types of character tropes in anime, to not develop the character as an individual. This is not always a bad strategy, as it is effective, but it takes so much away from the character that I would want to see be important one day, if madhouse ever makes a sequel. 
Like I mentioned before, the music in One Punch Man really does build up tense moments in which failure seems inevitable, but that feeling can only last for the first few episodes, until you realize that the main character will literally One Punch, anything and everything. But the interesting thing about this is that, One Punch Man actually does go out of its way in letting us know that he actually can't One Punch all his problems away, that sometimes he needs to use his wit for situations that can't be solved with strength. But that aspect was visited once briefly and never again, but nonetheless did help with some great character development.
The characters in One Punch Man can at most times be flat characters because of how little we see of most of them. The main character I can safely say for sure is a flat character, but soo much potential to change. If he ever goes through something that can change him as a person, and it is legitimate, it could make for one of the best anime moments of all time, but that's just my wishful thinking. 
Production: 10/10
Everyone's favourite, Madhouse delivers yet again. With some of the best animation in anime existence and an amazing sound track, One Punch Man has one of the highest production values of all time. It makes watching the show exponentially more entertaining. The way each keyframe is animated for big moments, is so smooth and done without much help from CGI effects resulting in a beautiful motion picture. Most of the fights that actually take place, are animated beautifully with much thought put into each movement to make it as dynamic as possible. 
There are some scenes with some of the best cinematography I have ever scene in anime. The usage of lighting and still images along side of battle effects and sparky anime colours was done so well, that you can't even complain about the characters being too colourful. 
All in all, I have no complaints with how Madhouse handled the production of this show, with the exception of how the transferred it from the original source material. But it's unfair to judge a show based on how it compares to the source material, so lets leave it at that. 
Enjoyment and Overall Score: 8/10 
One Punch Man is a nice breather from the below average shows we get in anime lately, but it is no where near the best show to ever exist or even the top 20 or 30. It was entertaining. It wasn't a show that I would go out of my to watch again nor was it a show that I really looked forward to all that much, other than waiting for the manga scenes to be animated. The anime community rode it's hype train because it has a large manga fanbase, it was leaps and bounds above average animation and sound, which leads to any onlooker being interested in it. That being said, I think it was overhyped, but I have no problem with that. It's nice to see people enjoy something that much every now and then, especially if that something is not Sword Art Online, but rather a relatively good show. I do however have a problem with it being so high in the Top Anime of this website, beating anime that are far better than it, when I know that most of the high scores are given with only hype in mind.

                SSSSSSPOILEERSSSSSSSS
Yeah, yeah, the animation is really, really, REALLY good, but the history is nothing of another world. It's just a common fight shonen story, but with a character thats ridiculously powerful, yeah, that makes it better than generic shonen stories (Yeah, now I know that the anime is a seinen, lol) , but it's not enough. The secondary characters are plain as always, and the show is so desperate to make a joke about how Saitama doesn't fit in this generic super hero world, that the characters will keep like that, like generic shonen characters. Genos could perfectly be the protagonist, and the show will
                  have nothing special. The only thing that makes it different from another shows, is Saitama. BUT, despite all, I must say that the designs of the character are very well done.
The comedy is good, just that, didn't fell of mi chair with any of the jokes.
Leaving the story and the characters apart, the show works very well like bombastic mindless action, and the animation just makes it better.
If you come to this series expecting a deep and complex history, you are very lost. Now, if you came, wanting to see espectacular action, a perfect animation, a seinen that looks like a shonen but it's not, and thats not so generic, you came to the right show.

                I thought this anime deserves a review.
More than being a mere satire/comedy stunt aiming to get a few laughs off you, One Punch Man has some serious society and Heroes' cliches criticism. Much of it is more subtle than what some seem to be expecting, but I have given it a 10 because of it. For example how Saitama is clearly doing all the work but is never recognized by it because of ""hero association rules"" that sometimes make no sense. All the bickering between heroes with poor moral value, but since they prize appearances they are praised as incredible by society. It does not
                  go deep in these issues as it keeps the satirical tone through, but it has a good balance of both.
I could go on if I were to list all the little things that are in this, but, suffice to say, there is much more to One Punch Man than just a laugh machine, and this, is the best type of comedy and satire :)",10,Gwennyth
30276,"
                My point of view going into this anime: I DID NOT WATCH ONE PUNCH MAN IN HOPES OF FINDING AN AMAZING ACTION STORY. Tbh, I wasn't going to watch it at all, but my boyfriend swore by it and as a person into psychology/anthropology it would've felt hypocritical to write it off without a 2nd opinion.
Story: So the title couldn't be anymore self-explanatory; a hero who defeats all his enemies with a PUNCH. For those who complained about Saitama being overpowered and the plot not being complex enough....I really don't know what to say to you!!! Oh wait, yes I do; DUH!!! I may have
                  over-read it, but I saw this anime as one giant heap of satire. Just kinda took all the things that people correlate in action, superhero shows and gave it one good punch!! Rather than watching it for a good story, I watched it because I like to laugh and I felt like channeling my inner tomboyish child who was very much into action and superhero shows that had little to no impressive plot, and it's felt nice.
Art: Nothing stood out, nothing was too bad. But there were certain designs and animation I personally felt correlated well with the situation.
Sound: One Punch Man's soundtrack and opening are one of the most popular. I've heard people yell ""One Puuuuuuuunch!!"" at the top of their lungs but could not tell me what anime it came from. I don't think it's over-hyped, the soundtrack and opening go well with the anime's theme and makes me feel invigorated or bada*** whenever I listen to it.
Character: Although many of the supporting characters are stereotypical or just goofy altogether, I didn't see a big problem in it since I wasn't expecting any masterpiece-like character development. My main attention was pointed towards Speed of Sound Sonic (for...biased and baseless purposes XD) and Saitama. Saitama wasn't your average hero which gave the anime its satirical demeanor.",7,CHLO_JO007

                So this show is a thing. I didn’t really know what to expect from a show whose basic premise is that the lead character is so powerful that he literally destroys his enemies with a single punch. I mean, doesn’t that make for awfully boring fight scenes? They’ll be over in seconds and there can be no doubt about the outcome or clever tactics to achieve it. And that is broadly true of the series. The only way they can have their long drawn-out anime fight scenes is by having Saitama absent or just presenting a horde of faceless goons. The secondary cast is likeable
                  enough that you worry about them in a way you never worry about Saitama. And they have a series of hilariously ridiculous reasons for keeping Saitama away, ranging from a sale at his favorite grocery store to getting lost in the villain’s lair.
But the fact that they need to come up with these inventive reasons just underscores how limiting a factor Saitama’s nigh invulnerability is. It would be a pretty stupid feature to have if it served no narrative purpose. Fortunately, they get a lot of mileage out of Saitama’s boredom with life. His motivation to be a hero isn’t to save the world or anything, he does it as a hobby. Which means that the ability to defeat anyone in a single punch is immensely frustrating. Unsurprisingly, this makes him rather eccentric and gives him a skewed set of priorities. His extreme competence at beating people up is matched only by his inability to do anything else. He knows nothing about how superhero society works and doesn’t even have a basic curiosity about his surroundings. In general, he’s a mundane guy who cares most about the boring everyday tasks of life.
With a detached and unmotivated hero as the lead the sidekick is obviously going to serve as his motivation and foil. And Genos doesn’t disappoint. A teenage cyborg with a laser arm, he takes life and superheroing immensely seriously, often copying down every word his master says as if it contains profound wisdom. He also has a tendency to overexplain everything and confuse his simpleminded mentor. They don’t really do much with Genos yet in terms of driving the plot. I suspect that next season will see more of this.
This series is just plain fun. Saitama is a great character and the supporting cast is fun too. The situations are completely ridiculous and the parody elements are funny. But it also works well as action scenes.",10,ArchStanton

                I will write this little review to the people that are planning to watch this anime.
This one really caught my attention when I first heard about it. I've watched it over 8 times already and there is not a single time where I don't enjoy watching it. The story is very simple and it is mainly explained on the first two chapters. The protagonist is hilarious.

                ""Mosquitoes... suck!""
Most Shounen anime are riddled with cliches and the overall 'OP MC' trope. But what if you make the character too OP? That's where One Punch Man comes in, minus the cliches.
Story: 7/10
Rather than be a story focusing on one main goal, One Punch Man doesn't focus on any of this and rather focuses on single episode arcs or dual episode arcs (apart from the last arc which took 3 episodes). The comedy is greatly sustained and I found myself laughing at one moment then kind of serious in the next. I have a lot of praise for the last arc. Being a person
                  for whom the last arc and the ending is absolutely necessary for the overall enjoyment, the last arc totally satisfied me. I had a lot of fun watching it since it had the suspense in it, the comedy, the basic easygoing pace felt throughout the anime. Like I mentioned before, One Punch Man isn't your typical rushy type action anime where stuff happens left and right and there's no relaxing time, One Punch Man goes the extra mile and makes you feel relaxed DURING the serious moments. Nothing was rushed and I applaud Madhouse for excellently handling the pace of the anime, not too fast and a bit slow so everyone can enjoy, YET a lot is covered in terms of story.
Art: 9/10
Although I'm guilty of giving out more 9s in art in my reviews, I've been quite stubborn in giving out full-on 10s and I feel One Punch Man definitely deserved it. It's action sequences were perfectly done and even in measly 480p you could sense the greatness going on. The choreography as well was nicely done and it seemed as the sky was the limit for the art section. Definitely a 10 from me. It was amazing how they balanced Saitama's serious face and his comic face so well that it made me think why other action comedies can't do so easily.
Sound: 6/10
The OP. I think that's enough of a thing to mull over. It pumped and hyped you up so well and obviously it was perfect for One Punch Man. I liked the ED a lot but more than once felt as if it didn't suit the anime. With romantic lyrics I felt as if it's obviously more suited towards some high school romance anime and not an action one. Regardless it was still a great song with a good beat but in the end due to it's unrelated status to the anime and plot it was a problem, not to mention the forgettable soundtrack.
Character: 6/10
Apart from a few outside characters (mainly the villains) the main characters didn't develop much, by who I mean Saitama and Genos. They were the main characters and they didn't improve much from the second episode till the last apart from a few minor developments. In spite of that, from the start they were decently characterized which might explain why they weren't developed much over the course of the anime. Saitama was a person who wanted to be a hero for fun and it was literally fun seeing how his daily life went about. Even though he was a 'hero' he was very relatable as a character. Sadly that can't be said much of Genos, he felt........... Robotic... Ok jokes aside I seriously meant that, since this was a 12 episode anime Genos' backstory wasn't explored as deeply as Saitama's (heck, the only backstory Saitama had was his hair in episode 1) and though he was the second character still felt that he could have been more developed. 
Enjoyment: 8/10
It was a blast watching One Punch Man. It was funny and it got serious when it had to be. I felt 12 episodes were less for the story but it was fun while it lasted. It's been a long time since I had fun watching an all-action anime since my last one Gintama isn't as action focused as you may think in contrast with One Punch Man and it felt awesome watching a guy stronger than SuperMan in such comedic situations. Definitely one of my favorites!
Overall: 7/10 (Averaged)
Overall One Punch Man is an anime that's perfect for you if you love a bit of action with a huge dipping of Comedy as well. It makes you laugh, go ""woah"", put you into nail biting situations leaving you at the edge of your seat and certainly leaves you satisfied at the end. Not to mention that last arc was epic, if you like me find the ending the most important thing in an anime, you certainly won't be disappointed. With season 2 coming out next year I am hyped but am trying to keep expectations down because  staff has taken over the helm for the sequel and even though they're my favorite anime studio I'm kinda skeptical if they can succeed over such a great prequel at first since as far as I know J.C isn't cut out to be an action anime pro as how Madhouse was. But anyway, let's keep our chins up and hope the sequel is as great as this was, if not greater.

                Ah, One-Punch Man, known for his finishing move beating any enemies with just one punch (a joke, must be, hahaha, well not...). Generally people will find this Marvelous show very refreshing and funny. Interesting I say, how a bald hero named Saitama beat the menacing Villans. It's super easy, just swing your hand and it's over. But the real problem is that this hero of ours, has run out of joke, it's just about swing, swing, and swing, initially it's funny, but it's become repetitive and boring. This guy has no weakness, probably he's god himself (*spoiler: he kicks the supreme ruler-of-universe's ass with just
                  half-baked blows, and finishes him off with once again, ONE SWING!) Whoa! Ain't that amazing?? Well, yeah, in fact it's too amazing to even mention about. But that's all, one swing and it's done. If you love SWINGS, you gotta watch this, Hyped-Mode. But unfortunately not all people are into such repetitive and overrated scenes, I am one of those outsiders by the way. A hero with no flaw, wow! And he's a man? Whoa!!??!? That must be a god! Ah...! I know, the title's been fooling us all this time, it's not One-Punch Man, it's One-Punch God! Now that sounds better, hahaha. Well, just so that this doesn't look like an entirely left-handed review, there are indeed some moments in the show that can tear apart our human feelings, like when a certain inferior hero tries to stop an overpowered villain, when our favorite bald hero gets blamed for destroying things even though he's just saved an entire population from a disaster, or when he can't even kill a bug (now this is real funny). Overall, aside of all left-handed things I've mentioned, most people will find this show awe-inspiring and probably their favorite anime of the year. Some minor with post-modernism mind may loathe this piece of work. I'm not really into heroic stuff, but the fact that I've finished watching One-Punch God, ehm... *cough* One-Punch Man is a proof that I indeed enjoyed this show to the end. If you're picky eater, please don't watch this. Thank you, may this little-valued guide help you, even if it's just a very small bit of information",5,Stelvedorn

                Behold: the first 10 I give to an anime that is ~NOT~ from my childhood!!! WHAT SORCERY IS THIS?????
Simple: One Punch Man is just THAT good. I couldn't find a single bad thing about it.
It's fun, it's funny, the art is awesome, every character is a parody of something (or even some sort of hero/villain stereotype) and yet they're interesting, it's just... it's absolutely amazing.
You'd think that a story about a hero that easily kills his enemies wouldn't be fun, right? But oh, you're so wrong!
While there's battles and the whole ""earth needs to be saved"" shtick, I believe the main genre in this anime
                  is comedy. And it does it very well.
My only small complaint is that the only woman I've seen so far is Tornado. Sure, she's awesome (I already love her!), but it wouldn't hurt to have more kickass female characters, right?
Besides that, this is easily a 10/10",10,isahbellah

                I wasn't a fan of the storyline. I did like Saitama and Genos, though, and that's what kept me here.
Story: 6 for Fair
I kept falling asleep while watching this. The script was good. There were some chuckles from me. But almost every episode was the same:
Villain! A fight! Winning! Discipling! Something ominous! Developing as a hero!
That's all there was. The plotline of their becoming heroes was interesting. But I wasn't a big fan of the fights or the progression or anything.Art: 7 for Good
I liked the variety of angles. At times, it was hard to see what was going on, but that's what a fight is.
Sound: 7 for Good
I liked the music in this series, especially songs in episodes 11 and 12.
Character: 7 for Good
For me, this was the anime's strongest point. I liked Saitama and Genos as characters. There's all these quirks to both, and their bond was interesting. It didn't feel rushed either: I understood why Genos followed Saitama, and Saitama was nice enough to him.
Enjoyment and Overall: 7 for Good
I enjoyed the script and laughed at a few jokes. I wonder if I would enjoy this series more if I knew about the superhero genre in anime, since I've read that this is a parody of it. I found the fight scenes a bit dry. Side characters were annoying and I never felt upset at the demise of anyone. Genos and Saitama are cool with me.
If you're thinking about watching One Punch Man, give it a try, why not? Plenty of people like this series. I would definitely watch a second one because I'm curious as to what happens next. I'm also curious to see the development of Saitama and Genos' friendship. 
But I do feel like this series has been a bit overhyped with ratings of 10.",7,numbersixes

                Hands down one of the best animes I've ever watched. The art style, the animation, the characters, everything seems to just work really well together in this anime. Madhouse and its animators should've been animating Season 2 too! But I'll get to that later below..
When I watch animes, I'm usually really observant and if something weird pops up like a weird punchline or a cringe-attempt at a joke, I would usually remember it and bash on it at the end of its episode that it occurred in. 
But there wasn't any of that in this anime; that's how enjoyable it was for me to watch
                  it. The fight scenes were glorious and beautifully animated, every scene that was meant to be funny either made me chuckle out loud or laughed a lot, and the characters were memorable enough that I could almost list all of them that were present in Season 1 just by sheer memory (even though it's been 2 years!)
This is all great. 
What worries me the most is probably OPM's future, that is: Season 2. 
Season 2 is not animated by Madhouse, but it will be by a studio called J.C. Staff that many people (including me) are very skeptical about. They mainly animate Rom-Coms with a bunch of fillers and simple plot and this worries me greatly. I really hope they live up to the fans expectations.

                I'm not actually sure what all the rage was about this show. One Punch man is a fairly average show.
It works as a comedy, but the action isn't all that great, and I suppose that's to be expected with a guy that finishes his enemies with one punch. There's also a noticeable drop in the quality of the artwork whenever there's any intense levels of animation.
There is one caveat I have with the story though. If you go to school for physics for instance, the university will not expect you to have strong writing skills, so it sort of didn't work for me when Saitama
                  was given a rank C for turning in a bad written report. Especially when he outclassed other heroes by a wide margin. It was a really silly choice.
I don't really have much else to say other than I found it to be a rather average show. There was nothing that really blew me away.",7,carnage_panda

                I personally think that this anime is truly enjoyable. However it lacks key concepts.
Story line- This anime is based on two things fighting and being the strongest.
Personally I believe that this is kind of basic. Each episode is basically one huge fight after another.  
Character development- LITTLE TO NONE. There was one brief episode about why things happen. As a viewer I felt that everything was overall so simple that after a while everything became predictable.   
Sound & Art- Both decent 
Enjoyment- There is plenty of comedic point in each episode.
Overall- The anime is simply simple. Maybe that's why people like or hate it",6,daisyfang4

                When a friend first told me about this anime and manga, I was hesitant to give it a shot because it sounded ridiculously stupid or amazingly brilliant. Twelve episodes of the anime later, I still can't tell you which it is. 
Story: The concept is original, there's no doubt about it. As the title clearly states, each episode ends with ""one punch"". If you're freaking out right now because I've just given a major spoiler, then you'll be sorely disappointed when you watch the show, because it's mostly anti-climatic. BUT, that's the point. One Punch Man is parody and satire at its best. I've been
                  told I have a cheesy kind of humour, so maybe enjoyment from this show hinges upon my kind of humour. I was literally laughing out loud watching this anime. 
Art: The original manga was drawn purposely simple and lackluster. Upon its recreation, it was drawn beautifully and the anime as well, EXCEPT for Saitama's face, which is kept in its original comically plain state. At first, I doubted if I could watch a whole series with such a funny looking (and unattractive) protagonist, but I came to love Saitama, even with his stupid-looking face. And Saitama aside, everyone else is beautiful. 
Character: You don't really get to know the characters very well, but they are all very interesting. There are quite a number of them but the story doesn't dwell on them individually. Generally speaking, you meet someone, learn their rank/abilities, and then may or may not see them reappear in another episode. 
Enjoyment: Depending on your humour, you're either going to laugh along and find the whole idea brilliant, or you're going to drop the anime, finding it ridiculous. Personally, I enjoyed it and would recommend that you at least give it a solid try.
Bottom line: One Punch Man isn't for everyone. You're either going to find it funny or not. Try at least two episodes. The concept is truly refreshing and unique.",9,citycat

“In exchange for power, maybe I’ve lost something that’s essential for a human being?” — Saitama.  
In honor of staying consistent with breaking tradition (as One Punch Man often does) I will end my review here……
”OK.”
Joking aside, allow me to construct an argument explaining my reasons for giving this anime a perfect 10/10.
Shounen anime has gained a reputation, perhaps deservingly so, of opting for grand visual displays over stimulating plots and character progression (style over substance, as it were).  The classic road of generating super long arcs to manufacturer an enemy menacing enough to seem invincible is as routine as the human necessity
                  to breathe.  Not to mention the inevitable character flaws/weakness he will endure to strengthen his resolve in conquering the unbeatable foe.  Let’s not forget the inane qualities of our protagonist, some of which include childish behavior and ridiculous low intelligence (particularly for someone who is expected to save the world).  Suffice it to say, the process is commonplace and to be expected when one engages in viewing such anime.  
Enter: One Punch Man.
Gratuitously long plots are a thing of the past when Saitama is on the case.  Villains barley have enough screen time to utter their name before being vaporized by the kinetic energy of the One Punch Man.  And rightfully so, why would a hero waste time trifling with second rate adversaries when he could be saving endangered citizens?  Practically speaking, its what any sensible hero would and should do.  Attempting to reform a criminal by allowing them to live, when they have committed horrendous atrocities never made sense to me; thus, making Saitama’s brand of swift and merciless justice appropriate.
Overcoming character flaws/weakness does not exist for Saitama, at least not in the traditional sense.  Typically, we encounter a hero who has a unique talent with an undying motivation to become the strongest he can become through training and other outlets.  This, as we are lead to believe, is the essence of Shounen anime, the ability to overcome burdensome challenges through sheer grit and determination.  Similar to when you play a video game for the first time, you must acquire the necessary dexterity to play proficiently enough to complete the game.  But what happens afterwards?  Your skill accelerates to the point of becoming too good and then the challenges that were once difficult become rudimentary.  How does one create a pleasurable experience when worthy competitors are non-existent?  This is the question Saitama continually asks himself when his powers become, apparently, infinite.  Coping with the permanent reality of defeating substandard opponents becomes underwhelming and quite depressing.  Imagine, if you will, playing basketball against a two-year-old.  Your success in defeating the two-year-old is all but assured, but what satisfaction does it give you when win a thousand times over (as Saitama has done by punching countless villains)?  This dilemma does not have a defined remedy, making Saitama’s eventual realization all the more soul-crushing when he determines that his strength may be unmatched.
This sort of inner personal struggle leaves Saitama feeling isolated from modern society, as he spends most of his days watching television.  Later attempts of joining the hero association do little to nothing for his gratification, and in fact, augment further emotional strains that must be burdened. 
Juxtaposing the “strong” characters (Saitama and Boros) with the “weak” characters (pretty much everyone else) reveals interesting perspectives on what power represents to individual people.  Extraordinarily, power appears to be less important to those that possess it, as opposed to people void of it.  Genos and Speed-o’-Sound Sonic are great examples of characters that lack significant power, feeling slighted and demoralized by their failures, always craving the goal rather than the experience of the process.  Whereas Saitama and Boros — characters flushed with power — hunger for an opportunity of being tested and could care less about gaining additional strength because it yields no additional happiness (law of diminishing returns).
Beyond the breaking of the Shounen code, if you will, through the psychological realities of power, One Punch Man also does so in a comedic fashion.  Some may argue, myself included, that this is where the show really shines, by tearing down walls that were thought to be untouchable.  The disclosure of Saitama’s training regimen is perhaps the prime example of spitting in the proverbial face of Shounen tropes, yet not really feeling offensive when doing so.  Comedy done in a self-deprecating way eases the tension of One Punch Man’s numerous attempts of mocking an entire genre.  For younger viewers that may not appreciate the psychological aspects of the show, the comedy alone serves as a foundational piece that can be enjoyed all on its own.
I would be remiss not to mention the wonderfully animated battle scenes that eclipse the vast majority of Shounen anime, matching the visual mastery of Samurai Champloo.  The battle scene between Saitama and Genos, in particular, has become a cult classic among fans, yielding over 6 million views on YouTube alone.  If you are on the fence about watching this anime, watch this one four minute scene and you will be instantly addicted.
Speaking of addicting (wipes nose indiscriminately, lol jk), the musical score is an adrenal rush of epic proportions.  How many times, honestly speaking, have people listened to this soundtrack when performing their daily/weekly exercise routine?  Because I use it all the time!  Just like anything in life, everyone has their own personal tastes in regards to music; however, if you enjoy fast paced guitar solos with energizing beats, then this may be up your alley.
All in all, there are multiple levels of enjoyment to be had by watching One Punch Man.  It is a lean 12 episodes that has sufficient depth to produce numerous fond memories that may take a typical Shounen 100 episodes to yield the same effect.  Not bad for a Seinen anime that aims to parody the traditional Shounen tropes present in today’s medium.

                Last year I was introduced to One Punch Man and when I read the story I Synopsis I thought to myself how could this anime be any good since the hero takes out the bad guys with just one punch. But nonetheless I started watching it and at the end of the series I was glad I watched it and I thought that this was one of the best Action anime series I have watched in a really long time.
Story
The story line of One Punch Man might seem silly at first but as you watch episode after episode the viewer will come to love it.
                  The story line is very simple and really easy to follow from start to end. There is even a little bit of a back story about the main character but just enough to keep a little bit of mystery about him in my opinion less is more and so I would give the story line a 10/10
Art
The Art work for One Punch Man is done really well right through the series, and for me there isn't anything to complain about at all. So I score it a solid 10/10.
Sound
The opening theme song of One Punch Man is one aspect that I really liked as it sets the tone for every episode of the series. Even the battle music while the fight scenes are happening is just perfectly done. When the characters talk the viewer can hear every single word they are saying so I score it a 10/10
Character
Character development is also done really well as there are some really interesting characters in the series and some characters LIKE the MC is shrouded in mystery but that is a good thing as it lets the viewer makes it own conclusions about certain characters. So I will give it a 10/10.
Enjoyment
Watching every episode was very enjoyable since in every episode there is something happening and the viewer doesn't get bored at all. So I will score it a solid 10/10.
Overall
Coming to the end of my review I would say that this series was a blast and in my opinion the MC is by far the strongest I have seen although I know there are a lot of fans that may disagree with me. The fight scenes are a masterpiece and there are 2 fight scenes in One Punch Man that I consider the best I have ever scene. For all the Dragon Ball Z fans out there please don't hate me when I say this but Saitama might be stronger than Goku & Vegeta. The final fight against the MV was so epic and I consider it the No 1 fight in anime as it was that good the best I have seen up until now. So I score One Punch Man a 10/10.",10,Wouts33

                There are a lot of reasons to like One Punch Man, ranging from the incredibly well animated fight scenes to the tongue-in-cheek serious-satire comedy. I've never felt compelled to write a review of any show, but I've been driven to give my opinion on what may be one of my favorite anime to date. I'm not going to cover any specifics of this show (No spoilers), but rather I'm hoping you know what you sign up for by the end of this review.
-- 
To start off, one of the reasons One Punch Man (OPM) is so great is that it is exactly what it's trying
                  to be. What I mean by that is that the show doesn't try to become some serious action anime, nor does it go for the over-the-top comedy routine. OPM knows that it isn't either of these things, and plays it very well. There are some very serious plotlines shown but at the same time they exist as a foil to the main character and this show exists where the two meet.
OPM is a parody at heart, a satire of those hero stories where there's some deep backstory behind all the motivations of heroes and villains. In addition to this, it also makes fun of the (classic?) overpowered main character that seems to be becoming more prevalent in current shows. The main character doesn't have some secret power that's hidden; he is the strongest man ever and the show lets you know that from the start.
Pacing is done well, and while I'm sure there are a few small things that get passed over there's no avoiding that. (I read some of the manga a while back and so I don't fully remember everything but now I get to re-read it after this show is over). Some people say that it's a bit slow but I don't think that's too big of an issue myself.
-- 
Onto the animation: Incredible. Madhouse has done a fantastic job with OPM. The style of this show is very important and there has no doubt been a lot of effort put into keeping it as true to the story as possible. In addition, the fight scenes are amazingly well animated and are a blast to watch.
Many people thought Madhouse must have been pouring a ton of money into this show (With the guest animators and all), but the truth is that the people making OPM really just want to be a part of it. This show went from an idea (no fancy art for sure, go check out the original ONE manga), to a much better drawn manga (Murata's version), and now to a fully animated show. This wasn't some producer wanting to print money by pushing out a generic formula, but instead a guy with a vision who did his best and had people see it for what it was. The OPM anime is what happens when people come together to make something awesome, and it really shows.
-- 
As for the soundtrack: another big hit. I haven't personally heard of JAM project before this, but the opening is catchy enough where I watch it every time, kind-of to build up some hype for the rest of the episode. The music during the show is really well done. It does a great job of backing up the story and action, and I don't think it could be much better if at all. The ending is more lighthearted and peaceful, and while not as exciting as the opening it still fits.
-- 
Earlier I touched on the characters and now I'll wrap those up quickly. OPM's world is a serious battle-ridden one filled with monsters and heroes who all have their own deep-rooted reasons for being who they are (for the most part). The characters all take themselves seriously with the exception of the main protagonist Saitama, who acts as a foil to the rest of the world in a sense. This leads to a lot of comedy whenever Saitama comes into contact with pretty much any other character.
-- 
Next I''ll address what I think is the most common criticism I've seen so far, which is that it gets old because you can guess what's going to happen, but guess what? That's the point. It's literally in the title, ""ONE PUNCH man"". The comedy stems from this one main character, and it is done well. If you're getting angry because you can guess what's going to happen then you're taking the show more seriously than it takes itself, and you're gonna have a bad time.
-- 
Overall I think this show is awesome, and you're in for a wild and fun ride. I can't wait for each episode to come out and maybe if we're lucky we'll get another season sometime in the future.
Thanks for reading. This was my first review so I'm open to any criticism (on style) and discussion (on content). I'd like to point out these are, for the most part, my opinions and so I'd love to discuss them. Feedback appreciated.",10,Ckris

                One Punch Man... What can be said about this show that hasn't been said already? Easily the most popular anime of the last year... Let's start with the good points. 
It wasn't hard for me to see why it caught the attention of so many anime fans. The concept of One Punch Man is one of those ideas that's brilliant just because it's so simple. It certainly had me laughing quite a bit of the time. On top of that, I found the animation and music to be very good also. 
But I wasn't totally entranced by all of it... I was about halfway through
                  the series when I realized that it was starting to feel a bit... slow. I wasn't excited to move on to the next episode like I had been early on. I suppose the feeling of brilliance I'd gotten from the mere concept had started wearing off, and I was left feeling like there wasn't much of a story past the original idea... Even the characters, both heroes and villains alike, had started to feel almost painfully one-note. I really liked the idea that Saitama was left feeling unsatisfied because in his quest to be a hero, he'd overleveled himself, in a sense. But the writing didn't really stick with that enough for me to consider it the cornerstone of the story. Which unfortunately left me feeling like there wasn't much of a story at all. Just one bland villain after another. 
But I am excited to see what they're planning to do with a second season, now that it's been announced. We were left on a cliffhanger of sorts, and if they follow through on that note, Genos, at least, should be getting some much-needed character development.",7,Duckielover151

                OPM is pretty much the funniest anime I've ever watched. The story is pretty simple but hella fun. Also i would say that Saitama is really original character.
The artwork is so damn good and the voice actors were picked perfectly.
This series combines comedy and fighting very well. But gotta say that the story sometimes feels odd and too simple. That's also why this feels so short. The story could have been much longer. Some of the combat scenes are to much repetetive and I wish if there would be more of them and they would be a bit more serious for Saitama. ",9,vashykWeeb

                One Punch Man, As you can guess, a hero seemingly defeating all the enemies with just one punch, might sound like a boring story that it doesn't involve the excitement and whole lot of tactics to fight like other shonen animes. I thought so at the beginning but as the story progresses you start to enjoy everything it provides you.
As the manga is still on a progress we have yet to know the upcoming characters and even powerful enemies and see the so self-proclaimed hero defeating them, But the characters seem pretty decent and as badass as can see in some other shounen animes. The
                  writer has done a good job on character development so far.
The fact that despite the overwhelming power and its demonstration, the main character is struggling to get to the limelight which is humorous and I find it enjoyable. Each episode gives us equal satisfaction, all the boredom will be over after couple of episodes then you will desire for more and never ending story.",9,sajit

                Rewatching ""One Punch Man"" I see it was mostly a joke due to Saitama's godly strength. I never really cared about Saitama's strength until now due to him also being pretty much invincible. I do wonder how he says he doesn't know how to have emotions when he has dreams about having emotions and if he had emotions in his dreams wouldn't he remember the dream? I will just not talk about that now.
The only person who was able to not die from Saitama in the first 10 seconds was Boros but he was defeated by Saitama's serious punch. Which makes me think ""If Boros
                  withstood Saitama's regular punches he must of had a great defense."" But still I give ""One Punch Man"" a 10/10.

                On a supercontinent Earth, powerful monsters and villains have been wreaking havoc in the cities. In response, the millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. He has trained himself to the point of being able to defeat any enemy with a single punch, but his unmatched strength has left him with an overwhelming sense of boredom. Saitama eventually becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown. Saitama and Genos join the Hero
                  Association, but due to scoring low on the written entry exam, Saitama is placed at a low-entry rank, and his feats remain unnoticed and unappreciated by the public.
The Hero Association calls all the top heroes to a meeting, informing them that the seer Shibabawa had a vision that the world is in danger before dying. Immediately after, an alien named Boros invades the planet. The heroes fight the invaders outside Boros's ship, while Saitama boards the ship and fights Boros, who notoriously survives more than one punch from Saitama before being defeated. Saitama meets other heroes, such as the martial artist Bang, the esper Blizzard, and King, a hero considered the strongest man on Earth. Monsters also begin to appear at a rising rate. Another growing threat is the rogue martial artist Garo, Bang's former apprentice and self-dubbed ""Hero Hunter"" Garo, who fights and defeats heroes to grow stronger and become a ""monster"".
The monster influx is revealed to be the doing of the Monster Association, an organization composed of monsters intent on destroying the Hero Association. They attack various cities, kidnap a Hero Association executive's child, and recruit fighters by offering them ""monster cells"", which cause humans to mutate into monsters with extraordinary abilities. Throughout all this, Garo bonds with a child who idolizes heroes, seeks out heroes to battle, and greatly improves his fighting abilities. The Monster Association attempts to recruit him, and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses. Garo enters the Monster Association headquarters in City Z to rescue the child, but is captured. The Hero Association also breaches the headquarters to rescue the executives' child and a chaotic battle ensues, in which City Z is destroyed. The majority of the Monster Association's leaders are slain, but many of the heroes, overconfident in their abilities, are defeated. Garo, having achieved tremendous power, defeats the remaining heroes, before Saitama in turn arrives and defeats him. Despite the objections of the other heroes, Saitama spares Garo's life and lets him flee.
In the aftermath of the battle, the Hero Association's poor performance leads to public opinion of them plummeting. Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes, a burgeoning rival group that appears to be more effective in handling the growing monster threats with its larger membership and the leadership of the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of the long-missing Blast.",8,Fardin_923

                If I had watched the anime first before reading both the original webcomic and the remake by Murata, I would have definitely rated this higher. Alas, what's done is done and what I can say is the manga is better and outshone the anime in multiple places. That's just a consequence of the source material originating from manga form after all. I can't really blame the anime because the medium itself just isn't the right one for some of the set pieces and jokes. For example, when Genos first introduces himself to Saitama, he gives an incredibly wordy and hilariously generic tragic character story which
                  is purposely shown as a huge wall of text in a speech bubble in the manga. In the anime Genos goes on  for a full minute or two to do this gag, which feels really drawn out and paced poorly compared to the manga. Again, this is just the problem with switching mediums.
Story (7/10):
The anime follows the manga almost to a tee so the story remains largely the same. The only really notable change is that the anime is missing all of the special one-shot chapters, which is a shame because some of those are the best ones in the manga and hold significant world-building and some character development. Other than that, the anime adds more focus on the Heroes Association and scenes involving heroes that weren't in the manga. Now the story itself isn't really anything to write home about. Its serviceable and builds enough intrigue and mystery to keep you going. One thing I love about OPM is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's a comedy first, action second kinda show and the plot reflects that. I do have a small gripe with it, which is that it is kinda like a monster-of-the-week deal with not much lore. The manga does hint at a overarching villain, but the anime is far far from even being close to that point. Again, these issues don't really hurt the story in anyway because as I said, it is a comedy. It's just that having a bit more lore would spice up the story and make this great anime even better.
Art (7/10):
The art is great, but alas I have been spoiled by Murata. Though its definitely way better than the webcomics (which is almost purposefully ""bad""), the art in this anime falls short of the manga. Some of it is because of again, the medium change. Especially with the introduction of Metal Knight. In the manga, Metal Knight showing up to destroy the meteor is an entire chapter of just him flying and landing in watercolor, which is one of the very few times a chapter is in color. The last page of this chapter is particularly orgasm inducing as the city is reflected off his shiny helmet.This scene was a brilliant visual switch up and the anime couldn't really come close to the same effect since its already in color. Also sometimes the animation during fight scenes would switch to a less detailed but more kinetic art, which kinda put me off the first time watching it. It's not terrible, but I wish they kept the same animation throughout. 
Sound (9/10):
They absolutely nailed the opening song and the theme song. Incredibly memorable and exactly what I would imagine the main songs for OPM would be. This is a lot more than I can say for a majority of animes. The only thing stopping me from giving it a 10 is that they do reuse some tracks a fair bit, which is kinda annoying at times.
Character (8/10):
The characters in OPM, like the story, isn't anything to write home about. They are solid, believable and most importantly feel human. The case can be made for Saitama being inhuman since he exhibits a Dr. Manhattan kinda of feel because he is literally infinitely strong. He is definitely not easy to relate to since all his obstacles die in one punch and no effort. There is a reason why shounen animes and mangas are so popular and its because the vast majority of people can identify with the immense struggles and insecurities that main characters eventually overcome in order to reach their goals. In OPM, struggles are instead delegated to the secondary characters in the Heroes Association. This is a very bold move and it pays off in dividends because the plethora of strong characters with solid motivations and unique designs carry the anime in the character department. One interesting difference I noticed about the anime from the manga is that the anime tries to make some of the lesser heroes more ""heroic"" by including scenes that show them in a positive light that weren't in the manga. In the manga, the majority of  heroes are shown to be more ambiguously grey in their morals. Most join the HA for fame and glory and aren't above using dirty tricks to get ahead of other heroes. Now they're a few good apples in this mix and most of them would, when push comes to shove, do their duty. 
Overall, the anime was probably the best adaptation we could have had for one of my favorite mangas of all time. I do want to stress that if you're not sure whether to read or watch it first, I would highly recommend watching it first because I'm sure your enjoyment of the anime would be diminished otherwise. Anyway, this is a solid anime and you should hop on it.",8,bluetree70

                This is a special anime. It was the first anime that truly got me back into watching anime and held me. its story is good, great art and sound, it characters at amazing, and overall is a great anime for veterans and newbies alike. Without this id still be watching YouTube thinking on how to waste my time. Then, from the heavens above, browsing Netflix saw ""One Punch Man."" Thought to my self, why not, finished it then looked for more anime, and became a weaboo. This has given it a special place in my heart but. I do believe it is a good anime

                This anime mostly annoyed me.  Seeing the citizens and other heroes slander Saitama and say he's a cheater over a incident that legit no one witnessed other than Genos and the old hero that's from Class S.  Imo Saitama is even more stronger than any of the Class S heroes.  The only positive result from this is that Saitama handles the hate so well.  Every episode I hope to experience the relief after the citizens finally realize how awesome Saitama is, but once that peak in the episode arrives, ofc everything has to be messed up and somehow some dumb citizen
                  twists the narrative and makes Saitama out to be the bad guy.  The only person that I think truly appreciates Saitama is Genos, which is understandable since Saitama is his master after all.  But I wish that the story really allowed the viewer to experience the relief of Saitama being acknowledged instead of constantly teasing us.  Other than that, the art style is amazing, going from a basic style to a whole detailed style in just a second.",7,hestiaaaa

                The main character was genius and nothing like any other anime I have seen. I love how powerful he is, yet humble. It makes me respect him much more.
The animation quality was well done.
The story was a little lack luster but I couldn't have expected anything else from an anime like this. The comedic aspects were great, and the villains were well done. 
Sound production is pretty good.
I would say in some points of this anime I have been a tad bit bored from such an intense buildup. I believe the creator was trying to make the defeat a little funnier, but I was itching
                  to see Saitama just one punch the Sea King or whatever his name is.",7,BL00DCR0W

                Okay, first off: One Punch Man is definitely a must watch anime. If you like action anime that have a good balance between comedy and seriousness, this anime is wonderful and you should for sure give it a watch. 
Though lets cut right to the chase. If you are are looking for an anime with a solid story line, lovable characters, solid artwork or just a series that would be 10/10 on your own personal scale; THIS ONE IS NOT FOR YOU. Though I do agree that the hype was there, and it was amazing for a hype anime to begin with, it did lack
                  a few qualities that, in my book, made it just a ""good"" anime.
First, lets look at story. If you have already watched this series, you may say otherwise, but this story is clearly incomplete and even for a first season, could have had a bit more substance. For those who have not watched this series, I will not spoil it for any of you, but just prepare to be unimpressed when it comes to an actual story. There is clearly a lot left out (considering OPM2 might be a thing somewhere down the road), which is okay if this anime didn't leave huge chunks of possible story out of the entirety of the first season. It is downright aggravating to leave so many good characters with such empty roles.
While I am on the topic of the actual characters, ignoring the thought that the characters have empty roles throughout the anime, each one also give a somewhat lackluster as they are introduced. As the anime is based around Saitama (who happens to be the most lackluster out of everyone), it appalls me to justify the reason why they did not at least provide some kind of insight to the others as well. The only back-story worth mentioning comes from Saitama himself, and even then there is much more to be desired from it. However, I will give this anime credit where it is due: This one actually NEEDED the characters this way to keep up its hype. You as a viewer will quickly understand what I mean as you watch this series.
Lastly, I will talk about the artwork, and by god does it do this right. Imagine the dorky-ness from the artists of Trigun or Gurren Lagann, mixed with the seriousness of animes such as Bleach or Naruto, while adding in the intense and sketchy line-work (for certain fight scenes particularly) from Dragon Ball or Akame Ga Kill..... Okay, maybe I'm being a little over-dramatic here, but you get the point. The artwork, if nothing else, for me, was amazing. It matched the setting where it needed to,  and it exploded where it mattered most. I do have to give it a 9/10 for this category sadly. Even though the art hit home, it was still rather ""so-so"". I have seen anime that pull off this effect better honestly (Gintama, Katanagatari, Fate Zero, and FMA to name a few). 
Though great for the hype, it was merely that: a hype. If it takes off further past this point, I see this series having great potential to grow and expand past what it has already given (which in all honesty is quite a damn lot). For now, I'll just give it time to become more...and hopefully when it does, Saitama will find an opponent that will actually put up with more than just one punch.",7,Haru-Riggins

                there's something rather fascinating about the position one punch man's landed itself recently within the anime canon and its viewers--a heel turn, of sorts. make no mistake, this season of 2015's most popular anime is still revered among mainstream anime fans, but they themselves are part of the problem if you ask any 'serious' anime viewer that watches more than whatever shonen's airing on toonami. that is to say, mainstream anime fans usually gobble up garbage after garbage whether it be sword art online and its numerous aimless sequels and its demon spawn of isekai cousins, pornsick angled romance or slice of life, or naruto
                  for the seventh or eighth time. and so, it's easy to conflate anime 'popularity' with... 'bad'. 
but one punch man isn't bad. in fact, it's good: damned good. it's one of the few times the general audience really got it right, and it's pretty easy to figure out why, too: the premise, attention grabbing as it is, is delivered through absolutely brilliant animation, key frames drawn and directed by legitimately the masters of the industry all phoned in for favors. legitimately every episode is filled with charming visuals, liquid movement--there's so many EXTRA bits of effort put in here and there that the concept of ""filler"" is completely absent throughout its twelve episode run, and that's really, really fucking impressive. to really sell you on this, i invite you to pick legitimately any episode and just watch it on mute. analyze--really observe just how buttery smooth and expressive every little action is. 
that being said, it's almost a crime to even suggest muting one punch man when so much attention has been given to ensuring voice acting is top notch and its accompanying background tracks pull their weight. saitama sounds perfect. genos sounds perfect. tatsumaki sounds perfect. there's not a single misdirected role given, and the range everyone displays is phenomenal, especially previously mentioned one punch man himself, he who can go from thoughtless dumbass to distracted dumbass to serious... dumbass. i joke, but he really feels like a rounded character through his emotions (and i don't just say that because of his head shape). there's so much emphasis put on having saitama respond to situations uniquely in his saitama way, and the range... god, i'm struggling to really verbally express what i mean here. music wise, everything's up to snuff. it's a battle shonen at its heart, parody or not, and hearing THAT music or THAT track at key moments really sell the direction of each scene, the motion of the plot, the suspense of waiting on a hero. major props to saitama's direct character theme, ""seigi shikkou"".
i lose myself. let's wrap this up for why i specifically enjoy, love, etc what i describe: the writing. the premise, as funny as it is, immediately suggests a wearisome element--just how interesting can this be if no enemy is a match for the protagonist? the show is prepared to respond to this dilemma right from episode 1--it doesn't matter if saitama wins a punching bout or how he does so (he punches), because the battles one punch man really faces are psychological--against the self, against the minds of others, against unwinnable forces present through words only. the first episode, that which could legitimately sell itself as a short film if wanted, deals with the concept of boredom, of becoming so powerful that the fun is sapped from it all--this theme continues on through the show in a beautiful climax towards the end. other themes govern other subjects: ""what's the point of winning if no one cares i won?"" ""what can you even do when public opinion has already turned against you?"" ""why will people hate you even after you've saved them?"" and my absolute, absolute, holy shit this is incredible i wish i could write more but i'm avoiding spoilers: ""when you see yourself in others, how long can you humor them?""
i wish i could delve more deeply into these aspects, but you must absolutely take my word for it when i say one punch man deals with every single one of these lines of questioning, and does so respectfully. it does so through one of the single best written characters of anime, period--someone who is grounded and down to earth, but no genius. someone who has very little time for extravagant displays and showmanship. someone who's reasons for being a hero are, frankly, dumb. someone who isn't afraid to inject humor into adversity (but not in, like, a standard awful tropy japanese way).

                One Punch Man doesn't do anything very different, but what it does do is take a very uninteresting concept, and makes it very enjoyable and even funny to watch. This show can come off as formulaic is some episodes. Example: A big threat comes to take over the world, then Saitama comes and kills them in obviously one punch. It's not like that in every episode though. 
This show has really great comedy bits in it that succeed in executing them. I love how Saitama is drawn like  cartoon character when he isn't serious , but then he is drawn with more realistic details
                  when he does get serious. This show has great characters in it too. My favorite being Genos, a teenage cybrog. 
The animation was definitely one of my favorite aspects of the show. The animation is fantastic, some of the best I have seen yet. 
I recommend this show to anybody who is a little bored with the same old shonen shows and wants to see a comedic take on it.",8,Tyler_M41

                This anime is really hyped up but for a change it actually deserves it. Story is deceptively simple when it on initial thought seems like a power trip fantasy and fan service. Underneath all that power display lies our main character troubled with problems which every day's existence imposes on most of us. On one hand you have the most powerful being universe has and yet he has to think about getting food on sale. Punch powerful to level mountains and yet still being judged by everyone based on his appearance.
Art is nothing short of best there is currently. Some of the most notable names
                  in anime industry working on most dynamic and well animated fight choreography I've seen to date in anime. Sound and music perfectly fit animation, which with such a high bar set, is really hard thing to do.

Overall 5/10
1. There's no story. A monster attacks, the bets of the best heroes can barely leave a scratch on t and Saitama comes to save the day by not even putting any effort. In almost every episode the scale of destruction is s great that easily hundreds of not thousands die. It makes me wonder how the heck the humanity is still alive. Saitama doesn't care
                  and neither do I after 3rd episode I believe.
2.Visually it's great. The animation is impeccable too especially during fights.
3. It's good but somehow I feel like they didn't make as good of use of it as they could.
4. Utter disaster.  Almost every character in the show, be it hero or villian, exists solely to show you how strong, and superior to them, Saitama is. It quickly gets annoying. There are a couple of heroes who are in the S tier- they're supposed to be the strongest and the best of the best and yet they hardly do anything even when they put their 100% in the fight and do basically nothing.
Then Saitama pops up and saves the day effortlessly with blank expression. Saitama has the worst fights in the show. It is the other characters that have more interesting moments and that's due to the fact that they're actually trying and can get their butts kicked too. Saitama on the other hand bends all laws of physics and relity in general. Nothing can harm him because of the intense AMATEUR training he did. Doesn't matter if it's a mutant, a robot, explosion or a black hole- Saitama will withstand it all effortlessly.
5.I expected a nice comedy I got... a very cringy shonen. The show is dumb and only for those who enjoy over the top fights with plethora of explosions and destruction because this show isn't anything beyond that.",5,Krukk

But today morning, i saw this anime on my brother's computer. I had nothing to do and i thought there is no harm in watching it so i tried watching it and i kept trying and so i thought but i completed the series without knowing. The series was incredible.

                Interesting concept that's executed poorly aka a failed parody that is, at best, a poor reproduction/recycling of bits of older franchises that has no comment/improvement upon such material/tropes beyond maybe... ""ha ha isn't that reference funny?""
For an average modern anime with a style that's at times reminiscent of ""Dragon Ball Z"", the art on a skill level is fine. The effect of Saitama's average boring bald dude look versus the relatively hyperstylized characters is used for comedic effect, usually in a good way (it's best during the latter end of his battle with Boros). The fights are by and large boring, which isn't a great
                  sign for a series named after a character who hits things, even if only once. There's a decent amount of fighting in the series, but the 'best' scenes to watch are when Genos throws fire, so essentially when the screen is just a wash of varying shades of orange, yellow, and brown. The other fights are just generic Anime Slash fights. A lot of stories do this. It does not help this one stand out.
I know this is a webcomic that was redone into a more polished manga which was then made into this anime, and it's only season 1, and it has OVAs. That being said, the character designs still suck by and large. Boros is perhaps the epitome of ugly designs and looks more like a fanmade DBZ character from the mid-90s you'd find in the bowels of deviantart than anything else. Deep Sea King looks like he stepped out of a ""One Piece"" episode (and not necessarily because he's water-related), with the random bikini shorts, heart pasties, Party City crown and cape, and basically everything else about his character model and power set.
Sonic is Uchiha Sasuke in tight clothes who makes escher poses a lot with a name that's a random reference to a video game (which is potentially why he's purple instead of, perhaps, blue? Didn't stop them from having him do a spin dash at one point), a ridiculous obsession with anything ninja-related which is never funny and absolutely nothing creative on the generic modern shonen ninja. He's fast. He uses kunai and swords a lot. He's 'sneaky'. It says a lot that the only funny thing about this character is when he reacts to another character stripping, which is more about dialogue writing than character design or development. And that it looks like one of the gags in ""Fullmetal Alchemist"". I'm pretty sure FMA didn't invent the gag, but it's certainly helped popularize it in the last decade or so. Also the joke about Sonic's name is never funny and the gag is used overmuch (it's not insulting; I just didn't find it funny and thought it took time from literally anything else). Ignoring all the attempts to make Sonic interesting or comical, like that time he landed crotch-first on Saitama's fist (aw dick jokes, so funny, much creative), I'm confused about what besides the stereotypical modern anime/manga ninja trappings actually make this guy a ninja? We're told he's been linked to various assassinations and illegal goings-on, but outside of being fast and causing some physical mayhem, we're never shown him actually doing anything ninja-related, even from a stereotypical modern anime/manga ninja standpoint. He is once shown appearing out of nowhere, then appearing out of the shadow of a statue. He never sets traps, kidnaps or kills anyone (that we see), certainly by assassination, attempted or otherwise, he never gathers intel besides just standing in place while people who can obviously see he's there purposefully ignore him. His whole shtick is basically 'look at me I'm a whacky ninja otaku with a creepy grin!' It's like someone watched ""Sengoku Basara"" and took the worst elements of the two main ninja characters and smashed them into one character, with some extra generic meme nonsense and voila. Sonic. A better parody would be to create an actually good-at-their-job ninja character. Sonic isn't parody. It's the lowest level of reproduction, and it's not even funny or interesting.
I'm unsure how to deal with Amai Maske. I feel like his character is meant to either be another bishounen villain or just a 'gotcha' about how the bishounen isn't the Hero, or maybe how shady people working optics are? But his villainous plans - for which we get a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing - are never revealed. Nor is his personality. Nor is he ever shown as either a villain or a hero. He's just kind of there to be vaguely menacing and useless and take up time? He shows up several times in the series and yet all we know about him is that he's the top of Class A, refuses to be promoted to Class S, acts, sings, and does PR stuff with a connection to the Hero Association. That's it. His Wikipedia entry, for all that it's about the same length as this paragraph, is more informative than all of his appearances put together in the season. And that's not just because I'm bad at summarizing.
The plot is pretty repetitive and boring. Every episode/mini 'arc' revolves around 'villain shows up, non-Saitama characters attempt to and fail to deal with villain, long drawn out wait until Saitama punches out the villain'. I stopped caring about where Saitama got his powers a long time ago. I just assumed that his attacking his first villain unlocked some latent powerset that he then trained, physically and mentally, to its current status. I don't even care if it's true because the plot point doesn't matter. Saitama has his beliefs. The other characters, by the end of the series, are only just starting to believe he's who he appears to be (aka the most powerful character in the show, besides maybe Tornado). Like haha, it's funny because his origin story is that he obtained superpowers by working out. Did you get it?
Genos basically has other goals, like becoming a better hero. The only real potential villain is the shadowy group running the Hero Association. They act so menacing because… that's what shadowy groups in charge of associations of powerful thugs with no apparent policing mechanism do? What are their goals? Are THEY the real villains? How is the government not cracking down on how much damage their people cause? Who knows and who cares apparently, because the creative team behind this show don't seem to, and even if they do, there's no build-up to make the audience care. I'm only asking these questions because I'm trying to find some thread to grab onto in this garbled web of maybe-conspiracies and generic tropes. A parody would take this and say ""yo, these people are shady as fuck, lack accountability based on their powers, and look at the cost their actions have"" but no. No that's not what happens, besides a couple landscape shots of destruction and Shady Randos Being Shady.
A lot of the plot is no more notable than your average ""I want to become/fight the strongest there is"" shounen series, particularly the competition ones. Except even the most generic of THOSE usually had more character development in a single fight than this has in an entire 12-episode season. There's one moment of character development in the series. It's a good moment and it's the only thing I like about Saitama. It's at the end of the fight with Deep Sea King, when the people react to it and he responds. Outside of that… there is nothing remarkable about this other than, again, a neat idea executed poorly. You could argue that this trope is the only point of parody in the series, because it is a stupid goal buried in toxic masculinity, and we are frequently reminded that it is a stupid, pointless goal in almost every episode, while watching various versions of toxic masculinity strutting around. But it's not enjoyable to watch? An actual parody would have actual stakes and have the protagonist facing consequences on his journey to fight the best there is. Saitama doesn't face any consequences for his actions other than like... anonymity, which he doesn't even care about for part of the series.
Because of part of the main premise - that Saitama's only real goal is to fight strong opponents who take more than one punch to defeat - and the fact that there is no ongoing villain, there's little to no tension and little to no stakes that make you care about anything that's happening. Saitama will on rare occasions demonstrate that he cares for other people (namely Genos and a couple heroes; I think one or two civilians). Otherwise, he has no interest in heroics, other than fighting strong opponents. He has no interest in learning about his opponents or improving his techniques. He has extremely little interest in learning about his peers, at least when Genos hasn't already explained something. And he has no apparent interest in investigating where his abilities came from, even if it really is just strength training and force of will. Since few villains get any development outside of beating up the thugs to get to the boss fight, none of the villains matter either. So there's nothing to care about. If a fight were to end on a brand new episode 13 with Saitama dying, I have the impression that the response from the audience would be one of Saitama's nonplussed ""huhs,"" followed by a channel flip. The problem with de-emphasizing your usual superhero trope plot is that the rest should be compelling, like a slice-of-life hero story. But Saitama's everyday isn't interesting or at least funny, either. There's the time he tries to kill a bug and that's honestly it. There are far more interesting and enjoyable (and funny) stories that focus on the slice-of-life side of heroes, as well as the consequences of a heroic lifestyle, or living in a city with superpowered nutjobs running around. This is not one of them, even if it clearly wants to be.
You'd think throwing in other characters who have motivation beyond being the strongest would change things and bring some stakes. There are people and property at stake. Will Genos complete his quest? Will Rider survive? Will the civilians die? Oh wait, we've run out of motivations for non-Saitama characters that don't involve 'fighting strong opponents/fighting anything/being pointlessly menacing'. On top of that, the side characters make no progress in their character arcs, and their actions seldom matter, and they typically only matter because Saitama, for all that he's a brilliant fighter, is pretty much an intellectual idiot. It's because he takes so long and stays out of the loop - besides watching cable TV - that more people are injured or killed and more property is damaged. And, like Genos, he has no qualms about how much damage he causes with his attacks. Besides, why does it matter that lots of people are hurt or killed and property is destroyed? No one faces any consequences for it, outside of Saitama's area being vacated. Sure, civilians might weep and scream in fear, there's a ""memorial"" at the end of episode 12 to the fallen City A, but so what? None of the heroes, not even Amai Maske, think about how many people died. How much money and time it will take to rebuild. None of them are shown treating the injured, pulling bodies out of the rubble. Despite the fact that Mumen (and Co.) are shown going into the danger zone to collect survivors, there is no spotlight on 'normal' rescuers like firefighters, police, EMTs, and so on, doing their jobs and perhaps even losing their lives as a result. Somehow I doubt season 2 starts a la ""The Incredibles"" with an ongoing court case where a ""victim"" of a superhero ""blunder"" sues the superhero, followed by a mass government ban on supers due to their destructive capabilities.
It's also not funny enough or visually interesting enough for the exaggerated tone it tries to take on. I should find Saitama being thrown from the Earth to the moon hilarious, particularly when he squeezes his nostrils shut and keeps his mouth closed like he's underwater, then comically tosses up a moon rock with an understated ""oh, nifty"" moment like it's NBD that he's suddenly in outer space. Instead I'm thinking ""I guess he's supposed to be strong enough to simultaneously resist being frozen to death, burned by solar radiation to death, and imploding."" Followed by ""why didn't that kick off from the moon, which apparently heavily damaged OUR MOON so much, cause catastrophe back on Earth?"" A voice in my head says ""it's a generic shounen and it's supposed to be used for humor or to show how badass he is"" but I'm not laughing. If I'm not supposed to take it seriously, then it should be funny or smart enough to compensate. It's neither of those things.
Another major issue is a question I think the series creator is fully aware of but doesn't deal with well: why do all these heroes not care about ACTUALLY being heroic aka what is a hero? A lot of them care about the fame and fortune, fighting tough opponents, showing off… but only a few actually care about BEING heroes. That's why Mumen Rider and Genos are two of the only actual heroes in the story, with Rider coming out on top even there. For all that he's pretty useless physically, Rider cares about helping people, no matter their problems or how big the obstacle. Genos willingly sacrifices himself to save others. Unfortunately, Genos also has little to no control over the damage he causes, willingly destroying a ridiculous amount of property and land on a regular basis, with no apparent qualms about it. If he ever faced consequences for it, this might be a good character development moment. Maybe he will in the future. I hope so.
But every time this question is 'addressed' in some way, it's never addressed well. Saitama has some thoughts in the Hammerhead episode about how he's wasting his time not doing anything. His solution is to join the Hero Association because he wants people to recognize him on the street. Bang doesn't want Saitama to be destroyed by the reality of being a hero, yet not once does he seem inclined to sit Saitama down and talk about his motivations and the bad parts of being a public hero. Maske wants the heroes to be more careful about the damage they cause and to be more efficient for PR reasons without explaining 'lots of people died and this will take bucketloads of cash to fix which'll be hard to come by since so many people are dead or jobless or have otherwise lost their livelihoods; they'll rip the HA apart for failing to protect them'. Sure, it's obvious if you've seen any other superhero stuff, but the narrative almost seems to back away from this idea, framing Maske as the narratively bad character attacking the heroes for doing what little good they could. And yeah, they did win. They did do what they could as soon as they could. There doesn't seem to have been any way for them to predict what happened sooner than when it happened. Both sides have legitimate gripes with the other. But Maske comes off in the narrative wrong.
Genos acknowledges how heroic Saitama is, but does nothing about it. For all that he's ready to jump to Saitama's defense when Saitama opens his one nice letter, not once does he contact his superiors to try to clear things up about Saitama's accomplishments and Genos or his comrades taking credit. Not once does he combat the trolls, write to the newspapers or the media or fanclubs. He doesn't even say ""I saw what you did with Deep Sea King, and I am deeply honored to be your disciple"" or something (aloud, to Saitama).
Furthermore, Genos has this weird awkward socially inept quirk that's never funny? I think it's making fun of angsty backstories in fiction, particularly superhero stories, but it's overused. The more endearing parts of Genos' character is how protective he is of Saitama from a mental standpoint - willing to go after those who send Saitama cruel letters and being protective of Saitama's reputation - and how he is, again, one of the only actually 'heroic' characters in the story. But while these are sweet moments, they aren't things that save the rest of the series, or the rest of the character.
Then there are the actually irritating parts of the series. There are at least two caricatures - Puri-Puri Prisoner and Carnage Kabuto. Puri-Puri might have been fine for yet another generic flamboyantly gay muscular dude (I'm not sure he's bara since I think bara is more muscular) if that was all he was. Another generic anime character in a sea of them. But he's also potentially a serial sexual assaulter and stalker. He's an S-class hero who was put in prison because he ""couldn't stop attacking attractive men"". He breaks into a hospital to give two male characters their ""angel shot"", in a moment that is clearly supposed to be a gag. Ah sexual assault on men, particularly by other men. Such a 'fun' gag in shounen. Then there's the fact that he's only put back in jail the once, then, for no apparent reason, no one cares or bothers to put him back after that second breakout. He's still wearing prison clothing in the last arc. There's no evidence that he's pardoned or new evidence was found or what. He's just there because… because? He's supposed to be funny. He's not.
I don't know how to properly analyze Kabuto and this might be something specific to the anime, since the manga is in black and white. It fits with other issues that pop up through anime and manga where the creators demonstrate that they clearly have issues with their perception of black people. At best, the character made me feel uncomfortable, and not in an ""oh, he's a villain"". It's one of those, no matter how you spin this one, it was a bad move, design-wise.
And of course there's how this series treats women. It's not one of the worst shounen out there. In fact, there's a marked absence of overt sexism for most of the series that sets it apart from most shounen. Part of the problem is that outside of a few bystanders, Tornado, some nameless characters in suits, and Mosquito Girl, there are no other female characters in the show. The show is by and large a story about a world largely run by men and fighting with men to protect other men (and some women). Since women so rarely show up, and the men only really talk about fighting each other and their opinions of each other, there's little chance for the sexual objectification and harassment you'd find in your average shounen.
That doesn't mean that the series doesn't have a serious problem with women. Just looking at the Hero Association, one of the… almost hilarious problems is when we first see that random board of higher ups talking about admitting the new heroes. Most of the characters in the room are men wearing suits, but most of the few women are wearing a modified suit that looks more like a modified playboy bunny suit. It seems to indicate that the artist(s) have never realized that regular suits made for women can emphasize boobs without modifying the suit jacket to overly emphasize HERE THAR BE BOOBIES. Likely because they've never actually looked at a real woman in a real suit. Of course there are a couple women in the series wearing regular, realistic office suits, but the boob suit just… wow.
Then there's Tornado. The diminutive 28-year-old S-class hero, who is apparently the only known female S-Class character. In fact there are no known female A-Class characters, and only one named female B-Class hero, who happens to be Tornado's sister and who, so far as I can recall, doesn't show up in season 1. There's also no known female C-class members. Even in the trials to join the association, women are seldom if ever shown, although there is one woman wearing some kind of silly bikini costume in at least one shot.
Mosquito Girl's design is generic, uncreative, and heavily sexualized. As the only female villain, although it has nothing to do with how she fights and no other male villain tries this (unless you count Puri-Puri I guess), she is given a seductive personality and ridiculous boobs. Despite the fact that she's wearing some kind of paint or armor, she's even more objectified than when Puri-Puri strips all of his clothes off, or when Deep Sea King walks around in his speedo bottom and pasties. I assume because the creators had no idea how else to design a female villain other than 'sexy evil villain'. No male villain or character is sexualized or objectified, save for Sonic, who has a tendency to strike random escher poses in his skintight outfit. This might be somewhat close to evening the field, but again, Tornado and Mosquito Girl are the only two named female characters in this series, and the only two female characters of note (and it's possible that, given the colorscheme, Sonic is being queer-coded, so… sigh). Everyone else is occasional background ornamentation, or that one little girl Genos saves. Thus, you have two objectified women who form the totality of the female cast, whereas the men, for all that their designs are lacking in imagination, fit a variety of body types, clothing styles, and personalities, and there are very, very many male characters in this season. Certainly more than two, or four, or eight. Not to mention that looking at wiki, there are even MORE male characters who have yet to show up.
I want to like Tornado. She's one of the most powerful characters in the series and we have yet to see her have any weaknesses other than a short temper that makes her waste time yelling at people rather than just solving problems. Every time she's actually attacking something she's really badass. And Mosquito Girl is one of the more terrifying villains, for all that she's shorter lived than almost every other villain in the show. She's one of the few villains we see consequences for outside of property damage, and it's one of only two times body horror shows up in the series. But the way these characters are drawn, their personalities are crafted, and the world around them is designed… I just can't.
Needless to say, there is nothing of parody in its portrayal of women. At best it's just dumb recycling of shonen tropes, with precisely zero commentary on the matter.
In short, the art is passable, the plot is boring, the character designs are generic, stupid and/or insulting, and honestly the best I can say of this series is that it's short and watchable if you're bored and want to know what the big 2016 buzz was all about. I got a few laughs out of it. That's it. If you want a good superhero-centered animated story that satirizes the superhero genre, while involving character development and humor, watch ""Tiger & Bunny"" (or ""The Incredibles""). If you want a coming of age hero story, read ""Sailor Moon"" or watch ""Cardcaptor Sakura"".",2,WdaCdaShdaDid

English version:
One punch man is a funny anime and very good show. The story follows Saitama, a hero who defeats all enemies with just one punch, but not only that, he is strong, seems to have a body of steel, impenetrable, his strength even defies physics, even surpassing the telekinetic powers of some villains. What appears to be a weak plot becomes a lot of fun when the viewer begins to empathize with the various characters in the plot.
One punch man is an anime/manga that has a plot of superheroes that has already been manned, a city with several heroes that fight villains
                  that appear from nowhere; hero ranking system as if it were a real job, not as if the heroes did it just for justice or to help society. With this plot, it's possible to introduce several different characters (and it's impossible not to love at least 10 of them), and ONE took advantage of this very well, creating characters that satirize old works and very good original characters.
Speaking of satirization, as a good comedy anime, ONE satirizes a lot of old shounen works, where the protagonist spends hours and hours fighting and only getting stronger at the end of the fight. I know Saitama should be just a joke, but I really take him seriously, he has morals and ethics, unlike many shounen characters out there, even though he is the strongest in the universe, he can be humble and care about feelings. In short, he is the perfect character, who despite losing his sparkle in his eyes and faith in humanity, manages to fight for good and live peacefully in his ghost town.
Portuguese version: 
One punch man é um anime engraçado e muito bom de acompanhar. A história segue Saitama, um herói que derrota todos os inimigos com apenas um soco, mas não apenas isso, ele é forte, parece ter um corpo de aço, impenetrável, sua força chega a desafiar a física, ultrapassando até os poderes telecinéticos de alguns vilões. O que parece ser um enredo fraco se torna algo muito divertido quando o telespectador começa a criar empatia com os vários personagens da trama.
One punch man é um anime/mangá que possui um enredo de super-heróis que já ficou até manjado, uma cidade com vários heróis que combatem vilões que aparecem do nada; sistema de ranking de heróis como se fosse um verdadeiro trabalho, e não como se os heróis fizessem isso só por justiça ou para ajudar a sociedade. Com esse enredo, é possível apresentar vários personagens distintos (e é impossível não amar pelo menos uns 10 deles), e o ONE aproveitou muito bem isso, criando personagens que satirizam obras antigas e personagens originais muito bons.
Por falar em satirização, como um bom anime de comédia, o ONE satiriza bastante obras shounen antigos, onde o protagonista passa horas e horas lutando e ficando mais forte apenas no final da luta. Eu sei que o Saitama devia ser apenas uma piada, mas eu realmente o levo a sério, ele tem moral e ética, diferente de muitos personagens de shounens por aí, mesmo sendo o mais forte do universo, ele consegue ser humilde e se importar com sentimentos. Resumindo, ele é o personagem perfeito, que mesmo perdendo seu brilhos nos olhos e a fé na humanidade, consegue lutar pelo bem e viver sossegado em sua cidade fantasma.",10,mononokegrl

                I loved this anime. Now, this is a parody, so I liked how it joked about how ridiculous shounen animes are. 
Story- 7
   One-Punch Man isn't an anime that is huge on story. The stories throughout the episodes were quite good, but a little simplistic for my taste. You can describe it as episodic. But that's not quite what it is, though. The stories got a little repetitive, though. But that didn't stop me from enjoying it, though! It was unique, but simple. The pacing was alright, nothing too amazing. The comedy was hilarious. There was a couple jokes that fell flat, Puri
                  Puri Prisoner wasn't amazingly funny, but he did make me chuckle. The ending was satisfying. Overall, not a story rich anime. If you value story over all else, this may not be your pick. I love shows that have great stories, but that didn't stop me from enjoying One-Punch Man.
Art- 10
I love the art in this show. It's very detailed and aesthetically pleasing. The art in this is very memorable. The style is fitting, we have all these detailed heroes and we have our main character Saitama, who's bland. There wasn't a lot of CGI that I noticed. I thought it was CGI, but it didn't quite look like it. It was very fluid, like the punches were being thrown at you. The backrounds were simply stunning. The designs were great, like Saitama, who's just a boring guy. All of them were unique, they're a little over the top, but that's better than same face syndrome.
Sound-10
        The voice actors were fitting, in the sub at least. The music was great, even the guitar riffs for the advertisements. The music fit the scenes well, like The Hero playing in the final fight. I'll listen to the OST a lot, I already have, haha. I never really paid attention to the ending song, but I loved the opening. 
Character-10
                Now, for my favorite element in this show. The characters. I especially like our main protagonist. He's relatable, likeable, and despite being One-Punch Man, isn't a Gary Stu. He's shown being harassed, and having unfortunate events happen to him. They reacted to situations in a realistic way, except for Saitama, who I can understand. Genos and Saitama, were fleshed out a lot. The supporting characters are a bit bland, but that's alright.
Enjoyment-10
          I loved it. The music is great, The characters are simply great, the animation is gorgeous, and while the story is lacking the other elements make up for it. I'd definitely watch this again. If you love story, maybe this isn't for you. If you like great art, great sound, great characters, give this one a watch.",10,ProfessorNess

                I will say OPM was one of the best action anime i've ever seen. Despite, being one of the best action anime i've seen still this anime lack in some places. I will mention it and Saitama is the strongest fictional character alive. I think he is beyond any god level. You will know after you have finished this anime. I will try to refrain from as many spoilers as i can.
Ok, so the main story is about Saitama who is a hero for fun. He is insanely strong. Let alone anime, i think he is the strongest fictional character. Despite being this strong he
                  says he trained for 3 years and done only pushups, sit ups and squats and he is this strong. TBH Saitama isn't even sure about the secret of his power. He is a man who is depressed because he finishes everyone in One Punch :3. XD
Then, he crossed path with a Cyborg named Genos. Genos saw Saitama's true power and became his disciple to become more and more stronger though he doesn't know whom he is roaming with (the strongest man alive)
Okay so basically i will say OPM is famous for Saitama and the actions scenes. The action scene of this anime is totally insane. Basically the last ep of S1. But i think this anime is lacking some places
Where it lacks:  You will see ahead that saitama is too much strong and has defeated thousands of demons, enrolled into Hero association, still the public and all the people claim him as a credit taker or a cheater. This was too much painful to take. This was the main side where this anime lacks. There were other places. like Saitama is like emotionless. If any girl approaches i don't think he knows how to react (though the creator made him like this intentionally). Still, you can try MOB PSYCHO 100 made by the same author of one punch man. Mob psycho is far more better and has some intense fighting scenes. It has already become very popular around the world. Try it out!
                                     SPOILERS AHEAD: 
I think Saitama is the strongest fictional character. Some say Hulk, Superman, One Above all, every one can beat him. But i think it's useless. You know why? If Saitama can defeat the god of Dark matter, the dominator of universe (Borors) without giving any effort i don't think those guys stand any chance against him.  That's all i wanted you to know .

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
One punch man is considered one of the best anime, not only from its year (2015) but from the whole history, but... Does it really deserve it?
Story: 4/10
Starting with the story, the show has almost no plot and is really repetitive with its ""monster of the week"" formula. It has no objective, besides of Saitama trying to be famous that is an extremely boring objective, and the other objective that is ""Saitama trying to find someone who is as powerful as him"" will have a bad ending from both sides. If Saitama kills that person then it would have no point and
                  the show will feel like if it is just returning to the status quo, and if the enemy kills Saitama then it would contradic totally the comedic atmosphere of the show. The show also tries to have dramatic moments that have noimpact because of the characters being boring.
Art: 10/10
After the plot, we've got the best aspect of the whole show. The art. It's simply outstanding, looks extremely fluid, the coloring i great, the desings look good and the fights are extremely bombastic. The only problem i could say here is that the battles have a very simple structure that makes them less enjoyble and more ""randm effects festival"" sometimes.
Sound: 8/10
The soundtrack of the show is very good, it fits perfectly in the action and comedic moments when it's necesary, the opening also fits perfectly with the show. The onl prblem here is the ending, that feels like a attempt to be like to origina dragon ball first ending, which doesn't fit at all with what the show is about.
Characters: 3/10
And here we return to the bad things of the show. Our protagonist Saitama is just super overpowered and he doesn't care about the problems, so he can work as a joke, but after a while the joke stops being funny.
Most of the  characters have no relevance and only defeat minor enemies. they're just parodies of cliches or direct cliches like Silver Fang being the old and smart mentor, Genos being a parody to the edgy characters with a tragic past (and a personal punchbag for the villains) and Tatasumaki being the annoying loli, other characters are taken more seriously, like the License-less Rider, but the show fails in taking them seriously because we don't know almost anything about him and he doesn't do anything relevant. If the show trie to make him more like a kind of Batman it would make him a better character, because that would show how he's using his intelligence instead of just strenght to fight, but he ends up as a one-dimensonal and boring character. The villains aren't good either, they're mostly generic monsters that want to kill people for no reason and are defeated extremely fast because of Saitama being so powerful. The most powerful villain in the show, Boros was a little better than the others because they tried to give him a motivation, but it feels extremely cliche and not as a parody, the show simply taked him too seriously instead of trying to give him a well constructed personality.
Enjoyment: 6/10
The good prodution values can disguse the show of being better than how it is actually, the humour is a hit or miss, the 2 main jokes (Saitama killing his enemy in one punch and Saitama being annoyed more because of mundane things that because of the villains) stop being funny after a while, the references work when they're not jokes and things like ""an alien that looks like Piccolo from Dragon Ball Z"" don't affect the show.
Overall: 5/10
The show's humour is too basic, the drama doesn't work, the characters are extremely simple, the vllains are one-dimensional and have no motivation, the show can't have a satisfactory ending. But the good technical values in both animation and music saves it from becoming worse, an overall meh show that everybody seems too have forgotten nowadays.",5,Adri2013

                TL;DR: If you DONT LIKE anime that aren't deep and thought provoking you might want to reconsider watching this show!
One punch man is considered by many to be ""the anime of the season"" and is considered by many to be the most boring anime ever.
This anime really is a classic example of an anime that people either love OR hate. 
STORY: Mediocre
the story is mediocre imo. it is pretty simple. Bad guys come, heroes try to defeat it and fail, saitama comes and saves the day. Pretty much the plot in a nutshell. I do not think that there is anything really wrong with it.
                  It's generic, but effective for the show because it's not supposed to have a deep story.
ART/SOUND: Great/Good
the art was amazing but also really standard at times. What I mean by this is that, especially in the non-fighting scenes, it just seems like what you would see in most other anime so in that regard it isn't something groundbreaking, HOWEVER the art really shined in the fighting scenes against the big guys that need more than one hero to defeat. It really felt like the attacks were hitting me which I really liked.
The sound complimented this very well. With good timing and tense sound when it needed to in fights. other than that it it didn't really stand out too much because it was overpowered by the sound effects.
CHARACTER: Fair
The characters are really simple and 1 dimensional. That DOESNT mean they aren't fun characters though. On the contrary, I think that all characters are weird (in a good way) and funny in their own way because what makes them unique are their powers and simple personality that makes you question why they are in the hero association.
ENJOYMENT (the most important one of course): 10/10 would 10 again
Even if everything that was up until now hasn't been the most positive that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it because it was amazing. one of the most enjoyable action anime I have seen in a while.",7,RuriBellcraft
30276,"
                Over-hype has been the flavor of the week for the last several years for me in media, Sword Art Online, Attack on Titan, and Samurai Champloo being the largest offenders for anime. So, I had been putting off this off for a while and was very pleasantly surprised that this was so great. Looking past the satirical nature, it's sort of a retelling of the original Superman story, without the childhood drama. It's why they had to change how Superman worked to have some sort of more practical weakness(beside Kryptonite) over time because frankly ultimate power is boring.
Though One Punch Man doesn't have a ton
                  in the realm of story, though it's established well enough that two things are notable, and critical:
1) You know enough about him to not be confused (more than you're supposed to)
2) They have given you enough information to establish potential plots without over explaining.
The latter, is something that a great many stories across the board tend to miss. So, I was surprised that a show, that doesn't even really take itself seriously, managed to pull it off. Art and sound were used masterfully. Changing from simple to extraordinary on a whim, they did a great job combining elements to convey what you were supposed to feel.
The weakest point might be the characters, which are meant to be (and are) various anime tropes, but even for a show that is trying to poke fun at these things, they do have a few instances that feel like it's a bit much. These bits don't particularly detract from the show, however, what loses points here is more that despite all these different personalities they establish, a lot of the characters have a weird not-my-problem attitude. It's not particularly clear why they are this way and it just comes off as annoying rather than adding any value to the show.
Overall, I really liked this show. They covered the basics I look for in a good story with something much more casual than most.",9,Far_Together

                One Punch Man, I feel, is going to become one of those anime. You know, the ones like Evangelion, Code Geass, Cowboy Bebop, Baccano. The shows that if you haven’t seen (and liked) you apparently aren’t a fan of anime….somehow. I’m going to say this at the start so people don’t lose their fucking minds when they actually read the review (Even though they still will). I don’t hate One Punch Man. There. That’s it.
The Short Version:
(+)The show is so over-the-top it’s actually entertaining.
(+)The fight scenes are the best reason to watch this show.
(+)The soundtrack gets you hype.
(-)The art in some of the fight scenes
                  is actually kinda shit.
The Story (6/10): The story of One Punch Man is probably one of the easiest stories to digest that anime has ever produced. The entire show is literally about one guy, who’s a superhero for fun, trying to find an opponent that can actually take more than one of his punches, but it’s okay that stops at about episode 5. The stuff that actually happens in the show is….extreme. I mean, in the first episode three big villains get wrecked and there’s two fights that are so over-the-top that you can only really react to them by just screaming at your monitor in the deepest and manliest voice you can possibly muster, and that screaming part of the show keeps building upon itself until the final credits, and those moments before the final credits are amazing. The ending of the show was predictable if you read the manga, and that’s exactly what the end of the show tells you to do. Go read the manga. Normally I’d have a problem with this, and I still do, but seriously you should go read the manga. That and you couldn’t really ask for a better ending.
The Character (8/10): If there’s one thing in this show that I can agree with all of its fanatics on, it’s that the two main character are just awesome, speaking of mains.
Saitama: The most laidback hero to ever exist and the ideal protagonist for a show like this.
Genos: Sort-of sidekick to Saitama and complete polar opposite to him as well.
It’s because of these two characters that I think this show works so well, the complete juxtaposition between these two are a much needed fresh air on the whole ‘hero’ angel. Instead of something like, “I’m doing this because my family died before my eyes and blahblahblah.” Saitama would just respond with, “Cause its fun.” Genos on the other hand is very much the generic hero. This is the reason I like watching this show, because in any situation you can probably guess exactly what Genos is going to say, then Saitama just comes out of nowhere and throws the serious vibe right out the fucking window.
The Art & Sound (7/10) & (7/10): I will admit that the art is pretty fucking smooth by any standard, but it isn’t the greatest I’ve ever seen. Sure in the normal dialogue scenes the animation looks great, but then when some of the fights go down, it turns to shit. It’s like your flying in a F15 Raptor or something, then suddenly that jet turns into a pair of wings that don’t work properly. I understand that sometimes it’s a lot easier to animate a fight scene by dropping the quality of the visuals, which I’m fine with so long as the scene retains that thing that makes me yell, “FUCK YES!!!!” Then again I still can’t ignore how off-putting it is shifting between the two. One thing I find infinitely impressive is that the lead animator himself said that the budget for this show wasn’t anything above average and I quote, “We aren’t working with a colossal budget, we’re working with an average budget. Everyone’s just putting their hearts and souls into every frame to make it look as great as we possibly can.” Makes me think how little effort goes into every other show really, but a round of applause is deserved by the animation team so here you go. *Claps*
The sound of this show is pretty fucking blood pumping, from the moment the OP clicks on I’m ready for shit to hit the fan, and the main battle theme with its shredding guitar just…man it’s gets me going. There are other parts of the soundtrack that caught my attention but that was really only the parts with a guitar every other part was meh, the voice acting across the board is pretty standard as far as I’m concerned.
What do you think of this anime?
This is the sort of anime I’d watch when piss drunk with my roommates, and I’m probably going to buy it when I can. Not for the Holy Grail collection though.
Would you recommend this anime?
Yeah, if you’re stuck on what anime to watch sure. If you’ve got a friend you want to get into anime? Sure. If you’re looking for the next critically acclaimed anime? Nope, not even slightly.

                Review:
I actually started it awhile back with the first few episodes but then stopped. I finally got around to finishing it.
The story I think was pretty creative and very unique. The main character Saitama, or One Punch Man, seemed to be like a very simple, regular person who people didn't take very seriously (especially with his bald head).
It showed that looks are not everything to a person. You shouldn't underestimate who you are facing because they could very well have you meet your doom like One-Punch Man has made countless of others in this anime. (watch and you will see how)
At times in the anime,
                  there were some very funny parts which I enjoyed a lot. This anime brings in the humor, the ""don't judge a person from their looks"" standpoint, and just a very well thought character development.
Disappointment:
One thing I would like to say that I didn't totally love was the lack of satisfaction of everyone actually recognizing him at a very strong character and opponent. After thinking about it, I believe that it was One-Punch Man's character's choice to make it that way, which was very interesting.
Recommend? Yes!!!

                To start off this anime if you have not watched it yet, I strongly suggest you to watch. Although the plot may seem repetitive, it somehow draws you in to a feeling where you enjoy it even though it seems simple. The art for the characters are good, but my favorite part of the air is the simple yet hilarious faces saitama makes. This just shows sometimes the more simple things come out on top. Its hard to explain, but this anime is a definite watch for 12 episodes I was hooked the entire way and have been waiting for season 2 for so long.

                ~Introduction~
One Punch Man has been all over the anime community since it came out, and I can understand why. One Punch Man in my opinion is a good show, however, it came short in terms of the storyline and character development. I would have enjoyed being able to see more love put into this show as it had a great start and great ideas, but it really fell short while watching.
~Story~
In my opinion, the story of One Punch Man was great. Having this random guy have a passion for fighting crime and saving the Earth is quite basic, but they made this idea captivating and
                  different by purposefully making him over powered. Saying this, it is not an anime which is just the main character winning constantly. Saitama knows he's overpowered, and he knows he's strong. This is the part that I really enjoyed about the show, they go into how he gets bored over his ""fights"", he has dreams of fighting someone who is at his level and this makes the show overall different and entertaining. Saying this, the background and ideas of this show is amazing, but they lack in the actual storyline and storytelling. The first season is 12 episodes, but I think they have stretched this out quite a bit. Yes, they are only 20 minute episodes, but there are a lot of filler scenes and each scene goes for twice as long as it can or should. These 12 episodes should really only have been 6 or so, and I wished they could've filled the season with more character development, which leads me into the next segment of this review.
~Characters~
The Characters in One Punch Man have a great basis, however I do think they should have had a greater back story and more character development. For example Saitama one day comes across a monster and just decides to fight it because it was his ""dream as a child"" to become a hero. Yes this is just an anime and it is not real life, but it just seems random. We never see Saitama as a kid, we never see these three years of training and we never see his progress from being a regular office-job guy to an overpowered hero. I would have liked to see his struggles, I would have liked to see more detail into him as a person rather him as a hero. This goes for almost every character in One Punch Man, we barely see any history and if we do, it is nothing but a title compared to the backstories we see other characters in other animes/mangas. As well as the lack of backstories, One Punch Man has a lack of character development. We see Saitama and Genos together, but we never see them bond, and we *almost* never see them grow. Genos is probably the character who grows the most, however it is an elementary amount. The only REAL character development that occurs in the show is when Genos simply says he has grown and changed, but this change is the slightest amount, and you only notice it once it has been said.
~Art~
Usually in reviews, I would not include a whole section on Art, but One Punch Man is truly an exception. This artstyle in this anime is wonderful, I can not and could not find the words in the English dictionary to describe how talented the animators were. During most of the show, the animation is relatively normal for an anime of this sort, however the animation style completely changes in some cases. When there is a fight scene, it goes into this hardcore, detailed style and there is so much going on that I don't know where I am supposed to look. When there is a comedic moment, the animation changes to a basic, unique style that I have never seen before. If you enjoy seeing the artistic sides to anime, and enjoy the process of putting it all together, I would definitely recommend seeing One Punch Man as it is truly a piece of art.
~Overall~
Overall, One Punch Man does lack in some departments, however I fail to see the reason not to watch this anime. Yes, it has issues, yes, it has problems, but is it a bad anime? Not at all. I believe One Punch Man just needed some extra love and detail. Saying all of this, this is only the first season and having not watched the second season, I am excited about what is to come and how they hopefully dig deeper into these holes of missing information.",7,erinnorton80

                This is completely random but at the time of writing this One Punch Man has 1,777,777 members no joke. I don't know why I said that I just felt like it was important...
So as an otaku degenerate who just recently started working out in hopes that he could find love in a world were weeb society is frowned upon, but forgot that the most unattractive thing about otakus isn't their physique but their general existence and no amount of muscle will ever separate him and loneliness and he will probably die a virgin and- Wait what was I talking about? Oh right, One Punch Man.
                  So, as a bodybuilder wannabe, I came into this anime hoping for some quality muscle boiz, good workout techniques, and giant lasers that destroy the universe. This anime ended up delivering a lot of what I was expecting, and a lot of what I wasn't expecting. So let's get started with the great Kallocarina's One Punch Man review.
So let me tell you guys why this anime is absolute gold. The story is simple and pretty bonkers. It's all over the place which would normally bother me, but One Punch does it with such finesse and ingenuity that I love it. The world building is sporadic and confusing but I just can't get enough of it! Also on a completely random note I CRIED, IN THE FIRST EPISODE. For those of you that have read my reviews in the past, it is likely common knowledge that any anime that makes me cry has an almost guaranteed 9. The first episode is so absolutely ridiculous and hilarious that I started crying from laughter, and the rest of the series is a riot too. The art style works really well for the genre and, while I've always thought Madhouse animation was a bit overrated, I thought it was super creative and original. The OP is probably my favorite rock OP of all time and the ED is warm and fuzzy. A good method of calming down the reviewer after the insanity that is an episode of this show, only to have their brains exploded by the next one. The characters are awesome. All the girls are waifus (which is like, what, two?) and all the guys are Speedwagons. Saitama is a riot and every second he's on screen is either super epic or 5-star comedy (sometimes even both). This series was super fun to watch and I am so glad that I picked watching this instead of Sword Art Online or something stupid like that.
I don't really have all that much for negatives. The story could be better, the animation could be more detailed, the OST could be better, and a bunch of other stuff nobody cares about it. I did get tired at times but it was mostly late at night so I won't penalize too much for that.
All in all One Punch Man is really good. I totally get why it's #5 for most popular and it definitely deserves its top 100 position. I will say that it could have been funnier, and Saitama can feel quite out of character at times, but who cares? This anime is so unique and fun and hysterical that you need to have no sense of humor to not enjoy this show. I highly recommend it for both newbies and seasoned Otakus alike. I'm scared to see how J.C. Staff does the second season.

                You know this show, you've seen this show, you love this show. One Punch Man is one of those shows that got massive traction with mainstream audiences and I can totally get why. It's a subversion of the super hero genre by maxing the power of the hero to insane proportions. Having a character who's power is just destroying anyone with one punch does double duty. It provides excellent comedy because literally anything Saitama punches just dies but it also creates some interesting character building with Saitama. It's just not fulfilling for him to just end the fight so abruptly that it feels like Saitama
                  is cheating. While everyone else has to fight for their lives and earns the victories they get whereas Saitama is left feeling kinda empty after every fight. One Punch Man that has a reputation for being a comedy, which it is don't get me wrong but below that there's a bit more complexity to the show.",8,Rulerofpie

                ""What's so interesting about a guy that destroys everything with just one punch? I mean there can't be anything exciting about it right?"" - me, after a friend suggested me 'One Punch Man'
""Oh my god, this is amazing it is ... wow!"" - me, after I watched 'One Punch Man'
'One Punch Man' is that kind of anime that surprises you because you'd never expect an anime called 'One Punch Man' to be interesting in any way. But it is interesting because it doesn't really focus on the fight or on how strong Saitama is, it focuses on how Saitama gets bored because there is no
                  worthy opponent, it focuses on how people react on someone this strong and how other heroes treat him and what they think. 
This anime has got everything, awesome fights, a great sense of humour, and of course some love (ok, that's a lie, there is no love ... yet). 
The only sad thing about everything is that there are only 12 episodes. But luckily a second season has been announced.
I highly recommend watching 'One Punch Man' because, keeping it simple, it is great.",10,Erayserbeam

                10/10 it's a mastuhpeece.
I don't know that I would hold this show in such high regard if I didn't have such a personal history with it. You see I did a mission trip back in 2014 where for the next couple years I basically had no access to TV or any kind of media at all. I was really into Naruto when I left, reading the manga as it came out, and I had a number of other series under my belt but I had never really taken that deep dive into becoming the full on 70 episodes a week weeb that I am now.
                  When I got back from that mission trip I had basically lost all interest in anime related things, I didn't know what any of these new shows were and Naruto's manga had ended.
This show changed all that when bright-eyed and amazed I realized that anime could actually be good. You see I was taking some college classes and a few of my roommates happened to be talking about anime. 2016 was a hot year for anime stepping into the mainstream, because Netflix was adding more and more of them and pushing people my age who'd never seen anime before to discover it. I heard shows like Attack on Titan and Sword Art Online name dropped all the time. I don't know what led me to pick One Punch Man in particular, but I'm so glad I did.
Enough about how I discovered it, though; what makes the show great? Well, in short: Dragon Ball Z. For me this show was the perfect answer to Dragon Ball and Yu Yu Hakusho and other fight anime where characters have to get stronger. It's the logical conclusion where you take a guy who is so far at the top of his game that the game got boring. What would Goku do if there were no more strong guys to fight, become a radish farmer? That sounds boring and dumb, which is exactly what Saitama thinks of the world now that he's the strongest in it.
But the joke that is Saitama wouldn't carry a series like this on it's own. It would be funny for an episode or two at best, but it'd get old pretty quick if it was just him. He's strong, he beats the bad guy in one punch, you get it. What shoots this show up so far into the masterpiece zone for me is the inclusion of so many memorable side-characters. Each one, Genos, Mumen Rider, Bang, the gay one, on their own would make for such amazing and powerful stories of triumph over adversity and the will to never give up. That combined with the true character of Saitama, letting others take credit for the heroic acts he's done because he knows what's truly important about being a hero, aw it's just so good.
The villains are great, the way the bluster and boast about how amazing and strong they are before getting absolutely bodied is always funny, but I think the real antagonist is the hero's journey itself. Saitama basically skipped to the end of the typical story circle and it's now traveling it backward, waiting for everyone else to catch up and maybe meet him in the middle. He's on NewGame+ and he's just waiting for the part of the game where monsters start getting hard again, which may not even come because he's also probably still getting stronger. The fight with Boros is an obvious highlight of the show as well, where you think that Saitama might actually have to try a little bit but it turns out he was holding back even for that.
I would be remiss not to talk about the art style and animation overall. This is movie quality stuff and really shows what you can do with a well paid team of freelance artists who aren't under massive time-constraints. I've seen plenty of shows end up looking awful because they obviously didn't take the time necessary to let the artists work, the tragic reality being that most studios aren't willing to pay enough artists or give them enough time because at the end of the day they need to turn a profit on this thing and it's never going to get done if you don't set deadlines. The art here shows none of that so kudos to the whole team behind this project. Amazing work all around.
So yeah this show is super good. It's what got me back into anime, because after watching it I was inspired to finally dive head first into about a dozen other series recommended to me by friends and roommates. I had so many recommendations that I eventually created a txt file on my desktop to keep track of all of them, which evolved into the list I used to start my account on this website.

                This is anime is brilliant in its own sense.
This anime is supposed to be a parody of other shounen anime but at the same time, it’s one of them (even though it’s seinen). This is what makes this anime so brilliant, the fact that it can be watched on these two different “levels”, or somewhere between. 
Story: 9
The story is pretty straightforward, there are usually just problems that the characters face and solve in one or two episodes. The only thing prevalent throughout the whole anime is the climbing of the ranks of heroes. Even though it’s always obvious how it’s going to end, I
                  still think the process of getting there is very interesting. It’s the way characters interact with each other, which can be absurd, funny, or even serious and you never know what it will be. There are also instances of actual problems this anime is trying to show, which are not hard to spot and are also a very accurate representation of the real world. 
What I found most unique to this anime is how it depicts the Saitama in the most common situation doing the most common things, while living in the most dangerous part of town. I think this contrast alone is how the show feels overall.
Characters: 8
The characters in this anime are its strong side just as much as its weak side. They are probably the main source of its parody and comedy. Although I can’t really say what is each character supposed to be a parody of I can see how it’s portrayed and know this is not just a normal character. The main flaw with the characters is that not a lot of them get to develop and if they do it’s usually on a scale that is just unsatisfiable. This is actually not a big problem as the show has only 12 episodes but could be a serious one later as the anime continues.
Another thing is the dialogues, they tend to be short, without any unnecessary words, and they go right to the problem.
Art: 10
The overall art of this anime is very basic just like Saitama, it’s nothing special but still pretty nice. Although I don’t care as much about the animation I can say that I liked how the fights were animated. Anyways, I didn’t find any problems with the art.
Sound: 9
I think the sound effects were decent, the voice acting was done very well. The most important for is music, and I found the music here very fresh, the music was always on the same page as the scenes and it also added another layer to the scenes making them either more realistic or just more interesting.
Enjoyment: 10
Even though this anime doesn’t have a long-lasting plot and is basically episodic, I must say I don’t know why but I enjoyed It very much and always wanted to watch another episode. I think the anime is funny and has a very nice atmosphere, which makes It pleasant to watch.
Overall: 9
All in all, this show has a very good quality and is very enjoyable, although I can see how it may not suit everyone.",9,TejkyS

                Hello all. Sorry about my english, its not my native language. 
This is my first review ever, and i decided to do it because no one said what i really think about this show. 
Story 3/10: A guy who blow everyone with a single punch. That´s all. 
Art 9/10: Its good as many other new animes. Was the reason i start watching it to be honest, and well, all the hype around it, i wanted to check it by myself. 
Sound 7/10: Like Art, is good as many other animes. 
Character 3/10: Well, there´s no character development. Genos is a cool guy who cares and
                  wants to be better. Saitama is the typical idiot who don´t know nothing about what happens around him and has an ordinary life. 
Enjoyment 5/10: Well, i have to confess, i enjoyed  some moments of the anime, wouldn't fair if i didn't say that, but i had a lot of boring moments as well. 
Overall 6/10: I can't understand all the hype around this anime, and after seeing the show i still don´t get it. Is for sure, the most overrated anime i've ever seen. Ok, there's shows to every taste, this is supposed to be humor i guess...but i laugh twice. On first episode when the crab guy explained how he became a....crab guy, and when he explained how he became so powerfull. Running 10Km.....100 lifts, etc etc. 
Maybe im being a litle rough with this show because i was so disapointed  after seeing it. Second season promises being different, perhaps introducing a decent story, even some character development. That would be crazy in a show so well rated, can you imagine how astounishing it would be? 
Seriously guys, you should stop giving 10/10 ratings on this show, and start thinking twice before rating new shows again.",6,Ultreisse

                One Punch Man is a shounen anime (geared towards young male audiences, I believe) that is a manga adaptation of the original shounen manga. Overall, this anime scores a 8 on my list, and I'll be covering each category in the review.
Story: 6
Oh boy, the messiest part of all my reviews. Don't hate me, I'm already doing that.
One Punch Man tells the story of Saitama, a guy who's ""just a hero for fun."" After a climactic event when he was 19 years old, he forced himself through an intense training regimen of push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and running for three years. The result is a bald
                  22 year-old man who can finish anything with a single punch.
The story itself is pretty basic. You have an overpowered god-like protagonist, a bunch of supporting characters, and a huge list of generic villains. Over 12 episodes, the protagonist goes on and beats every one of them, sometimes stalling and making the fights drag on until he decides to attack, sometimes ending his opponent's life before they can even get through their pre-battle speeches. Typical shounen story, with a bit of plot being introduced every episode only for it to be washed away along with each ""boss"" that Saitama kills.
It's not bad, but it's not exactly out there. If you want story, go somewhere else. One Punch Man will give you action and comedy every episode, but don't expect huge plot twists or a complete lack of inconsistency.
There's enough humor to keep this show going, with a lot of recycled cliches and jokes, but they're not just the same thing thrown at you over and over. Through all the stage drama over dangerous enemies and climactic build-ups ending on a typical one-shotted by baldy, there's always some sort of joke about Saitama's overwhelming strength to bring it all full circle. As I read in some other review, this anime always starts and ends with Saitama's boring life, even after an alien invasion.
Also, the story is wrapped up in a rather messily wrapped up conclusion. There's a couple things that weren't covered during the show itself, and it just seems rushed and cut-off in general. Maybe they'll finish it up in a second season or specials or OVA, who knows, but as a standalone series this anime has a typical shounen story with a couple plotholes and unseen to details, blah blah, TLDR they rushed the ending and it wasn't as bad as say, Charlotte, but it was still rushed.
Art: 9
The artstyle fits the show. One Punch Man is an anime with a focus not on story but action. Just from watching one episode, it's already clear that the art was adapted from a manga; the environment is well-made and realistic, but is subtle enough to not take attention away from the characters.
The characters themselves have great design. Each character is given remarkable detail and it's clear that the artists have eyes for proportion and consistency. Every character, the exclusions being the generic civilians and monsters and whatnot, is given unique physical traits. Even for the characters that you don't know the name of, you'll recognize them by their faces.
Also, the action is nice. The effects are good, the energy-trails from running is nice, and the fight scenes are choreographed quite well and absorbingly.
Sound: 9
The sound effects are fitting and never seem out of place. The music during the episodes themselves is subtle, and does a great job of setting an atmosphere for a scene without interrupting too much. The sounds are noticeable, crystal clear, and simple yet reasonable. Not much else to say about that.
The opening and ending themes are in stark contrast. While the OP music is a fitting theme song for a hero whose attack stat is over nine thousand, the ED music is simple and calm, the tune being overlooked in favor of the catchy enough OP.
Character: 7
As for character design, I talked about it briefly earlier. Each character is memorable and unmistakable for another. The physical features for every character are unique, consistent, and the like.
When it comes down to what's beneath the surface, what's important to note is that there's barely any backstory for any character. The exception to this is Genos, who pours out his soul to Saitama in the second episode. Besides that, no character has any real story. Disregarding the small details that can be learned from careful observation, we don't know anything about anyone when it comes to personal life. The characters are recognizable only because of their powers and appearance.
On the other hand, if Madhouse tried to give each supporting character and villain a proper backstory, the anime would probably stretch on for about 20 more arcs or so, so.. To say the least, good job on keeping it short.
Enjoyment: 9
I liked this show. It's short, I pretty much watched the entire thing in one morning, and it isn't even noon while I'm writing this. The story is nonexistent, but the episodic action and scenes are decent enough to make it a fun anime to watch.
Overall: 8
As with most of my reviews, I dance about each topic and miss a lot of things. There's a lot of redundancies in my reviews, but you get the general gist. Here's a summary for anyone who can't understand my butterfly style of writing.
-Basic shounen story, nothing special about it. Barely any serious plot and characters, and the villains might as well all look the same, but it's got enough weight to keep it somewhat new.
-Great art and sound, fitting for the anime. Clearly makes this show stand out as a manga adaptation, and on the aesthetic side, this anime is excellent. Madhouse does not disappoint!
-Most likely a hit or miss, from what I've seen from other reviews. Either love it or hate it, this show will either seem like complete trash or great stuff, it's different for everybody.",8,Symantra

                When the hero can beat all the enemies that he faces a story gets boring and repetitive.
The rest of the characters are actually decent, some even very interesting but the main character takes away all the fun and suspense by removing the need for them to do anything.
Main character is also very predictable as you can always guess what he is going to say or do next. By not being unexpected at all this also makes the comedy they try to make not so funny at all. You know it's not a great anime when it feels like it would actually be better without the

With this anime, I feel like the creators have created a world where anything can happen.  They have created a protagonist who is one of the most memorable and likeable that I've come across.  Saitama, the main character, is such a well developed person (through great character development) that you root for him throughout his day.

What I disliked about the anime - 
1 - The show didn't live up to the hype, like I said at the start, the show wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be.
2 - Some of the jokes used in the show kind of seemed to be recycled at times.

A great anime that breaks all of the anime tropes that are overused in this day and age. The characters that are shown are all interseting but are not developted and more often than not I feel as if Saitama(the main character) has never been developted as a character. His mentality however is put in light really well but the character himself is nearly a stranger, the audience knowing nearly nothing about him. I hope that he will be development later on. 
And about the 8 I gave to the story, the only reason is because (this is a personal opinion) I would
                  like to see more of a plotline. I know that season 2 has one but the first season even tough it's superior in terms of animation, I think it really needed one.

                How can you not like an anime about a guy who can defeat anyone, sounds like it’ll get boring, doesn’t it? It doesn’t, it is hilarious. With awesome animation and character interactions that leave you rolling on the floor, this anime was destined for success.
Story – 7
It’s average; it’s a basic hero story. The catch is that the main character can beat anyone, in any fight. This is a basic premise by itself, but it somehow avoids being boring. Although you know that the main character is going to win, there is still a sense of urgency or worry in any situation.

                Very good. Well above average.
Wrong is thinking about taking the anime seriously, imagining it to be a work of high complexity or something. The anime, in what it lends itself to do, is great. From the first to the last episode is great.
Extremely well-done animation, well-done plot, good characters, gigantic monsters, and obvious, that classic touch of humor that leaves every anime more enjoyable to watch.
The anime is simple, the plot is not exaggerated and the fights are predictable. And yes, even if they are predictable, they are far from bad.
Our protagonist, Saitama, at certain moments, reminds us of the late Golden Boy. His humor,
                  in the measure, is very tasty and makes us laugh properly, without exaggeration, or sounding forced.
The anime still casts several references, such as Chaves (series), Dragon Ball (Piccolo) among others. Fantastic for any fan of culture in general.
Anyway, One Punch Man is definitely, with merits, one of the coolest anime in recent years. It's a show, a production fun. It deserves all the praise.",8,Hygor_DDL

                One Punch Man may be one of the funniest anime i’ve ever seen.
There isn’t any real story behind it, in the beginning its mostly just One Punches and nothing more, as the story progresses there is a bit more story in the serie but there isn’t a story like Naruto or Bleach. The idea of a simple looking guy being the strongest man alive is pretty funny, the way how he is so strong is ridiculous. One Punch Man is a not that serious type of anime and thats what makes it fun. The show is simply made without even thinking about serious things, the
                  show isn’t a Naruto like show where the story goes on and on but every episode is different so we’re never getting a cliffhanger. Probably soon the next season will be announced for One Punch Man",10,KaneUchiha13

                One punch man , as the name implies its about a man who can defeat any enemy with only one punch .
""sound pretty cool right? a man who can defeat anyone with one punch ? "" is what I thought within the first few episodes . 
This without doubt is a very strong production (of a could have been great anime ) but disappointment  hits when you realize that the only thing this anime has is an Idea it was funny at the beginning but started to become very boring .
lets begin the review 
 *story : 3/10* (the original idea was good, but
                  in action it become boring for lack of new ideas)
In a world where heroes are needed to defeat the monsters that are invading earth everyday. In this world we see the adventures of Saitama or more like his daily life where he throws a single punch to defeat the monsters .
*Art:4/10*
personally one of the things that made me not watch this anime sooner was the art in short I appreciate good art and this was not for me .
*sound: 8/10*
*characters: 2/10*
pros :  funny ,the lead charachter has ""dont care"" vibe and his facial expressions 
cracks me up 
cons: no developments in characters whats so ever , Lack of backstories , predictable actions.
*Enjoyment: 1/10*
honestly at around episode 6 I was forcing my self to finish this , same fights same outcome same winner but different types of monsters and same FACE . very repetitive and predictable

                ""Hero.""
What a word. Or rather... what a person.
A little backstory. Yesterday, when I was watching terrible anime like Skelter Heaven all the way up to Mars of Destruction. I was boring myself to death, wondering why it was ever a good idea to do that to myself. I felt dead inside, and felt like anime was no longer good in my heart. I was... EMPTY.
However... something clicked in my mind. About what was missing.
Then it hit me: I never..actually watched One Punch Man before. See, when this anime came out, I wasn't with the hype, maybe I was too busy watching Shippuden, I'm not sure.
                  But something about this white-caped yellow-wearing hero with a bald head intrigued me. Maybe it was the memes? I'm not sure either, but I knew for sure, he was kinda weird to look at. I mean, I already thought he was Superman the moment I laid eyes on him.
Nevertheless, after leaving the horrendous piece of anime known as Hanoka. I finally went to my favorite site and watched episode 1. That was yesterday, and now it is 5pm in the afternoon, and I had just watched Episode 12. 
I'm feeling it now, Mr. Krabs.
Story 9/10:
To put it simply, the pacing was just right. There were some moments sure, where it would be kinda repetitive, you would have the villains being revealed to you, as well as the first heroes coming in, and then news reports come in, for Saitama to probably witness so that he go into action. But, that would be oversimplifying it. See, events happened in such a way that left me with no complaints at all. Everything felt natural, flowed natural, even better than what I was expecting. If there was any common complaint One Punch Man would ever get was through its theme, but that's probably just a hater's comment. Because just because it's a superhero story, it doesn't mean that's all there is.
Art 10/10:
Where do I even start? I remember back then researching about this particular anime and its origin, it shocked me for sure but it was also a humble beginning for Mr. One. And seeing the anime, he must be proud, probably had more emotion than Saitama ever did fighting boring villains. Because fights were intense, for sure. And the art did it JUSTICE. Pun intended.
Sound 10/10:
If I were to tell you about sound design, we could be here for hours. But no complaints either, in fact I don't even have to say much. Timing was definitely something this particular anime achieved with its moments, you have moments where they are running at the speed of light, and then you have the music hyping you up. Whoever was in charge of the sound should do more, that's incredible. Great work on that. And that opening, I could say it was awesome, but watching the anime through each episode and hearing that opening after an intro scene. It really describes Saitama as a character, and what he represents.
Character 9/10:
You might be suprised I gave this a 9. I'll explain why. One thing, this anime achieved was designs, but character is a bit of a stretch. Some villains were generic, yes they were made fun for being that way, but still generic. You could maybe, like some of them. But some of them, definitely felt more similar than I thought. Even Saitama himself noticed that. That being said, each character still had great design thanks to the art. Some were funny, weird, but I think that's the point. It made for great comedy, too. Considering all the comments Saitama himself would say in every scene. And everytime he opened his mouth? You were always listening. That's an interesting main character right there. The heroes were interesting, and each had their own goals, as well as personalities.
Enjoyment 9/10:
I don't think I have to say much considering the stuff I've already said above, so let's skip to Overall. One word about my enjoyment: Hype. Yes, and funny. Wait, that's two words. Ah, whatever.
Overall 9/10:
This is a great anime. You will laugh, you will cry, and will learn by the numbers about what being a hero is all about. 
I still look back on my old days being a Naruto fan, and I always wondered why. This anime reminded me. Sometimes hype isn't bad, sometimes it's the push. It's the PUNCH, so to speak. Is this anime overhyped? definitely. Does it make it bad? No. This anime was EVEN better than I thought it was. But that's the first season. But that's a tremendously good start that even the end still left me happy. Go watch it, it's good... probably. I don't know, if you read my review, it probably is, right? Go ahead, watch it. You're annoying me now. Just kidding.",9,KiroTheAssassin

                If you want OP characters that don't stretch fights and episodes with emotional and unneeded pleonasm, this is the anime for you. Although flaws are something I admire in characters, Saitama literally being perfect yet so humble and normal about it is something I adore. His character is just so relatable in a way, like the goofy yet unmoved person you know that doesn't bother anyone. The supporting characters also have their own animated personalities you only want more of each episode, plus they are attractive. Even though I personally am not attracted to men, I like whenever animes actually give male characters good design
                  and give them good looking qualities and personalities rather than making them basic and douchey, which OPM achieves in .(making the characters look good, not basic and douchey.) Overall Recommend if you just want an action and comedy anime to watch after a long day at school or work :).",10,GudakotheFeared

                This review contains spoilers
When I was younger, I often kept my big mouth shut because I knew I would be ostracised by my friends and classmates at school for saying that Superman isn't as awesome as people think he is.... How can any sensible person call him overpowered if a piece of glowing green rock can bring him down to his knees. This sole fact made me so anxious that even if Superman shifted the moon from its orbit... It always felt like he was just a rock away from getting defeated. And since I was like the only 2000s kid who hadn't seen any
                  Dragon Ball stuff... I had never had the chance of seeing a ""good"" overpowered character. I added ""good"" because I have seen Lucy from Elfen Leid. 
Enter One Punch Man. A 2015 anime made by Studio Madhouse based on a manga by ONE and Yusuke Murata. I wanted to see the show because of its insanely high critic scores and the ""shounen killer"" tag attached to it. Since I am writing the review 2 years after seeing the show. I ask the reader 
to pardon me If I missed any minor detail. 
The story is really simple. A guy who wanted to become a superhero trained hard for it and he became one. That's the first major thing I like about the anime. There are no signs of ""the chosen one"" cliché. Saitama isn't like Midoriya who was chosen by All Might to become a successor. ( Don't get me wrong. I love MHA too.). In the world of OPM this power isn't exclusive to Saitama. Anyone can become as strong as him if he trained like him. This of course hasn't happened to anyone besides Saitama but this hasn't been proved wrong yet too. Saitama trained and trained and became ""the strongest man"" .... Which coincidentally is the title of the first episode. He defeats everyone with One Punch and saves the day every week. Sounds simple Right?.... Cause it is.... There is nothing more to it.... I understand that the show is a parody and the focus is more on the characters and themes.....but I do feel that the story felt kinda hollow in the show except for episodes 1,3,7,9,12 where great stuff was actually happening on screen. 
The good news is..... That is the only flaw I found in OpM. So read further only If you are interested in knowing the good stuff in it. 
Saitama is powerful... I mean really powerful. There is no creature in the known universe who can even damage a hair on his body ( If he had any). In most of the anime, if the protagonist possesses great powers.... It is usually accompanied by a sense ot pride and superiority complex. Examples include Light, Lelouch, Bakugo,..... So the logical circuits in my brain told me that maybe Saitama would turn out to be the same.... Cause this troupe isn't stopped by a parody anime tag..... But no.... This guy is as humble as humans can be.. He has zero sense of ego and pride. He has achieved all power in the world but still wants to do something meaningful in life. For other shounen heroes... Becoming strong is the goal. For Saitama,.... Power is just the means to achieve his goals. You know why he never became famous in the show despite his feats... Because he doesn't give a damn about getting something in return for his efforts. He is the personification of the quote ""work hard in silence and let success be your noise"". He doesn't care if anyone is watching him do good unlike All might who cares about signing autographs as much as catching the bad guys. This sense of humility is hard to find in anime characters let alone real people. Midoriya comes close but one cannot brush off the fact that he too wanted to become a superhero because he wanted the fame and glory all might had at under his belt. 
Genos is another character who puts other shounen protagonists to shame by actually doing stuff instead of just taking about doing stuff done. In the entire Hero Association.... He is the only one who knows the true strength of Saitama and has therfore nothing to worry about when faced with a monster..... But does it stop him from doing his best and trying to defeat the monsters without being reliant on his master Saitama? 
..... Of course not..... Genos is like that one kid who knows all the cheat codes for a game but still prefers not using them cause that's what real players do. The upgrades which he gets in the show over time are an excellent representation of him becoming stronger unlike the shows where they just lengthen the protagonist's hair. They also served as logical proof of his learning curve and him being better at fighting compared to the last time he was on field. 
Another area where the show needs to take a bow from me is portraying deep themes in a parody anime. Saitama was assigned to class C in the hero association test despite the fact that he could kill the entire association in his sleep. Doesn't it eerily remind us of something?. Yes..... Our education system. How we judge kids based on a single performance/test. It doesn't matter if the kid has many more talents hidden under him. No one cares. The system just categorises them into groups so that they need not put any more effort to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each child individually 
ONE portrayed Saitama as a bald guy not because it was funny.... But because he wanted him to boast an everyman appeal. Creating a handsome superhero only deepens the insecurities of the average guy watching the show. In fact.... Wishful thinking is the cause of all insecurities. Just imagine how bad would an average anime viewer feel if he ever compared himself to Mary Sue characters such as Kirito. 
Neither Marvel nor DC had the guts to create superheroes who are openly gay.... As if it's a crime to be one. But this show did. Even though the culture of Japan is comparatively more homophobic than the West. 
In episode 9, when Mumen Rider refused to give up despite knowing that he would never win against the Sea King.......It is genuinely inspiring and made me much more emotional than many ""tearjerker"" anime did.
And I am thankful to this scene for debunking one of my least favourite shounen clichés which is the power of friendship. It's hard to describe the scene in its full glory over text. But the resolve and determination shown by him during that scene was as big a spectacle of the show as any of the glorious fights of  Saitama or Genos. 
In the series finale, the season's toughest antagonist Boros challenges Saitama to a Fight because he wanted a tough opponent. It is later revealed that Saitama was holding back the entire time and the fight would have been over in the characteristic one punch of Saitama..... But Saitama played along because he knew that this was probably the last fight of Boros' life and he wanted to give Boros the fight of his life. One which he could go all out. It was because Saitama himself wanted to face such an opponent where he could use all of his strength but since his wish remained unfulfilled even after the show he didn't let Boros die with the same dissatisfaction. Now this is some truly deep conviction showed by Saitama. Maybe that's why he is never leaving my favourite characters list on my MAL profile. 
The music in the show is astounding. The opening is so hype it can revive corpses.... Just kidding... But it is something worth mentioning.... Saitama's theme is so great that it can go with almost anything with slight alterations... Such as the soft piano version in Mumen Rider vs Seaking fight or the heavy metal version in Saitama vs Boros fight. I have absolutely no complaints about the music in the show. 
The art and animation of the show is amazing. Yes I know I am the millionth person to say that but it truly is. The fights are so fluid that it feels like you are watching a video game cutscene. Of course most of them aren't Saitama's cause they last even less than an old man in bed. Saitama's Cape had more physics in the anime than enitre fights in other bland battle shounens. The fight between Saitama and Boros and the one between Mosquito Lady and Genos werr very well animated. Even Murata would be proud.
The colours used in the anime are very vibrant and vivid. It really shows that Shingo Natsume and his animators put their heart and soul into it. 
Coming to Enjoyment..... Where to begin.... The show picks up pace from the very first shot so you never feel like you ever left. The comedy in the show is funnier than many ""comedy"" anime out there.. Comedy anime rarely make me laugh out loud and OPM is no exception but in relative terms... It does deliver.. I never blinked or looked away from the screen in some episodes cause believe me they were that good. And a short span of 12 episodes never leaves any room for boredom to settle down. 
Overall. the unique nature of the show combined with its capabilities of killing shonen troupes makes One Punch Man not just a show but an experience..... I proudly list it as one ot my most favourite anime ever and definitely the best superhero show i have ever seen.. 
That's it from me..... Adieu",9,VineetOfCulture

                Out of all the anime which we watch, most of them are forgotten, some of them we manage to rewatch, some of them we call masterpieces and leave it at that but only very few leave a lasting impact. Personally, for me, Naruto, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and One Punch Man have been the lasting ones. Even though I don't call the first 2 masterpieces, the third is definitely, IMO, one.
*Spoiler Territory* 
The criticism for this show is that most episodes on the surface are indistinguishable and the jokes get repetitive and unfunny. Also, for the ones who have taken it quite literally, the superhero has
                  no logic and is totally unrelatable. However, what most people miss the point is that this show is a parody. Most shounen shows end when the superhero is at God level and there is no major conflict. Does it make jokes on it? Check. The superhero has motivations ranging from revenge to respect. Joke cracked? Check. Too much talk no Jutsu? Check. At its core, the show is about how the main quality of a hero is not its quirks and skills, but the ability to stand in face of death. Metal Knight ran when his rockets failed versus the meteor but Mumen Rider stood tall even when he was bashed to near death. These examples highlight how deep and simple throughout the message was, ""what its like to be a hero?"" Saitama for all his powers never looked down once at those who tried. Borus and Mumen both got the respect from him. It also comments on mob mentality and how fickle our perception and ratings are. Saitama is not the hero of the show, its, in my opinion, the people around him who really are. Even the importance of friendship, highlighted through Saitama and Genos show how one is truly happy when not alone. Saitama is just a hero for fun, he doesn't need the fame and fortune for motivation, he just needs the thrill and respect from his peers.
*Over*
ART:
The art of the show is fantastic. The fight scenes at times take your breath away while the comedy moments have enough creativity to make you giggle. It's unreal to see the transformation of Saitama's face in different situations which definitely deserves extra praise.
SOUND:
The opening grows on you and the lyrics are even better. The other sounds are so-so but the real MVP is the fight sequence music. Its unreal how it raises you and even pits you against Saitama in the final fight. The music uplifts your heart and meloncholy and gives you that godly punch.
CHARACTER:
Saitama is an amazing character. The way in which he gets dissapointed after every fight and how he gives zero fucks to any challenge is mind boggling. Genos is your usual shounen hero who cannot comprehend wth is going on. Mumen rider is Captain America in every sense. The rest are well written. However, we do deserve a good villian which this show definitely lacked.

                Saitama is a very nice character. The first season of this series is very good. We are watching the hobby of a very strong character. While I don't really like things like superheroes protecting the world, a character like Saitama is really interesting. I wonder why it's so powerful, but 1.They don't say anything other than that he says he played sports during the season. Before Genos became involved in Saitama's life, things weren't all that good. Genos is a good apprentice.The action scenes are very good. and the motivation of the bad characters is average. It's a beautiful production where comedy and fight go

Story: 6
It feels like One Punch Man doesn't really have a plot right now, the story isn't going anywhere specific. Hero Association and Hero Ranks and all that are perhaps supposed to be the backbone but honestly they weren't vital at least for this season.
OPM is like a sitcom meets superheroes where we get to observe Saitama's daily life and adventures. He's a carefree, sarcastic guy and the OPM world is full of interesting heroes and villains for him to interact with. Since the show is more about the characters than an ""overall story"", I think this rating is kind of
                  irrelevant.  
Art: 9
OPM's fight scenes is one of its strongest points, the animation is absolutely top notch during them. The show also does a nice job at using visuals to enhance the humor. Although these type of switches in animation quality really annoyed me in a show like FMAB, it works very well here since OPM never takes itself too seriously.
Sound: 9
Not much to say here. The soundtrack is quite good, especially the OP song. Many of the ambiance tracks are worth putting in regular playlists.
Character: 9
Don't be fooled by their goofy names. They may not have much depth but even the villains who played the smallest parts are brilliant and memorable. If you have seen this show, you won't easily forget about Sea King, Mosquito Girl, Beast King, Armored Gorilla, Carnage Kabuto, Hammerhead, Boros and many others. Same goes for the heroes. The show is great at introducing colorful characters with unique traits.
Obviously there's also Saitama, probably the funniest character design I've ever seen. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much watching a show/movie/whatever and Saitama is a big part of it. The guy just wants a decent opponent! The hot cyborg Genos also plays an important role, representing the generic selfless superhero for contrast. Their weird master-student relationship is a very nice addition to the story.
Enjoyment: 9
Despite disliking most comedy shows, I really enjoyed One Punch Man. I can def...

                Finally!  An anime that doesn't take itself too seriously.  No angst ridden teenagers trying to hand out life lessons in the form of a bad guy beat down.  Just a regular joe with slightly above average ambitions opening a giant can of whoop-ass on some bad mofos.  I love it.  It's got no pretensions of being a Doctor Phil dressed up in a superhero costume (thank God!).
What I also love about this anime/manga are the insane fight scenes.  Have you ever seen fight scenes this hardcore?!  This is some serious sh*t!
Oh and the plethora of bad guys/good guys!
                   So much creativity!  It's not just the same old constipated energy ball being excreted from a 'roid injected, white eyed angry superhero.  There are some really creative superpowers.  Think Mosquito Lady, Super Robocop, Bat-the-devil-out-of-you-man and, of course, our beloved OPM.

                This is an enjoyable anime for sure. It makes fun of cliches from super hero and animes alike by having the main protagonist as the most powerful super hero also be the most anti-dramatic character in spite every other character being so hyped. 
The characters in the anime are all very unique, most are very interesting. The main character would actually be among the least interesting as far as story goes, which is just one of the jokes the anime has going for it. His character is just a super hero for fun, but he has the tragic tale of being bored with his power
                  and wanting more. That would be the gist of it without spoiling anything else.
As he continues to his path of being a super hero, the show makes some of the same jokes over and over again. They do not get super stale to where it's a huge problem, but it is a noticeable weakness that will likely not work for a second season. Some of the characters are also ridiculous, which might be intentional but some of them has a role for such a long period of time that I feel it's bad design to make their existence as a joke and then have them have a serious enough role to where you need to see them frequently, it's just a joke that only hurts the character that isn't funny at that point. 
Without revealing too much, One Punch Man is not a good story based anime. It has a story that's just above mediocre. It's story is interesting because of the character, not because of the story. The anime is more of a comedy than anything and should be taken as so, but with some of the core jokes being recycled, the anime is more amusing and enjoyable rather than a hilarious and exciting experience. 
It's a good anime that I both enjoyed and recommend, it's just not a masterpiece.",8,RexDraco

                It's a feel good anime. That's it. That's the review.
Alternative one-word review: Simple.
Don't contribute to the tissue paper paranoia in the pandemic just yet--it's not heart wrenching nor is it THAT funny. It's as I've said--it'll make you feel good. It's something that you can watch to feel relaxed without being too overwhelmed about any suspense that may happen (hint: there aren't any, at least in my opinion).
My second point is that the whole anime is simple. It really just is--simple shonen-marketed plot, simple message, simple style, simple characters. This isn't really that bad for those who are into more complex themes. Sometimes you have
                  to remember that while looking outside the box is necessary for further survival, the box is there for a reason. Don't forget that complexities in life exist with the simplicities, and both are worth paying equal attention to.",8,AoiHonou

                When it comes to parodying a certain anime genre, it can be difficult to get right. One Punch Man does this extremely well. It parodies the Shonen fighting anime like DBZ and One Piece. With its fast paced battle sequences, to the sheer ridiculousness of some of the characters and their powers, even an anime as over the top as this one can be considered good. So the stories are good and the fights are good, but how are the characters? Well they are pretty enjoyable too. The Main character is Saitama who by the ending of season 1 will convince you that no one
                  in the shows universe can defeat him in a fight. Overpowered characters in anime can be handled awfully, Zoro from One Piece isn't that bad in this category. Natsu from Fairy Tail is pretty bad. but Ayato from the asterisk war is probably the worst one in the category of overpowered characters. Saitama however is an overpowered character done right. Why, cause the whole world around him sees him as a no good cheater. Even all the heroes (Besides Genos and Bang) don't see him as anything special. The other characters are also a lot of fun. Genos is a decently fun character with interesting powers. Bang is a wise old man who thankfully hasn't trained Saitama, Cause that would be an overused trope in the shonen genre. Tornado is a spoiled brat and Puri Puri Prisoner is the over the top gay character of this anime. Normally this would turn me off from any series. But since One Punch Man is incredibly weird it just adds to that weirdness of the anime. I'd say if you want to see parodying done right then watch One Punch Man. It'll surely give you what you've been looking for.",9,DragonSword129

                Starting from the very title, One-Punch Man is, well, exactly what it is. There is no plot or intricate story to be discovered; it’s a series about a man who only punches once and wins. The exact same thing happens in every episode, until the very last one where he...  
There is little character development for the protagonist:  He is the character the least attention is being paid to. He goes about his day being bored, destroying villains for fun, going to buy groceries, and then waking up the next day to do the same thing. And that’s pretty much everything. And that's
                  exactly what makes it so much fun to watch.
However, One-Punch Man doesn't need a strong story. It's funny and diversified jokes keep the viewer entertained every episode without making it boring. Using all kinds of humor give it a lively feeling. Anecdotes, Fantasy, Insult, Irony, Jokes, Observational, Quote, Role play, Self deprecation, Vulgarity, Wordplay and a lot more is the series formally exploiting. Whatever you do, this show will get you off-guard.
The art of the show varies between awe-aspiring action animation and blank inanimate shots of Saitama’s emotionless face and typical blank stare, adding to the contrast between himself and everything else. It demonstrates that the reason why he moves and acts so little is a choice, not a limitation. The opening theme ‘THE HERO!!’ by JAM PROJECT is intense and memorable, building up an expectation that is about to be destroyed upon watching the very first minute of each episode. The voice acting follows the style of the art, jumping from ultimate to zero intensity and destroying any sort of potential climax. All these choices make One-Punch Man much more conceptual rather than aesthetic; an unconventional style that is not very often seen in anime, but very suitable here.
One-Punch Man is the anime you need to watch if you’re tired of watching anime. It’s revolutionary, refreshing, and original. It’s like nothing that has ever been made before, especially in that perfection.",8,Keita2014

                Story: The story is literally about a overpowered superhero who wants to find a challenge as defeating enemies with one punch has gotten boring and He wishes to find someone who will give him a challenge. The story is also a joke on your average shounen characters seeing that majority of them never die or Lose a battle. Overall the comedy is satire and Isn't really meant to be taken seriously. 
Art: The art style is the best thing about One Punch Man, as every scene is filled with vivid colors as well as clean and perfected animation. The anime is honestly top tier!
Sound: The
                  best way to describe One Punch Man in sound is "" The Wave and The Calming "" As the intro to One Punch Man is this rock n roll sound of epicness as it paves way to the beat downs that Saitama unleashes on his foes. As the ending outro is this calm and relaxing sound that makes you feel at ease as in a good job well done Saitama for your Heroics and Saving the day. I honestly do enjoy the sound, not as much as other shounen anime, but Compared to the generic scores within certain other anime. 
Character Development: Sadly this is where the show fails and That is cause it is a comedy anime. The main characters lack any sort of development and That is cause he is already this powerhouse of a threat while the side characters have much to develop on. Saitamas only problem in development is that he lacks brains and That can be obviously seen within the episodes of the anime. Overall you can't fault One Punch Man for lacking proper character development as it is just a comedy, nothing more, nothing less. 
Personal Enjoyment: At first I disliked the anime cause overall the hype built on it was ridiculous. Hypebeast ruin anime to a certain degree and That should be obvious. I will say after seeing it a second time I started to see it's main point on the show and Started to like the show. It was funny, It was full of non-stop action, and The animation was top tier. Overall I did hate the lack of character development and A proper story, but What can you do? It's literally a comedy anime!
Overall: After talking about my point and Giving out my critique I must say the show was above average and I did enjoy it for the comedy gold that it was and The beautiful animation made the show that much better. Sadly the story was boring and The character development was half way empty, so to say. Main character development is boring, but The side characters are quite interesting.
My rating for One Punch Man will be 6 OUT OF 10 STARS! 
ONE PUNCH MAN IS ABOVE AVERAGE.

Comedy Gold

                I'm going to be honest. I thought I was going to get bored of Saitama beating the absolute crap out of everyone with just a single punch.
I didn't.
I watched this following Mob Psycho 100 and 100 II, so I had some pretty high expectations going in to watching it, seeing as how the source material for both was written by the same guy. Overall, I think the storytelling in Mob Psycho was superior, but One Punch Man made up for it with, in my opinion, a larger focus on humor and jokes. That's not to say there was no story or character development, but a
                  lot of the focus was put on making the viewer laugh. 
At the end of the day, I found One Punch Man to be a nice comedic break to sit down and binge for a day, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh.",9,Crabchip

One punch man is more like a comedy and less then a shounen. And feels like a low effort anime.
Story 1/10
Boy trains for hes whole life, and now he can even destroy a planet with 1 punch. He wants to join the hero organisation, to fight ''crime''
Art 9/10
The art is beautiful no complains here.Sound 7/10
Nothing to amazing, nothing to bad either.
Character 1/10
The characters are boring and mainstream. No effort at all.
Enjoyment 2/10
This anime feels like a low effort anime, make a guy who destroys everything in 1 punch, how does the typical episode go? Make a few jokes about the day, sees an enemy, makes a joke about how they look, destroys him in 1 punch, goes on about joking what happened that day. When I started watching this anime i was hoping for some epic fight scenes etc, that just did not happen. it mainly focuses around comedy and the shounen part is low effort imo.
Overall 4/10
If you like bad jokes, lame fights and no character development this anime is just for you!

                One punch man BROKES every single clitche that shounen animes has, and that is AMAZING.
Here you will not find a deep story with developed characters and tragical pass, etc. No, here you will laugh and enjoy, probably, the strongest character in all the anime. It is an anime that does not take itself serious, and that is perfectly engaged with the story that they tell us.
Epic battles, tons of laugh, incredible drawing, Charismatics characters, and adrenaline are the main ingredients of this awesome anime. And season 2 is confirmed so... What are you waiting for to watch this anime?

                To be honest, I didn't expect anything great or outstanding, knowing how popular and well-known this anime is, I always look down on such titles. It's not that I'm elitist, I just know from experience. 
But this anime made crave for more. OPM is extraordinary fun to watch, the jokes they make to mock common superheroes cliches, the protagonist - Saitama - from the very first scene I saw him fighting made me question: How they go with such overpowered character and still keep the show entertaining? And it was awesome how they pulled that all out. 
Sure, the story is mixed with many characters,
                  which kinda fill episodes, cause if Saitama always fought monsters before anyone, that would be lame to watch. But now that I think about it, this is a mockery on anime cliche - having tons of characters, when the main one is obvously superior to them. 
Fighting scenes are incredibly fast-pacing, well-animated, detailed and epic. This is the type of anime, in which battles always happen as natural disasters. Maybe this also was intented as a part of satire, but I personally love when such small characters can destroy mountains, skyscapers and earth crust with just a single fighting move. Maybe it's just me. 
Overall, OPM felt just like Guardians of Galaxy for me. It's funny, it's fresh, it's well shot, it's meant as satire, but it doesn't deny how engaging and amazing all the battles are. IMHO: must-watch.",9,robozaec

                One punch man has a special place in my heart as the true first anime i really watched. Of course, like anyone else, i saw pokemon and cardcapturor sakura and probably whatever else came on public television in the 2000s, as well as various miyazaki films. But does that really count? I'm not sure;  OPM marks the first time i saw people on the internet talk about an anime being good, saying ""hmmmm, maybe i should try it."", and then going onto a site and watching it. And man, did it change me. For months afterwards, i think i saw it in january 2016
                  and didn't watch another anime til like june, this was my one thing to fan over; I would tell everyone i knew that they needed to watch it, I'd rewatch it multiple times, i'd even listen to the fucking soundtrack. What can i say? First anime i really fanned over. 
I think what excited me was the action and the heroism and just how iconic everything was, all the heroes especially, they were like pokemon you could collect just by noticing them, every one unique and awesome in their own right. To this day i still maintain that the art and animation are some of the best I've seen, which honestly makes sense. The iconic shitty art of one himself mixed with probably the best manga artist in the business, murata, turned into an animation with some amazing fight scenes, of course it'd be good. 
The music is iconic, the brooding ""wet my scales"" tied to my favorite villain, deep sea king, the shitty, lame- then amazing and teary eyed ""justice rider"" for the coolest superhero ever created, mumen rider, the absolute PERFECTION of ""violent acts"", man, i instantly loved it. It's like everyone and everything has their own theme and it works beautifully. 
As i said before, the collection of heroes is one of the things that pulls you in, but i also think the characterization of some characters can be it's downfall. Almost every single hero gets developed to the point that you can see them running their own series - metal bat, stinger, the tank tops, etc. But, after reading the webcomic, and coming down from the euphoria of seeing something so flashy for the first time, i noticed some things that bother me now. To be honest, mainly Puri Puri Prisoner; an awesome character in his own right, even if you just watch the anime you have to admit his powers are some of the coolest, but, in the anime at least, his character is pretty much ""bad outdated gay stereotypes"". In the webcomic, he has this whole thing where everyone sees him as a joke and it leads to some self hatred, especially since he's at the botom of S-class, but he never stops fighting, because that's what a hero does. Zombie-man as well gets like 0 screentime, and anyone who's read the webcomic can tell you he's honestly one of the most badass heroes in the series, and essentially the protagonist of an entire arc. 
Maybe i'm judging it too hard, to be honest i skipped past the whole of everything that gets covered in the anime while reading the comic, but i'm pretty sure its a fairly faithful recreation, so maybe they just didn't have the time. Either way, the show is gonna get a lot better when they develop King (An absolute beauty), puri puri, superalloy, zombieman, etc. So i gotta give this one a 9 for now, in hopes that the later parts of the story can be a 10. Hopefully that's next season, but i never read the manga, which is an entirely different thing, so i guess we'll see. 
(If you're wondering why characters still gets a 9, the ones that do get development are awesome, which is honestly most of them.)",9,Mrmonkeymasta

                It’s easy to think that the premise of One Punch Man will get old fast. It clearly has for some. For me though, the One Punch premise took a back seat to all the other humorous elements at play. When that punch did show up, it felt like the perfect ending to top off the surreal experiences that had built up to the finale. You may be able to predict the outcome to any fight Saitama partakes in, but good luck predicting how he’ll end up there or what events will take place in the aftermath.
Saitama is a regular, (actually really below-average) kind of guy
                  who is a hero for fun. He has no passion for anything due to being terribly OP. The only thing he really seems to care about is saving money (although he would never get a regular job). Most animes are filled with characters who take themselves way too damn seriously. Saitama is the guy who outright cuts those characters off during their exhausting monologues, telling them to “summarize it in 20 words or less.” In this way, Saitama is often the stand-in character for the viewer. I honestly can’t think of a better role to have such an OP character play. No one else would be able to realistically maintain the level of detachedness required. 
Saitama’s reactions to events are *truly* artful and are a sizeable contribution to the humor of the show. This is due, in part, to the S-tier animation. This is one of those things that’s hard to describe—you have to see it. (I also refuse to spoil anything lol) The visual gags throughout this entire show were constantly surprising and never disappointing. 
The humor doesn’t just come from Saitama constantly wiping villains out in one punch. Yes, there is a lot of that, especially in the beginning. We increasingly get to see side-characters take on enemies who wipe the floor with their carcasses, until Saitama shows up and finishes them off in *spoiler alert* one punch. But it’s so much more than that. Contrast between Saitama, his environment, and everyone around him definitely also play a huge role. Genos, Saitama’s “apprentice” is a perfect foil who adds a lot to the humor. 
In the simplest terms, Genos is deathly serious whereas Saitama is never serious and probably *should not* be taken seriously unless you need something killed. Genos looks up to Saitama for his strength and as a result takes everything he says and does seriously. Meanwhile, Saitama has literally nothing to offer Genos in terms of advice or training (Genos is a cyborg, so training would be somewhat useless anyways). Genos is more of a fanboy than an apprentice, which adds to the humor considering Genos’ normally stoic composure. That said, Genos does a surprisingly good job at humanizing Saitama, as Saitama does show some level of attachment to him. He does seem to be somewhat concerned with helping him, but recognizes his own shortcomings and basically sees Genos as already being better than him. 
These kinds of traits help a lot in preventing Saitama from being unlikeable as a result of being OP. If he were egotistical, it would ruin the show. He’s actually probably the most humble character in the show, which ends up making him a lot *more* likeable than most. This obviously also adds a lot to the humor too. While side-characters are constantly bragging about how strong they are, there is the underlying awareness that their strength is nothing in comparison to that of Saitama. (It also makes it extra special when they inevitably get their asses handed to them in battle.) This in and of itself is an entertaining thought, given the kind of guy that he is outside of his overwhelming physical strength. It’s also worth noting that being OP on the battlefield doesn’t prevent Saitama from facing challenges in his regular life, which the show does a good job of exploring—all the while keeping it entertaining and lighthearted. 
There is no ~~serious~~ story. This is a parody of shonen after all: when the story is present, it’s there to make fun of itself. If you need characters and stories that are full of deep/serious drama in order to enjoy a show, even a comedy, you probably won’t like this. Most of the characters (read: everyone except Saitama) are extremely stereotypical. Everything that exists in this show is pretty much there to contribute to the comedy. There is a plot, but it’s definitely flimsy. I personally didn’t feel that these things held the show back very much, if at all, and I’m 100% normally the type to criticize poor plot and character development. The thing is, there still isn’t a useless moment present in this show. The pacing and storytelling are fantastic for what they are trying to achieve: humor. If this weren’t the case, maybe I would be more concerned. However, there really weren’t hardly any moments that made me cringe or left me wanting more in a bad way. This show almost never takes itself seriously, and the couple times it does contribute greatly to character development. I honestly think keeping it simple was the right move for this show considering the focus, and in the end we develop a pretty solid understanding of the world and the characters we’ve been shown thus far.
The animation is also S-tier, there’s not much to say about it that hasn’t already been said. I also found myself actually watching and enjoying the intro, which I pretty much never do.",9,titledefiant

                One Punch Man is a breath of fresh air in an era of mediocre comedy anime, but still has the time to include a great deal of action and excitement. But does it completely live up to the hype? That is what I am looking at today in a review of One Punch Man!
Story: 5/mediocre
The story of One Punch does not disappoint if you are easily impressed by small story arcs and not much intense suspense, but if you aren't one of those people, like myself, you will find One Punch Man sorely lacking in plot. The main point of the anime is to parody
                  super heroes who take themselves to seriously, and it completely smashes that goal. However, not much else happens. The storylines are basically gigantic fighting sequences and interactions strung together with tape. Many moments are filled with life and hilarious reactions. But rarely did I ever feel sorry or interested in any actions that caused emotion other than hilarity. Maybe in the second season, they will elaborate on the unknowns and questions that were unanswered in the first 12 episodes of this interesting show. 
Art: 8/very good
Much like Kill La Kill, Art is a category that One Punch Man submits the highest scores in. To the surprise of the viewer, One Punch combines the visual elements and stylings of the manga with hand-drawn qualities within the amazing animation and high octane seriously smooth computer-generated scenes that take up most of the show. It is truly an interesting and unseen spectacle that most have never experienced and many will attempt to imitate into the future.
Sound: 7/good
The opening of this anime perfectly represents exactly what the production is trying to imitate: impressive, expansive, and all-powerful anime fights and experiences. The song fits perfectly, only amping up the situation more and more until that one last high, shrill, stretching note that perfectly ends it. The best part is that the majority of the show is covered in majestic and magical anthems of rock and metal guitar riffs. The only problems is that most of them are forgettable, and are not much more than just score pieces, not separate songs in themselves like with Attack on Titan. However the mixing and initiative pop of the sound is great for the ears and mind to be involved in.
Character: 6/Fair
It is not that the character of the show is lacking, it is highly abundant in fact, but the shtick of each viable asset is lost and uninteresting within the first 6 episodes. Saitama is of course a man who can defeat any monster in one punch. That may sound interesting at first, but when his whole purpose as a character is not found or taken seriously, the laughs only go so far. Genos is interesting, with the Doctor as well as his origin story and past events. Comedic as it is the anime spends no time focusing on these at all, but along the way, I grew to like Genos more than Saitama. He was more fleshed-out (for being a cyborg) and had more emotion than Saitama (even though that is justified as well). By the end of the series, I was telling myself that it would have been more interesting to witness a Genos-centered series than this one. The Hero Association is basically a joke, with little time to care or even remember any of the other selection of heroes names (besides Sonic and Mumen Rider). It left me wanting more, but not of only this type of character action.
Enjoyment: 8/very good
One punch Man is an exciting and enjoyable thrill ride through one of the most action-oriented and masterful anime in the last decade. It will be regarded highly for it's sense of high-octane pace and deliverance in the face of an unchanging shonen scene. The fights were entertaining- for how long they lasted-  even though the villains may not be remembered. Without something like One Punch Man, we might not have an entertaining and comedic look at shonen that we needed. It surely will be a great ride for any anime fan waiting to laugh and start working out.",7,Chappie7815

                Oh, it's been 2 years? Wow how fast, just as fast as I finished watching this anime because of how hooked I was. OPM is what I would consider a parody to all those cliches of shonen animes, but as a parody, it becomes an instant classic that will be remembered for breaking with the main stereotypes of the anime and getting to exploit in an incredible way the capacity of animation and combat like never. This is one of those fantastic animes that leave me with the saliva from outside waiting for the second season to be able to have the joy and glory
                  of admiring such sequences of frames that leave me simply impacted thanks to the unparalleled photographic and cinematic quality, which means ? that just looks amazing and is incredible.",10,Endless_01
30276,"
                One Punch Man is an awesomely-produced show that does a great job of subverting shounen tropes. The main premise of Saitama having the ultimate power and his life being completely devoid of joy and challenge because of that is very unique, giving it the potential of being much more than just a plain parody. Many of its specific ideas, like contrasting the protagonist's straightforwardness with hero association's egotism and petty politics, are absolutely brilliant and deserve a lot more exploring (which I think was done in the manga and quite likely will be in the coming seasons of the anime). 
The problem is, the first
                  season relies on its main gimmick (Saitama being absurdly overpowered, while also so unassuming that no one treats him seriously) so much, that it leaves very little space for genuine suprise or suspense within the plot. After it established the main ""ruleset"" of its world in the first few episodes, it didn't manage to surprise me with anything or introduce any real tension. It doesn't make the show unenjoyable by any means, but is a far cry from what I could consider ""legendary"" series. It's too much of a One-Trick Pony and while the second season might remedy that, expanding on the setting and characters, and putting Saitama through some more complex situations, the first one really left a bit to be desired.
Of course, the animation, visual gimmicks, sound and voice-acting are all at excellent levels. The artstyle is a bit peculiar of course, but I like it a lot and enjoyed even its more ""extreme"" applications in Mob Psycho 100 and compared to that show, One Punch Man is fairly conservative. And don't get me wrong, I think OPM is great fun and something thoroughly worth checking out. It's simply ""only"" a very good anime, and not a legendary one many people make it out to be.",8,Plk_Lesiak
30276,"
                Re-watching the first season of One Punch Man, I am reminded of the two elements that endeared the show to me. How the show blends action with humor while sending up superhero/fighting shows and the titular character, himself. 
Of the first, One Punch Man confidently yet lovingly jibes at action oriented shows which climax with grossly overpowered characters settling scores and hitting plot points by means of city-devastating combat. It does this in spite of telegraphing the end of every major threat our hero faces. It is the ‘how’ as Shakespeare would say, lies the rub. So each episode a new kaiju with a ridiculously
                  over the top backstory emerges to terrorize the beleaguered inhabitants of cities A to Z and the multi-tiered heroes who stand to defend them. And in each episode of it’s excellent first season through the introduction of colorful supporting characters, scenery chewing monologuing, petty squabbling, laugh out loud gags, and occasionally genuine moments of heroism from the most unlikeliest of places, we get to the final confrontation where each seemingly unstoppable horror must square off against Saitama.
Which brings us to the second reason why I love this show. The character of Saitama and his attitude. Having achieved ‘God mode’ through his own training, Saitama is now a ‘hero for fun’ (later for profit) who could easily turn to racketeering and villainy or go out of his way seeking fortune and glory, but remains pretty content just doing his own thing and helping out where he can. Despite this, he has certain foibles, including jealousy, sensitivity about his um…scalp, and occasionally about not getting as much fan-mail as his roommate. However, when the chips are truly down, Saitama remains classy, eschews the limelight and fights to protect his friends and the greater good, rather than for his own selfish reasons. By the end of the first season, we like Genos his faithful apprentice, understand that there’s more to the world’s strongest hero than just his strength.
Finally, I am indebted with this show with making me fall back in love with the medium of anime. What Cowboy Bebop and Stand Alone Complex could not do, Saitama did. Hooked me back to this astonishing medium. 10/10. Masterpiece.",10,factorwonk

                edit: I have completed season 1 of One Punch Man. I would highly recommend this action-packed superhero satire. 
Story:
8-9/10
One Punch Man is an interesting show. It works well as both a comedy and an action-based series, and its simplicity is often its strength.
Saitama isn't an archetypal hero. He's bored with life and down on his luck, but he also possesses superhuman strength and speed. He's stuck in the middle of a real life kaiju movie, and he balances shopping for groceries and killing freakish aliens and monsters with his trademark attack, the titular one punch.
The story is unique in many ways. It's funny, but it
                  also has its moments of seriousness and introspection. Overall, the plot is more comedy-heavy, with an emphasis on the contrast between the absurd and mundane moments in Saitama's life.
Art: 10/10
Good action sequences. The art balances realism and absurdity quite well. The character designs are varied and interesting.
Sound: 10/10
Great sound effects, voice acting, and OST. The opening is catchy and memorable.
Character: 8/10
OPM's characters are humorous, but they have their quiet and serious moments as well, particularly Saitama as the reluctant hero searching for meaning and purpose.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Sure, it seems gimmicky at fist, but One Punch Man isn't just a one note show. It is fast-paced, funny, and entertaining enough to appeal to a wide range of viewers.
Overall: 9/10
One Punch Man (the manga and anime) is a brilliant franchise. It is a funny satire, a thrilling action/adventure, and an entertaining take on the genre that is reminiscent of the American superhero comedy The Tick in some ways.",9,MsChif

                Before I start this review, I warn you that there will be minor spoilers, and also that this review is a little bit biased, as I strongly disagree with it's overall rating that the community has given to it, but I'll try to be as objective as possible. Now let's get started.
Story: 6/10
Now, I admit that the story it's kinda original, but nothing that no one could imagine. It's about a guy who one-shots everything with a single punch (pretty obvious from the tittle), and about how he struggles to deal with problems that require more thinking than punching. Now, that sounds pretty cool, not
                  gonna lie, but I think almost anyone could have imagined something similar.
Art: 9/10
This is something I HAVE to congratulate Madhouse for. You know how in a lot of series there are these particular scenes which are extremly more fluent than how it's normally in this series? Yeah? Well, in OPM you'll find them EVERYWHERE. And the fact that they hired internet talents to experiment with the animation is just fantastic. This is probably the biggest pro to this series, in my opinion.
Sound: 8/10
The songs in this series are great, full of hype, fitting for the series and overall fantastic. I didn't found anything that is particularly outstanding, but it does it's job and it does it incredibly.
Characters: 4/10
This is, in my opinion, where the series starts to fall apart. I seriously don't feel any emotion awoken in me when I remember ANY of the characters. As an overall group, it's too simple, plain and without any emotion other than hype. Even in other series that are known for their amazing action scenes, like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, there is some incredibly good character development. In this particular series, the only ones who changed are Doctor Genus (which is a villain that appears in, I think ONE episode) and Genos, because he realizes that he must learn from Saitama to be stronger.
Enjoyment: 7/10
Even though I never yelled, cried or sat in the edge of my seat, I still enjoyed this series very much. I think everyone will find this series entretaining if nothing else. 
Overall: 6/10
In my opinion, this anime was nothing more than an action full series, that will be more enjoyable to the kind of people that don't like to think that much or get complicated stories. For me, I did enjoy it, but that's it. It didn't tought me anything, it didn't made me think. Overall, if you're in for good laughs and great fight scenes, I would totally recomend watching this, but for the kind of people who prefer darker, deeper or more complicated plots or groups of characters, I wouldn't judge if you just ignored this series.
And, last statement, in my opinion, this anime is not bad, but it's very overrated.",6,FukuroHane

                WARNING
This does contain spoilers on the character section, It is brisk but if you haven't watched one punch man at all or in the middle of it, I highly advise you ignore this review or just drop everything and watch it all now or finish up.
I think we all know what's it's like to start from nothing then eventually become something in the world.
Whether it be drawing, writing, cooking, music, etc.
Yet what some people tend to forget is you gotta either be incredibly good or incredibly lucky to make it big with what talent you may succeed in.
And in my eyes, one punch man is
                  a golden example to not only does it not matter if whether it be luck or pure talent but that people will see your work. 
But also that anyone small or talentless can at least offer something to the world, and that's something I'm willing to bet ONE knew and strode on and in the end, it all paid off.
Story: It's very good and rather simple to understand, most villains primarily are portrayed to best explain it via western perspective as a Saturday morning cartoon types of thing but if they weren't reoccurring excluding possibly one guy in the series but we'll get to him, the shows strongest suit of course is it's writing and thankfully it's been mainly untouched as far as I know.
The only downside of the series some may say is as the title states, it's about a guy who can defeat ANY opponent with a singular punch, whether it be normal or serious.
My only counter-argument to that statement is if your willing to watch discount humanoid sun wukong live on earth and fight off his own species, teenagers that can transform into weapons and fight witches, and an egotistical highschooler with a god complex with a magic book that can kill people in seconds, and muscular spirit wielders fighters hunting down a vampire whose life goal is to take over the world and end a bloodline, with his own spirit wielding fighters weakness is sunlight punches.
I think a guy that can kill anyone with one punch isn't much to complain about as to how absurd the concept is.
Art: Anyone that has come across ONE's self-published works of OPM can without a doubt say that the manga was a much-needed upgrade in the sense of it's still funny and good, but the art can use some work.
And just like Yusuke Murata's work on the reworking of the web series, studio madhouse manages to capture the reworked mangas spirit damn near to a T, thanks to it and the freelance animators (which at the time I didn't even know they brought in).
I have generally no complaints at all for how the show looks, from the animation to character designs, to the color/colours used, it's all pretty and generally appealing.
Sound: The Original Soundtrack is really great (you cannot look me in the eye and say that the Opening song can hype you up or make you sing along), since it has been a while I can't get too in-depth of sound but all I can say is that it is great.
[Final warning of spoilers below for OPM, again at this point if you still haven't seen it, leave now and watch it]
Characters: All of the characters do have a purpose in this series, but most of it centering around Saitama and Genos, the character I can empathize with is Saitama.
He busted and broken his body to be the strongest and to be a hero, but the cost of that was not having a challenge at all which makes it dull and lost that energy to have him go on, and now he wishes to fight an equal, someone who can stand against his attack instead of being a one-shot wonder and done.
He was close to finding one with Boros but ended him with one serious punch, but for the fact, that Saitama, or even us the audience sees someone is able to stand against even one of his attacks shows that that wish Saitama was hoping for can be plausible, but the main question is who, although fans can guess, speculate, and theorize.
In the end, the only person that knows who can be Saitama's equal is ONE and only time can tell as to who it is to rival Saitama.
My only gripe with some of the characters is just personal disliking (can't recall all the names and not gonna bother) or just one-shot villains that felt like lost potential which I get is the point as stated before 
Enjoyment: I just had a ball with this series and honestly loved every minute of this series, I can't exactly think of anything negative about it unless I get real nitpicky about it and be critical, but I can look over them and I already am taking up a good chunk of this review so let's wrap this up.
Overall: One Punch Man is anything shy of nearly a masterpiece for an anime adaptation and shows that any ordinary person can rise from small to big if given enough time and OPM truly shows.
this series is a without question 9/10 and my gold must watch stamp 
I strongly recommend this series to anyone who likes animation or just likes fun and enjoys good writing in general and looking for a good time.",9,Kanati01

                This is a great anime for those just starting out.  Here are some pros and cons.
Pros:
- Great humor (Often it was quite sarcastic/self-aware in its delivery, most likely unintentional.)
- Easy to follow storylines
- Astounding animation (especially during the action scenes)
- Interesting characters, and character development
- Incredibly fun and often lightheartedCons:
- Towards the end they throw in a bunch of new characters that can be a bit confusing.  Other than that, no real flaws that I can think of.
If you love superheroes but are still a bit tired of all the cliches and same-iness the American film market has to offer as far as superhero films, then One Punch Man should be immediately on your radar of things to see next.  It definitely feel very much like an MCU film mixed with shonen anime styles.  This series is an all around good time.  Super fun, and at times quite hilarious.  Definitely check it out if you haven't already.",9,OahuOtaku

                Ah, One Punch Man. I loved this anime from the first episode to the last one. Now, I haven't seen the second season yet (which I do plan on watching), but I can tell you one thing: if you want an easygoing, funny anime, this is a top pick from me.
The story is only there so that things make sense, but even so everything is very nonsensical - which in this case works in the anime's favor.
One Punch Man is an action-comedy packed series.The characters are interesting but not in any serious way, since everything is very easygoing. The action and animation shine, and most
                  of all the comedy does - through the action! Isn't that surprising?
My overall enjoyment of this series was a 9/10, with my only regret is not having it be longer. (going to watch the second season soon :] ) I recommend this wholeheartedly for anybody that likes anime - also a good title to get someone into anime through.",9,cryppycryp

                I won't write some overly dramatic long review. I will keep it short and simple. This anime is GOLD!!!! Augh! I need a moment. I'm not even big on superhero type anythings but I LOVED this!! It has a weird extra something that I can't really explain. Keeps you wanting more and more and more. And on top of that its hilarious, adrenaline pumping, warm, inspiring and there's epic ass-kicking going on. It completely and totally has the potential to be as long running as if not more than One Piece. It is up there!! 12 episodes were not enough. Not in the least. I
                  ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY RECOMMEND this.
Now,   GIVE ME SEASON 2!!! Come back minna-san. So freaking entertaining",8,hanamori7

My review doesn't follow the dumb MAL rating system. I just talk about what's good and bad
Grammatical errors are made (unless they're not then, ayyyy)Don't let this review sway you away from watching this show and vice versa
This review covers Seasons 1 and 2. Also the specials
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never have I watched so funny, but so fucking badass. I do love my action, but this had great animation, art and was hilarious. Not only that, but the characters are sick. Sure some are lackluster, but does it take anything away from the anime... yes, but it has other properties to make it amazing.
Now any anime can have one great thing to make the show good, but only the ones that are diverse and able to utilise the other it's other highs. They need a mix. The more the merrier. The show uses the great blend of comedy and action to help bring this anime to life. They're one of the most used genres, yet only a couple are great. Other than jujutsu kaisen, it tops my list of action anime and comedy. 
Though honestly what makes this anime amazing is Saitama, well for me anyway, he could be a bad character in your eyes so don't let me sway you into liking him. But the show is generally revolved around him, it's called ""One Punch Man"" for a reason. Every time something bad happened or when people were in trouble, all i could think was, ""when's HE going to show up"". 
Madhouse did an outstanding job with season 1. Shame they didn't do season 2. Season 1 was the best, which is why I gave it a 10. And while season 2 was a bit rough, it wasn't bad, still 7 worthy. And the specials were great too. In fact better than Season 2. Still Madhouse is back bitches, and they're looking great right now, so can't wait for Season 3.",10,itsChopSticks

                The sensation of the Fall 2015 season, One-Punch Man cemented itself as a prime example of the best anime has to offer in the 2010's, thanks to mind-blowingly awesome animation, an amazing soundtrack with consistent voice acting, and a simple yet effective plot boosted by lovable characters.
[Story - 7]
The basic plot to this show is admittedly rather bare bones - an average man named Saitama is a superhero with an enormous amount of power to the point of ending all fights in, well......one punch. He has to deal with the boredom of being too powerful for his enemies, along with going unrecognized in the larger
                  hero community. Along the way to gaining fame by joining an association of heroes at the behest of Genos, a noble young cyborg who becomes his self-proclaimed disciple, he meets many people (both good and bad) who seek to change his world in some way or another.
The whole show relies on these plot points to flesh out situations such as 'how would he fare against an undersea kingdom invasion?' and 'how does he have trouble making rent if he's so good at being a hero?' for the sake of parodying superhero + shōnen media. This is clearly shown with scenes of mass urban destruction and typical 'overflowing-with-energy' fight scenes, along with heaping amounts of slapstick comedy. Admittedly, this approach is rather hit-or-miss as it can kill the dramatic tension (especially towards the end) and can give the impression of poor pacing. It truly depends on whether or not the viewer would enjoy this sort of material (specifically, both parodies and God-Tier Fighting Shōnen). I, however, grew up on superhero comics and fancy myself a parody enthusiast so I felt right at home. The pacing is also adequate for a show of this scale and comedy: constantly grand but peppered with moments of reflection and slice-of-life.
[Art - 10]
Definitely the most universally acclaimed aspect of the show, and for solid reasons. As it was animated by Madhouse, it was to be expected that the quality would be great. However, it truly exceeds expectations; With a dazzling array of effects, a gorgeous palette of colours for everything/everyone, beautiful scenery + dramatic cinematography, unique character designs, and (of course) the beauty that is the variety of Saitama's expressions, I can honestly find no flaws here. The fight scenes come out rather beautifully, and the slice-of-life/discussion moments can either be dramatic, hilarious, or both all thanks to the amazing work put in here.
[Sound - 8]
The voice-acting for this show is solid: At the time of this writing I've only seen the Sub (but eventually plan to see the Dub), but I can definitely appreciate the quality of the work each seiyuu put in. They all fit their characters rather well, and special notice goes to the seiyuus for Genos and Saitama for being able to pull off both drama and comedy.
The soundtrack is rather stellar: With a mix of rock/metal themes and various typical-soundtrack/acoustic themes to accentuate the quieter moments, the soundtrack easily covers all bases required for the show. The OP is suitably epic, and never fails to get you excited for the episode. The ED seems rather unfitting at first (despite how nice it is), but quickly comes to symbolize the treasured privacy after a hard battle. While I haven't yet listened to the soundtrack in my spare time, I definitely plan to and recommend anyone who likes the genres mentioned before to check it out.
[Character - 9]
The show does eventually suffer under the weight of an extensive yet underdeveloped cast, but the characters it focuses on are truly worth discussing. Saitama, while lacking a strong arc of development, is always wonderful to see: he can adapt to any situation possible, and is rather nice for someone who can be treated rather poorly by those around him. He's the prime comedic actor of the show, being the protagonist, and excels at the job: With a mixture of remarks such as 'Was the bargain today?' and 'God, you talk too much' during high-velocity combat and his various dorky expressions, he cements himself as a memorable, if not deep, protagonist.
His 'disciple' Genos, however, is the one with the development arc. Initially an overkill-loner-type, he is soon shown how to be a hero by Saitama (in unexpected ways), and gradually learns a lot about the responsibilities he has. He can also be rather comedic, but in the sense of contrasting Saitama's laidback attitude with a rigid/by-the-book attitude. Other characters that, while not as fleshed-out, are worth mentioning are: Speed O' Sound Sonic, a mercenary-ninja who soon finds a worthy opponent in Saitama; Tornado, a master-level ESPer (not unlike Mob of ONE's other work Mob Psycho 100) with an ego to match; and Mumen Rider, a low-ranking hero with a heart of gold and an indomitable perseverance.
The issue of the extensive cast makes itself most apparent in the second half of the show (around episode 7): Its form is the many heroes of the Hero Association + the many villains that come along afterwards. While the issue was somewhat present with the first half's antagonists, it was not as blatant as it was here. They're all rather engaging with their basic traits, designs, and combat abilities, but more depth would be appreciated when the second season comes along.
[Enjoyment/Overall - 10/9]
While this show somewhat suffers from a simplistic plot and an extensive but underdeveloped cast, it was still a rather worthwhile watch due to the quality of comedy + action, gorgeous art, solid soundtrack, and fun characters. I'm not quite sure if I'd call this a favourite anime just yet, but I'm willing to wait and see if that will change. Definitely recommend giving it a shot if you're one for parodies of the 'overexagerration' type and love superheroes/epic-power-battle-shōnen.",9,comiclove

                Well this takes me back to humble beginnings. 16 years old, noticing that this genre called ""anime"" was highly popular and getting enough interest in it to want to jump on the trend. I had a look around what was popular at the time to find a show that would stick with me, and incidentally, the first show I found that hooked me was One Punch Man.
When you look at the premise for this show, it all looks rather simple and somewhat limiting: you get an underground superhero called Saitama who gave himself quite the stringent workout routine and as such has gained himself the
                  ability to obliterate any 300ft tall Lovecraftian monstrosity in a single punch and call it a day, and good thing too because these monsters seem to frequently flock around Japan like it's a sort of holy pilgrimage for them. It's like Pacific Rim but set in an alternate dimension, and without the mech suits because heroes exist.
But I digress, this premise does seem slightly underwhelming at first glance. ""Oh no, scary demon! Oh look, it's dead now. Next!"" But you could argue that this is a far more character driven comedy/satire on the Hero VS Villain with an ""overpowered character"" story. This is seen particularly when Saitama is trying to train a cyborg apprentice called Genos, or how there's a one registered hero without a single power but just rides around on his bike and has one of the biggest hearts in the show. And then of course there's the scene where Saitama struggles to defeat a measly, ordinary fly. I suggest this clan of demons, if there is a clan, take note of this.
So what you can expect are great characters, really well written comedy and plot lines, good pacing and great exploration of a character in a small series that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack!! I'd definitely suggest watching this if you haven't already, even as a starter anime. It was the first anime I watched all the way through and got me hooked right into the genre and really hyped for the second season... before the second season got delayed several years and other things took over my mind.",8,Speedster120

                This anime was THE HERO of my boring afternoons! Okay, sorry for the pun.
Story (8): I really like your first episode, it is very well directed and creative. The way they build up the main character and their first villain is spectacular. One being the one that has a simple and vulgar appearance, but which hides an enormous strength and the other, a terrifying monster that wants to exterminate humanity, but loses in Saitama's first attack. And this is repeated with each monster he encounters, he meets Genos who becomes his apprentice and ally in the fights and the rest is for you to discover,
                  in case you haven't seen the anime yet. One Punch Man as an action series with humor is perfect and its characters are great too, but if you expect a plot with lots of surprises and no clichés in this first season, I advise you to look for other more praised shonens/seinens.
Art (10) If you know Murata's manga and art, you know how One Punch Man is a paradise for readers. In my opinion, Madhouse made this anime practically the same as the original. Both very beautiful!
Sound (9): It's enough to miss you during the second season.
Character (10): The best King and Garou characters are still extras, but the highlights and even the villains are excellent.
Pleasure (10): What defines OPM are the fights and they are on the same level as Dragon Ball Z, Baki and other popular anime. Saitama vs Genos is an example, to this day I'm passionate about this and other fights that happened.
Overall (10): ""Someone who's a hero for fun.""",10,O_Anticults

                Man being a hero is tough, it's always hectic everyday, monsters rampaging the streets, but whenever i get over there, some hotshot hero already cleaned it up! Are they trying to kill me!? They pay me to do this job, and they keep stealing it, it's not even their area to begin with, god dammit, now i have to buy instant noodles again. YOU HEAR THAT VILLAINS! UP YOUR GAME OR I'M GONNA STARVE TO DEATH!
One punch man was really hyped during the season, I mean i wasn't really that hyped, i only bumped into the trailer and thought to myself, ""Hey this looks like
                  it's gonna be funny *add to list*"" I get why it was really hyped though, because one: It's a shounen. Everyone likes shounen, even people who doesn't like anime tends to watch shounen. Two: It's funny as hell, i mean look at Saitama's face, even the jokes are done well. Finally 3: The art style gives off a 'colorful' vibe that attracts younger generations to pick it up.
This show was exaggerated, not the show, i mean it was supposed to be satire, the statistics and most of the reviews are overrated. Sure, it's done its job to make more people watch anime, almost like the whole world knows one punch man, even the ones who hated anime, heck even my uncle watched it. They definitely didn't like it because of the story though, because the story isn't really that amazing, just Saitama want to find someone who can have a tough fight with, that's it, that's mainly it.
The song's a bit catchy, though only the ""HERO!"" part that's always stuck in my head, voice acting done great, and the background music fills the mood. Now the art style is what sets the flag ship on this show, the details and style made it seem like One punch man is in a superhero comic, and it actually is.
In my honest opinion, the show was too overhyped and overrated, but that doesn't mean it's not a fun show, the jokes were quite comical, the action scenes were straight up epic, and the ending was also satisfying.

                I liked this series. It stands out more than most of the shounen anime, and there are also slightly annoying fans, but believe me it is not as much as goku fans.
I mean, if someone told me that a cape-wearing bald throws everyone with one punch, I would never watch, who would watch? but I am glad that I watched it, I enjoyed it.
Let's look at the plot first. Someone named Saitama is getting so strong with unreasonable little work that he can beat everything with one punch. After that, he is heroic for fun and destroys threats in the world, but he never gets
                  the praise and fan club he deserves.
When I first watched the series I was young, but when I watched it again I found it quite funny unlike the first time. I must say that the characters and references are very funny and they are very well written. Its comedy combines Japanese comedy with American fantasies.
And even though the battles on the still moments bring quite the gas, it can sometimes bore you and surprise you. Sometimes it is annoying to see the enemy grow stronger by layers and the talent defeat him in one move.

                What's there not to like about this anime? Some will say that it's simple and predictable but that's the whole point. It's not a beat-em-up anime that drags on for 200+ episodes. 
I can sum it the premise of this anime for you as quickly as possible. The title is already a dead giveaway, he is the one punch man. Meaning Saitama can kill anyone in one punch.
Here we don't have a weak-ass protagonist that has to train year on end in order to get stronger to defeat his next opponent, No no no....here we have a protagonist who has already completed his ultimate training
                  of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, a 10KM jog and eats a banana everyday repetitively  for 3 years. So we've established that he's already reached maximum potential/max capped skills. Now all he has to do is walk up to people like a boss and punch them once and move on with life. 
He destroys his opponents so quickly you probably won't even remember them in the next 5 minutes, the way it should be.",8,Evol69

                After all these 'level up' mangas and animes, how do we make something novel?
Turn it on it's head and make the MC super over powered (OP). That's exactly how One Punch Man did it... and it's worked out pretty well so far.
But how?
When you have a super OP hero in terms of power level, how do you show him off?
you create interesting characters around him that carry the power leveling up progression of the narrative. You let the supporting characters give you a gauge on how strong the villain is and then... have the MC blow it out of the water; like comparing the swirl
                  of flushing the toilet to the milky way.
It's not that all progression is taken off the MC, he just has a different path. To be a hero you not only need power but also recognition. Having that be the main 'power progression' narrative of the anime is a refreshing take on super hero animes to which I personally enjoy. I can go all out on narcissistically identifying with the MC as he goes all out popping villains like balloons.",8,Archamity

                Its such a fun anime.
Saw the first two episodes and I felt nauseated. Those disgusting villains almost made me puke and I quit. After 3 years, had a sudden urge to watch it again. This time I made myself watch beyond 2 episodes. And thank God I did. Its so fun! Seriously, it is nothing but a fun anime to watch.
You know how almost every anime goes - there is a protagonist and he is trying to become stronger and stronger with the help of 'friendship' and 'love'. This anime is like, eff those, we will make the character God-like from the beginning. Saitama is
                  such an interesting and refreshing character.
Another thing I liked is Genos. His backstory is OKish but he is really really cool. The fight scenes in this anime is really good and those with Genos...muah!

                I keep my reviews short, simple, and to the point for those of you who don’t want to read the rest of these essays. If you like completely overpowered but underrated protagonists, this is for you. If you like fighting, this is also for you. This season is very well done. You can see a lot of effort was put into this, from the animation to the voice acting and even sounds effects. There’s hardly any real plot, we are just following the every day life of saitama as he works as a hero and completely destroys all the bad guys. The setting is nothing
                  special, but we get some interesting side characters. If you are looking for a real story or romance or things of that sort, then this anime is not for you. Don’t go into this expecting anything other than action and some thrown in comedy. I would say it’s well summarized to just say, watch this if you want to have some fun. The entertainment factor is about as high as it gets with this show, so just sit back, blow some time and enjoy.",8,ightxace

                While there are many things I could say about One Punch Man in relation to the themes, characters, production quality, and plot; ultimately, this show's one crowning achievement is its dry, persistent humor. This show answers the question that most shonen brings up but never answers: once you've become the most powerful hero ever, doesn't life get boring?
The art is in a classic style, and the plot rather like what you'd expect of a shonen-style anime. That is to say, there's not much that's remarkable about either. The drawing style is consistent with distinct lines and bold colors, which is pretty typical in an anime
                  of this genre. In terms of technical value, this anime is pretty average.
Yet it still ranks very high on my list because it has achieved a great level of entertainment factor. I really appreciate the characters. They're just the sort of quirky specimens one might expect to find in a show about a man who can defeat any monster with one punch. The villains are suitably obnoxious, but generally have laughable backstories. The heroes are likewise simplified, but in this caricature are profoundly understandable.

                This review contains spoilers.
Studio Madhouse went all out to animate this 12-episode bundle of joy, which drops like some atomic bomb that unleashes a fission reaction of over-the-top levels of OMG! Feast your eyes, naysayers, and buckle up as the Hero opening song will send your hype-meter soaring over 9000. 
The art was top-notch (considering when this anime came out). The music...?  Solid and damn sweet. Once you get used to the song, there's no going back. It's a rollercoaster ride from here onwards. Skipping the song would be sinful.
Now let's go to the premise and concept. Oh boy... This is where many love
                  or hate One-Punch Man (OPM), and haters seem to be missing out on something very critical. This is a gag anime, a parody of superheroes. It's a breath of much-needed fresh air in what has become an oxygen-starved world, where the oxygen is novelty. How many of us are jaded after watching superheroes face the same struggle? How many of us have thought ""Nah... Can't be asked to watch another DC or Marvel movie. It's always the same, more or less. Formulaic. Predictable.""? 
Well, let me surprise you. Here we have an anime with an overpowered protagonist, and by overpowered I really mean that he's beyond ridiculous, considering how he obtained his power. As the title suggests, Saitama (the protagonist) one-shots villains, and he makes it look like a walk in the park. Now you might be thinking that this is preposterous and dumb as hell. Why'd anyone want to watch an anime with some god-like hero, who will most likely always win and have no room for growth? He'll face no conflicts. He's just a lame Gary Stu. It's a given that he'll win, so there can be no suspense or tension. WRONG! 
Saitama is far from perfect. The dude is a bit socially awkward. Despite being massively overpowered, what makes him immensely likeable is that he *is* actually conflicted, and that he *is* not perfect. Just like us, he has problems that can't be solved with power alone. He's so jaded after always winning. You actually feel bad for the dude. You really pray that one day he'll find a worthy opponent to kick his ass, to lift him out of his existential crisis. When stronger villains come, you start wondering whether that villain could be the one. I feel for Saitama. When you are that good, is there any point to life? Is there any point in going on? Are you just killing time, perpetually stuck in boredom? This power might be a blessing for those who are being saved, but not for Saitama. This conflict is critical to the story.
Here are some other cool things:
***BIG SPOILER STARTS***
Hero moment:
When Saitama absolutely wrecks the Deep Sea King (a pretty powerful opponent this time) and puts that imbecile in his place, we learn something very interesting about Saitama. Some douchebag in the crowd that was saved tries to discredit Saitama's heroic act. In fact, that kid questions whether the opponent was strong at all, on the basis that a ""weakling"" like Saitama shouldn't have been able to win if the monster were actually truly strong. (I say weakling here because Saitama was unfairly awarded a C-Class rank, and the public and most heroes are oblivious to the fact that Saitama makes pretty much all S-Class heroes look like fodder.) All the other heroes failed before Saitama's arrival, so maybe they were just pathetic according to the kid, considering that a C-ranker like Saitama won. The kid says, ""In the end, the other 'heroes' didn't do anything."" And Saitama's response hits you harder than any of his punches: ""Today's my lucky day!"" he says, laughing. ""The other heroes wore the monster down, so beating it was kid's play!"" Soak that in for a moment. Saitama was offended that the other heroes were also being ridiculed, so he decided to give them credit at his own expense. The other heroes actually didn't even tire the Deep Sea King at all. Saitama could have demonstrated his power further (by lifting something heavy maybe), but no... He couldn't stand the fact that the beaten heroes were being ridiculed despite having put their lives at risk. Salute this man! He's a hero through and through, and a very fine one too.
Characters: 
When Genos (Saitama's apprentice/friend) arrives, we appreciate Saitama even more (as well as Saitama's character design). Genos looks flashy and badass, especially when compared to Saitama, who is bald and looks just like an egg in normal human clothes (when he's not wearing his awesome suit that is). The contrast between Genos and Saitama is staggering, and it creates a comical effect. A badass is being juxtaposed against a plain guy (but the plain guy is anything but ordinary, so don't judge). 
Anyway, Genos is an interesting character for a number of reasons: he is ambitious and knows about Saitama's real strengths, and he wants Saitama to get more recognition. I feel for Genos as well. He's trying to become as powerful as Saitama, but he questions the feasibility of what increasingly seems like a pipedream. So here we have Saitama who is jaded and conflicted because of his immense power, and we also have Genos who is in absolute awe of Saitama and feels inadequate until he can bridge the gap in power, an almost impossible task. Both  characters are conflicted for opposite reasons, and both enhance each other's designs.
There are other characters, such as King, who are also interesting, but I won't analyse these characters here.
Comedy:  
This anime is fuh-nnny in many ways! You have arrogant villains, who are toying with lives. Their arrogance and delight in inflicting pain is revolting. You really want Saitama to come and put these baboons in their rightful place (while also hoping that Saitama will eventually get stretched to his limit). It puts a smile on your face when a smug villain gets absolutely smoked, bodied... 
Also, it was hilarious when Saitama goes to take the hero exam. At the beginning, other applicants sneered at him, thinking that he was a deluded loser. BAHAHAHA! Saitama, now suddenly serious as hell, muscles flexed, face shadowed and ominous, destroys all physical records... (records that will probably never be broken). Dude jumps so high that his head gets stuck in the roof. BAHAHAH! After Saitama sets these insane records, the spectators who sneered at him return home (""Sheeeet. What's the point..."" sort of reaction). So much pure comedy. 
When Saitama opens his envelope to see what rank he received... LOL! He slowly pulls out the paper, thinking he got an S-Class rank (I mean it was a given... It's Saitama we're talking about). He smiles, oblivious to the fact that it was the letter C. When reality sinks in, you can't help but laugh... You also feel sorry for the dude (he was robbed).  
Also, Saitama sometimes has a hilarious facial expression: a troll face and a blank face... The art changes when he pulls these faces, and it is damn funny. Very hard to explain. I could go on, but there is a lot of comedy, apart from the obvious parody of the hero genre.
***BIG SPOILER ENDS***
In terms of story, there doesn't seem to be much of a plot at all. New villains come, some who are much more dangerous, and Saitama goes to do his thing.  The parody is the main theme.  We want to find out if Saitama will be able to find a worthy opponent, if he will be acknowledged by heroes and naysayers. 
You don't even need to watch the next season. This season is very short and refreshing (the concept is pretty damn novel: a parody of villains and heroes). 
Some might feel that it's too repetitive (rinse and repeat), that Saitama will just keep winning, but I don't think this is the main focus at all, as I have already explained. While certain aspects are repetitive, there is a level of depth that is not immediately obvious. You learn so much about the two main characters and their internal struggles. It's interesting that the strongest guy has a weakness inside. Will he find purpose and come to terms with life?
OPM knocked me out with the opening song, and I knew that this was going to be different from that moment onwards, that this was going to be class... Give this an anime a chance. You could be missing out on 12 episodes of unmitigated awesomeness.",9,Schwarznight

Yeah, yeah, the animation is really, really, REALLY good, but the history is nothing of another world. It's just a common fight shonen story, but with a character thats ridiculously powerful, yeah, that makes it better than generic shonen stories (Yeah, now I know that the anime is a seinen, lol) , but it's not enough. The secondary characters are plain as always, and the show is so desperate to make a joke about how Saitama doesn't phuk gaussian in this generic super hero world, that the characters will keep like that, like generic shonen characters. Genos could perfectly be the protagonist, and the show
                  will have nothing special. The only thing that makes it different from another shows, is Saitama. BUT, despite all, I must say that the designs of the character are very well done.
The comedy is good, just that, didn't fell of mi chair with any of the jokes.
Leaving the story and the characters apart, the show works very well like bombastic mindless action, and the animation just makes it better.
If you come to this series expecting a deep and complex history, you are very lost. Now, if you came, wanting to see espectacular action, a perfect animation, a seinen that looks like a shonen but it's not, and thats not so generic, you came to the right show.

                One punch man is light on story or character but it doesn't try to be that serious to begin with. The focus of this series is to have fun watching how ""the one punch man"" Saitama destroys his enemies with a single punch but still doesn't get any recognition by the other heroes. 
The real point of this anime is the fight scenes and mean damn.... They are madness, truly something to experience. The fight scene in episode 1 alone is better then most anime fight scene I have seen. 
Where the anime falters is towards the middle when the episodes start to feel a
                  little unnecessary and dry. But the last few episodes pick up the pace and the anime ends on top. Overall the anime isn't meant to be deep or serious, just pure fun and it mostly succeeds in that. It is far better then season 2 though, I'll tell you that.",7,TheNightmare265

                I think the main points of strength of this series are two : the idea behind the main character and the creativity in the design of monsters and heroes
Usually in action-based anime the main character evolves through difficulties and struggles, becoming stronger while the story unfolds, eventually (often) the strongest. This is the complete opposite : an average, ordinary man is already the strongest man on the earth, probably in the universe, but no one knows.
Apparently insignificant, he keeps fighting the misterious creatures, unseen, protecting the world just for hobby. Also, Saitama is affected by a form of depression (I think that kind of apathy-oriented
                  depression) because he doesn't find challenging opponents, which causes him a deep boredom.
So original and well written character. Most of the others are nothing special, except  few ones.
This is more or less the premise of the story, which developes in a linear but catchy way, with him gaining more notoriety, while facing his unpopularity.
I haven't seen particular messages or philosophy in the story, except the theme of determination that leads to improvemnt, and the loneliness of the first one. Still amazingly entertaining, with lots of action seeing a wide variety of monsters and heroes, all with their particular powers, some cool, some bizarre, some a bit cringy, but always a display of fantasy and creativity from the author. I also liked the idea of an insistution of heroes.
Definitely an anime that is worth watching to have a good time.",8,Thrasher96

                One of the things I love about anime as a media is how studios are not afraid to deconstruct the genres that have built up their popularity for so long. A show is called a deconstruction when it takes common tropes that exist within the anime genre and changes the perspective of it into a whole new kind of show. In the case of One Punch Man, the show tackles different pieces that build the superhero/shounen genre in a comedic way making us look at the whole genre from a different perspective. 
If we look at Marvel’s cinematic universe, every character has a backstory, a
                  drive and a development of character to make them the hero they are today. For the example of Iron Man, Tony Stark starts as the egotistic weapons juggernaut that only cares about the company’s bottom line. After character development caused by his own weapons being used against him, he becomes the iron man that cares about protecting the world.
One Punch Man’s Saitama is a character that wedges himself in this super-powered world. His existence attempts to take all the seriousness from the world for comedic effect. If a character tells a backstory or gives a monologue focusing on their intentions, simply Saitama’s generic and bald looking caricature nullifies all potential emotion or feeling the audience is supposed to feel. I mean, that’s the whole point of the show right? To make us laugh? 
However it comes at a cost that One Punch Man failed to realize. Shifting to another funny and slightly deconstructive show, Konosuba humors the Isekai genre of anime with how pathetically hilarious the main cast is. It always seems like the show NEVER takes itself seriously at any point. It does not give us any hope for a serious plot to ever exist within the show and it still manages to entertain the audience. One Punch Man builds on everything surrounding Saitama. The characters, the world and the epicness of the animation continue to grow outside of the funny looking idea and into something the audience kind of wants to take seriously. 
At first Genos looked so one dimensional with his comical backstory and how inferior he was to Saitama. But as the show goes on, you start to root for him. In fact, you start to be interested in everyone. By giving all the characters a leg to stand on, Saitama starts to become annoying. A character that ruins any potential hope that One Punch Man could bring to a serious plot. At first I was able to turn my brain off and enjoy how silly the world was in the way they wanted, but as the stakes got higher and the characters and animation elevated to these levels of epicness I couldn’t. That’s why this show suffers from balance, I feel the intention of comedy but with the delivery of epicness that I can’t ignore. The fight with the Deep Sea King is a huge example. The character development surrounding the supporting casts’ courage and togetherness actually felt real and had a serious tone I was rooting for. But to end with Saitama’s single punch to end it all with no animation and a freeze frame with nothing to build up for, didn’t feel funny but instead felt like a slap to my face.
The Deep Sea King fight transitions into a positive point I have for OPM’s deconstruction. Saitama being the strongest human being on the whole planet, never receives the recognition he deserves for any of his actions. This plays on the dystopian idea of a constructed hero world. Status and ranking is all everyone cares about while true justice and heroism takes the backburner. This can relate to BNH’s Stain and villainous motivations as he believes that he has a sense of duty to cleanse society of false heroes. Saitama really doesn’t care though, his motivations are rather simple. “I’m doing this for fun”. It shows in how he sacrifices the potential benefits of his heroism to commend the other heroes that were involved in the fight. I mean, it’s a cool gesture and it kind of knots the whole plot together at the end of each tiny arc but I had a hard time caring for these gestures. They felt so generic and insincere.
In fact the most sincerity I felt was from my favourite character Mumen Rider. He parallels Deku from BNH and his definition of making a difference as a hero. Both originally having no powers, they still carry this strong sense of justice to save others in need. It’s these legs that the plot stands on that completely counteract the comedic effect of the show.
Animation is also a big carry for the show. Without the detailed and hard work Madhouse took to build on the intensity before the punch, this show would just be average or even below average. The way Genos’ abilities were showcased in every fight scene he was the only one that appealed to me in the entire show. Animation carries art style too. The art style of OPM was too bland to even remember what most of the villains and side characters looked like (however that may have been the point to begin with). But watching them freely move with entire cities as their playground was too entertaining to not pay attention to. 
One Punch Man has always been this controversial score to me, because I always feel like the hype carried its score way too high than it was supposed to be. I like OPM, but not to the extent that many have put on its pedestal. After rewatching the show and reconfirming my original beliefs, I see some of the original appeals and have laughed at some of the jokes but am still drawn to its setting and plot behind Saitama’s massive comedic shadow that blocks the potential of the show.",7,Kafius

                I was looking foward to review this anime for a long, long time, it, everything on it is very special to me, since the opening that makes you feel strong, to the ending, that gives you that feeling that you're not alone in this world.
I can't deny that this anime made me very happy, making the sadness go away, making me go through this pandemic with a big smile on my face.  
It was like watching it like the first time, that same feeling, that same laugh, that same chills at the Mumen Rider scene. Even being an C class Hero, he has an
                  big S in my heart. 
No doubt Saitama is a big inspiration to all of us...
Story - 10/10
Wow, how can I even start describing how amazing this anime is? The opening: gives you that feeling to be strong, to keep walking, looking foward, to believe... The ending: Gives you that feeling that everything is goind to be all right, that your day can be very extressing, but there will be that person you love at home, waiting for you
The way Saitama dosen't care about money, he just wants to help and protect his people, the way Sonic put determination in his fights... Only wanted that they put more effort on 
Tatsumaki parts on the anime, it felt off.
Art - 10/10
It's simple amazing, the effort they put on every effect, every explosion, every fight. I really love that moments when Saitama makes that derp face.
Character - 10/10
I simply love all the characters, Saitama, Genos, Sonic, but my favorites so far are Tatsumaki and Puri-Puri Prisoner ♥
Tatsumaki - Well, she's just bad-ass, she dosen't need anyone telling her to do stuff, she just go for it, the way she deals with the enemies at the end of the anime is just amazing, really amazing, love her so much ♥
Puri-Puri Prisoner - DO I EVEN NEED TO SAY ANYTHING? He's just trully FABULOUS! The first time I looked at him I just couldn't control myself, the way he talks, the way he fights, and that transformation, such style, such glamour, he's gorgeous
Let's talk about Saitama? He's like the best hero, that's it!
Enjoyment - 10/10 
Since I'm in pandemic, I really needed to watch this anime again, to make me feel happy and strong again, I watched in two days, an episoded ended, I was beggining another one, I'm really happy that I visited the city of Saitama again. Watching him save the world, looking at that derp face of his, looking at the powerful Tatsumaki, looking at the fabulous Puri-puri, an amazing anime, for sure!
Overall - 10/10 
Yes, everything deserves 10, EVERYTHING!
This anime helped me a lot, makes me wanna be strong and help everyone, protect the ones I love, always wanting to be better and better in every way ,. Wanting to be happy, continuing smiling, donsen't caring about what other people think.
Thanks, Saitama for making me believe that I can be brave and strong.
Thanks Genos for making me stay determined.
Thanks Sonic for making me believe in myself.
Thanks Tatsumaki for making me want to be tough.
Thanks Puri-puri Prisoner for making me want to be who I am.
Thanks Mumen Rider for making me know that everyone can be a hero.
And of course, thanks ONE for making one of the best stories ever!",10,riccardozaniboni

                One Punch Man is one of the biggest anime titles to come out recently, when it started airing it soared to the top of IMDB, and it garnered the attention of people who hadn't even ever heard of anime, and that's pretty impressive. So was the hype right? Is it really that great? Well, kind of.  I actually understand the massive hype for once, especially more than some other shows hyped before and after it. Almost everything else from 2015 was pretty disappointing, so the thought of a satire of overpowered protagonists looked like a breath of fresh air. I have to admit, I
                  was very excited for One Punch Man. Maybe not to the degree some people were, but I was definitely looking forward to seeing how it turned out. Unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me. I wanted so badly to like this show, but I simply just could't get very much enjoyment out of it. 
The Presentation (Art and Sound)
One thing that this series got right was the animation. All I can say is HOLY SHIT it is awesome! The animation is done by MadHouse, so it's automatically going to be at least good looking, but they really out did themselves here. All of the animation is fluid with incredible fights and detailed and interesting character designs. Despite the setting being fairly bland great detail is still put into the backgrounds, and overall the animation is really some of the best I've ever seen. It just goes to show that budget isn't everything, as the anime only had a moderate budget. As for music, it was also amazing. All of the songs are exciting and fit perfectly with the mood of the series. And yes the opening is absolutely incredible. So yeah the presentation was amazing, but what about the rest?
The Characters
One Punch Man is episodic, which I don't have a problem with, however lack of a story means that they have to be carried by their characters. So how does One Punch Man do in this area? Not great. I don't have much to say about the characters because they don't standout much. They are all satires of shounen archetypes, and are done fairly well, but none of them really stand out, and would be totally forgettable if it wasn't for their great character designs. None of the characters outside of Saitama and Mumen Rider get good development or any focus over the series, and we're never given any reason in particular to care about them. We basically just get to know how over powered they are. Saitama was an interesting character, but he was more interesting for the role he played in the story rather than for a standout personality. This puts a massive damper on a series, especially for an episodic where the story is automatically going to be weak. 
The Story
This is where OPM really hits a low point. It's an episodic comedy, which kind of already put a damper on the story already, but if done right it can be pretty good, (Golden Boy, Nichijou, Cromartie) but this is not one of those cases. The story revolves around Saitama, a hero who can beat anything in one punch. He beats the most powerful and prideful of enemies so easily that he gets bored of being to strong. It repeats a pattern over and over again: an impossibly strong enemy shows up, they throw everything they have at it, then Saitama shows up and beats it in one punch. Sounds great, and it is, the first 10 times. It repeats the joke until it loses all comedic effect. While yes, him beating everything in one punch isn't the only joke, it is the main one and it is way over done. Sometimes they use the events to try to give Saitama development but they don't spend enough time on these moments for them to have an impact to the overall story. A lot of the jokes out side of the main one hit fairly well, but they are mostly about how overpowered the characters are. The first and last episodes were definitely the best of the series, with the jokes not feeling recitative until about episode 3, and the last 3 episodes have some of the coolest, well directed fight scenes from recent anime, and they kick the show up to 11. But unfortunately the middle of the series exists, dragging it out and draining my enjoyment of the show a huge amount. This was overall the most disappointing part of the series.
Value and Enjoyment
I do value One Punch Man very highly. I would much rather things that at least try to be original and creative get popular then the majority of anime now a days, but the hype really hurt my value of the show. When it was airing you couldn't say anything remotely negative about it on social media or you'd get down-voted into oblivion. It got a ton of praise for a simply above-average show and it certainly didn't ""save anime"" as everyone was  saying. However, thankfully that kind of hype didn't last. It's still very popular, but now you can actually criticize it and not get attacked. The show didn't have as much going for it as everybody thought it did and failed on the  re-watch value because once you've seen one episode you've basically seen all of them. I should probably give it another chance now that the hype is dead, and it's always nice to just sit back and enjoy some nice animation. I'm happy that this series was made, as it might help more out-there, obscure web-comics and manga get adapted, with Mob Psycho being a recent (and more entertaining) Example.
As for enjoyment it's as I said before I wanted so badly to love this show but I just couldn't. And this show had so much potential! I've said before I'm a big fan of self aware series and I would absolutely love a show like this, but it doesn't go anywhere. I have been told that it eventually gets better, so I am very enticed to read the manga, but the show as it is never escalates. It's all the same thing, the same joke, the same punch. There's no feeling of progression and overall I was very bored by it. I would have put this show on the same level as No Game No Life, but it is really not as good because in NGNL they faced every new challenge in a unique and interesting way. Who cares if they win every time it's entertaining as fuck! It's more about the way they win rather than if they're going to win. I do have to put in another mention of the last few episodes, because overall they were very solid and the most fun I had with the series. I think if it had gotten to that point earlier in the series or the series wasn't as long it would have been a lot better.
Overall, One Punch Man is a waste of potential, but not a disaster. It got some unwarranted hate but there's so much hype that it really cancels that out. Plus I myself also don't think it's very good. It's overall above average and gets stale quickly. Not to say it's not worth watching, the animation alone makes it at least worth one go through, but if you are going to watch it keep your expectations low. If it does get a season 2 (which it probably won't because of how MadHouse is) I will definitely watch it. Who knows? Maybe this is just the tip of the iceberg, and the story gets amazing. 
In the end I give One Punch Man a 6/10, mediocre, but great in concept and animation.",6,Gay_Frog

                Quick, easy to read reviews from an anime fan that hates anime.
Story - It isn't very in-depth, but that isn't the point of this anime. Everything about the story is one big anime trope. It just constantly makes fun of stuff you see in typical Shounen action anime. The overall point is that the hero can kill anyone with a single hit and it makes him depressed because life is boring. He joins a professional league of superheroes in hopes of going up in the ranks to make life more interesting. Imagine if the Justice League or The Avengers had thousands of members who got
                  paychecks like any regular worker.
Art - Looks great, especially during fight scenes. Regularly gets that hand-drawn scratchy look when things are moving really fast. Did I mention the action scenes look amazing? Very flashy, very fast, very over-the-top.
Sound - Sounds like an anime. Amazing atmosphere for what's happening.
Character - I really like all the characters. The ones that are obvious jokes do a great job at being funny. The ones that are supposed to be cool are cool as shit.
Enjoyment - For me, I was laughing a lot during regular scenes, and excited during fight scenes, even though I knew what was going to happen. Anime NEVER makes me laugh. Anime creators are idiots when it comes to comedy. One Punch Man is genuinely funny to me.
Overall - It's awesome. Watch it, yo.",9,Reposiric

                Well, I give this show a try bc a close friend tell me it was really good and, let me tell you this: It isn't a bad anime but is the least appealing story I've ever watch. I don't get the ""I'm really really OP and i'm finding someone that could survive one hit"". The OP part doesn't bother that much but the bland attitude of MC kills the show for me.
This is a show very focused on action, one of the reason i don't like it, and that lowers a lot my rates. The few character i see before I dropped it (not taking
                  into account Saitama) wasn't that bad and the art and sound was good.

                ok, classifying One Punch is strange, since its story is mediocre and its characters are meh, but its animation and sound is glorious, its story is so basic and repetitive, but even so it changes and manages to make you see the whole series , the episodes and the time is something exact, 12 simple episodes, the correct thing, avoiding the overexplosion of the series, the characters, some are empty (most of them) but there are some that are really well written, like Genos, it is an anime that It is super entertaining and you can see it in 1 day or 2, it is

                So this is the kind of anime that could either be our favourite or just another try hard anime that has no flavour at all. It's impossible to choose beyond that, they said. So what better thing to do than to break some rules judge in a way everyone can enjoy. like a win - win scenario.
So the story goes to tell us about a bald dude named Saitama who can literally split his his enemies's asses in half with a single punch , thus gave birth to the name ""one punch man"". He decided to be a hero for fun after saving a ""ball-chinned""
                  kid who happens to be the manager of the err..hero corporation? basically the boss or something like that. he acquire this God tier power by following a fairly simple routine which any bodybuilder high on steroids can attain easily.
100 PUSH UPS!  100 SIT UPS! and 100 SQUATS! then a 10 KM RUN! DO IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!
yeah, like we don't school.
the fights are epic but it feels kinda bland sometimes since Saitama cant whoop anyone with just a punch, leaving the fight short and unfinished in a sense. But hey look on the bright side we have Genos to literally write down whatever he has to say right? 
The only long fight i can remmeber is the fight with Boros the Ruler of the 
universe..or galaxy.

I havent watched many anime's, and the ones i have watched are all very mainstream, but this show stood out to me. Majority of shonen's follow the same patter of a weak character who thn becomes strong. One Punch Man is different. he is already strong and it shows that being powerful and great all the time isn't too fun if there inst any challenge.
I enjoy the fact that almost every episode there is a massive fight. This is great for my enjoyment and allows me to stay interested. 
The amount of characters and there own different moves/abilitys is great. 
The artwork is also great
                  and i love how each character is so different to one another.

                THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR SEASON ONE!
For what it does, it does well. Alike many other shounen animes, it certainly is formulaic. Every episode consists of a new boss and thus, a new fight scene. And while many face redundancy and boredom when every episode is set up the same, this did not. It was refreshing and entertaining, to say the least. Which, in many ways was due to the protagonist - Saitama. He was the perfect combination of being light-hearted while also taking things seriously. 
I tend to have a hard time when protagonists are so strong that then everything is too easy. But
                  this show actually used that as a problem and not a solution, which I truly loved! They depicted that Saitama did not enjoy such easy battles, and rather, it frustrated him horribly - thus being his personal conflict the entire season. This was a super unique perspective to take!
What kept me from giving this a higher score is just a lack of plot. We don't know anything really about any of the characters by the end of this season, there has been no character development, and there is no over-arching enemy. It would be nice to see perhaps one villain fleshed out and provided with some real and honest malicious intentions that take up half, if not an entire season. 
I know season 2 is out and more, so I look forward to seeing what comes next! 
That said, I do recommend!",8,hbaby1093

                A very popular show. I think it's worth the hype. I like the dead-pan humour, the interesting universe and the visuals. A pretty badass intermediate guitar lick as well during ""ad breaks"". One Punch Man's ""sidekick"" is a pretty cool dude and I like his character. The whole ""apprentice"" gag is pretty funny. I was pretty invested in Saitama levelling up as a hero for some reason, it was done well. The final part of the show was excellent too.
The art-style is fairly simple super-hero sort of stuff. but it works well. Saitama himself seems boring at first but his character has interesting reactions to
                  the events around him, even if they are just dead-pan jokes (not that he is joking himself but the way he is expressing things is meant to be funny to us). I think what helps advocate for the iconic nature of the show is seeing Tatsumaki everywhere now even if she doesn't actually have much of a role in the show. Little side characters have a lot of depth is what I'm saying, even the villains. I like the one that chose to go straight-edge and get an office job lol.
It's very popular and very good in my opinion. Seeing Saitama as a profile picture everywhere makes sense now. It's a 9/10.",9,mr07

                Madhouse's 1st and Only Season of ""One Punch Man"" is genuinely one of the best shows to come out of the 2010s decade for Anime. Up there with Tatami Galaxy, it is hilarious from start to finish.
Taking the Shonen/Superhero Genre and flipping its tropes on their head. Showing them for how unmotivating, meaningless, and ultimately nihlistic their message ends up being.
While most shonen/superhero stories or power-fantasies, of the like - try to awe the viewer by giving them a sense of hope, One Punch Man shows you how that thirst for Power has absolutely NOTHING to do with anything that could be considered positive or
                  optimistic. Instead it makes things downright depressing. The Lack of Competition or Threat makes obstacles seem like a chore and therefore makes Life uninteresting and deprives people from taking meaningful challenges. The truth about Power-Fantasies is that it makes people too comfortable in their own little bubbles. Vapid Escapism doesn't really offer motivation for solving real life issues, they become a distraction.
Since, Saitama can defeat any enemy that comes in his way with minimal effort, there is nothing left to do for him but engage in vapid escapism, indulge in consumerism and live a meaningless existence. Without challenge there is no growth and without growth, there can only be stagnation. And Saitama's biggest challenge becomes instead to break that stagnating cycle, but alas, he is unable to lose.
In terms of the characters, aside from Saitama, every side-character has some typical generic backstory that is put in contrast with Saitama having no backstory - getting his powers from doing 100 sit-ups, push-ups and a kilometer run. Genos being the biggest example of a Character that has tacked on backstory with complicated motivations and a lot to learn and grow, which puts him directly in contrast with Saitama for the vast majority of the show.
The ONLY other Character that doesn't have a tacked-on generic backstory that sticks out despite having little screen time is Mumen Rider. A comparatively weak hero with a heart of gold and the dedication of a Saint. Ironically the truly inspirational character in the entire show is the weakest character who barely accomplishes anything. This is runs perfectly with the themes of the Show. As power doesn't bring meaning, rather dedication does.
One Punch Man is a truly unique series from the 2010s Era. While most shows from this decade can't help but fall into tropes, cliches, or become parodies of themselves, One Punch Man succeeds by reversing the meaning of struggle in key structural ways that makes it an Intelligent Subversive Comedy.",9,Kryptonot_7471

                After watching One Punch Man, it's easy to get an idea of ​​why we talk about one of the most popular anime of the moment and how he has achieved a legion of fans as big as him. We are facing a very, very funny series that also has very exciting moments. The two main protagonists, Saitama and Genos, have a special charisma that will make us want to continue running adventures with them. In addition to all this, it has a technical section of honor registration. This title gives a little twist to what accustomed to superhero stories, providing a very refreshing touch.

                What a great experience. It knows when to be serious and when to give you a laugh. The humor is on point, the characters are well put together, Saitama is as badass as he is funny and relatable, the music is amazing, and the animation is some of the best I've seen. The VA performances are top notch, the buildup from episode to episode of gradually fighting more outlandish opponents is great.
I put it off for years because I really believed there was no way the elevator pitch could work for me. I always heard it referred to as ""imagine a guy can kill anything
                  in one punch, yeah that's OPM"". The series is so much more than that. Saitama's strength is more of a small recurring joke rather than the main point of the series. What it actually ends up being is a frustrated hero looking for purpose and finding it in ways he wouldn't have imagined. One of the best shows I've ever seen and I can't recommend it highly enough.",9,tomankage

                This is an anime that I really enjoy watching. After getting the DVD of the full season back in December of 2020, I began watching One Punch Man, not knowing what to expect despite seeing a few small clips of it beforehand. And oh. my. god. This anime goes off-the-wall with their artstyle, it is truly amazing. Overall, the characters were kind of boring, but to be honest, being a bored character helps fit their personality, as Saitama is bored of just defeating villains with a punch. The dub itself was pretty good too.

                This is an anime that I watch over and over again. I love the concept of a hero who has such an anticlimactic way of finishing every fight. It's always so funny to me. Some people think the fights are kinda disappointing but i think they're perfect. It's a shounen anime where the main character can't fight because he's too strong! Every villain is hyped up and every time I wonder 'will this be the guy who finally can handle Saitama's punch' and they never are. It's always fun to watch him just stalk up to someone and one punch kill them. 
I could sit
                  all day and talk about how much I love Saitama. He's so nonchalant and confused all the time. He's the world's strongest hero and no one appreciates him for it but he doesn't care. He just does it as a hobby! He's a perfect main character for this super powered world.
Other characters are amazing too. I love Genos. He wants to follow Saitama so much. I love Sonic. He's silly and fun. The world slowly unfolding as the season progresses and I can't wait to see what happens next!",9,OtakuInku

                Story
The Story is the ""weakest"" part of One Punch Man. The setting is very simple and is barely enough to just produce more and more evil beings, which endanger humans or even humanity. That is good in some way, so they have their freedom for their silly funny ways and explaining. The most interesting part for me was the development of Saitama and Genos and their goals. It also was a good decision to give Saitama the role of an underdog. That gave the anime the most exciting part, at least for me.
Art
Very good. Fights are looking epic, expressions can be serious and funny (yep,
                  I talk about you, Saitama!). Very enjoyable, and it did it's part to make the anime even better.
Sound
It hits my personal liking. And it fits the situations very well. I always liked to here Genos parts or when Saitama gets serious. For me, it was a very catchy tune.
Character
No one gets spared. Even the darkest and most serious characters have at least one funny little moment. And it doesn't break their concept. It's at most an acceptable slip. The important ones don't seem common. Yes, the evil ones are very flat with their ""reasons"", but often it makes up the funny part. It's more like an excuse than a reason to get beaten up, but that's more than fine for me. And I like how many of those ""serious"" characters have their surprisingly funny background.
Enjoyment
I enjoyed the anime so much. It doesn't take itself serious at all and still fits. Saitama is one of the most OP characters in the world of anime (no surprise he gets compared even with Goku) and it is more than okay, because the anime is nonetheless able to set up new expectations in new situations to let them feel serious and dangerous. And they do invest a lot of time for that! The funny surprises caught me and I love them. Last but not least there are tons of funny references. The question is, how can it go even further after the end of season one, but that part is for season two!

                Wow. What a punch to the face from a show like this. And ti was the exact punch I needed to get on my bike and make a difference in this world. It cured my depression to an acceptable degree and pushed me out of bed to take a light stroll - not a 10km jog yet but I'm getting there.
It's a show that delivers action when you need to just zone out of your everyday life, and if you had watch anime before on the fly you might find this one quite the comedy and it sort of picks fun at such tropes and
                  genres in anime as a whole.

I'm probably one of those who had watched this series a bit late. I really enjoyed this series.
The opening is great, visuals range from simplistic to detailed, sound seems apt. Suffers a bit on action and fighting sequences but that is the point, and for some reason, I didn't grow tired of watching Saitama overpowering his opponents -- I'm either laughing maniacally or getting overwhelmed by rule of cool. I guess watching the whole series in one sitting kind of helps?

                A HUUUGE mistake many have made when criticizing One Punch Man is the fact that they constantly forget that this is a COMEDY. 
Unlike most action-comedies, this is ALWAYS Comedy first, Action 2nd. 
This is what OPM IS. It's what MAKES it.
So when people say ""Oh they were unnecessarily comedic at this part or that part"", they're just being dumb in thinking this is your regular action-comedy instead of realizing it's a comedy-action lol
[Story] 8
OPM DOES has a linear story line that it follows of Saitama as he fights his way up the ranks [of the Hero Association, think of it like the ranks of
                  a Guild in Fairy Tail] with his cool ""lackey"" Genos.
The whole 1st season is all about slowly introducing who's the REAL enemy & who are the allies through fights with big villains. 
Beyond all of the tiny enemies are enemies whom you would think are allies.

I think it's pretty great. Pretty on par with Shounen actions.

No complaints. I quite like it. Especially the ending credit sons.

Although I understand that they want to quickly move through long introductions, it kind of annoys me at times. 
You don't really get to personally know the characters as you would in Naruto or AoT for ex. 
You get a quick 1-2 min summary on Saitama & Genos & that's it. 
Maybe it's just personal preference, but I just wanted more.
Other than that, I quite liked most of the characters, both good & evil.
As we move on through the story, we see that Saitama isn't just your goofy, part-time hero. He makes a lot of sacrifices without asking for much because he simply doesn't care.
In one episode, he sacrifices his own dignity as a Hero to not allow the public to bring down the other Heroes. He lusted to be admired, but dropped it immediately when it came down to it.
He's actually...pretty admirable lmao
His powers are ridiculous & he's beyond any of the S Class Heroes [highest rank Heroes], but they managed to put in some admirable points about him.

Overall, I personally enjoyed it. It does get docked off 1 point because I don't think it should get a 10 because of what I said about the characters though.

\\ spoiler alert just in case //
Art: 9/10
Design is awesome, heroes design looks great, their appearance matches their name perfectly, monsters look awesome, we get to see big variety of monsters for example House of evolution monsters, Deep sea king, Boros and his crew. Studio did a great job, so 9 it is.
Characters: 9/10I'll just talk about our 2 MC to keep it short.
1st is Saitama, main protagonist, in begining we can see he lives alone in city Z, he one punches everything and is frustrated by his power, because he has no real opponent ( except of mosquitoes), one day he saves Genos our 2nd protagonist. 
Genos is a cyborg who is hunting down a mad cyborg, when he sees Saitama's immense strength, he insist on becoming his disciple, even though Saitama didn't want he accept him eventually. In combat Genos usually underestimates his opponent a little bit and end up in pieces. He is extremely fast, not many can keep up with him.
Character progression: 9/10
Through the season we can see Saitama meeting new people, making friends, "" rivals"", we get to see his past before he lost his hair. He has to deal with dilemas, for example being confronted by two heroes accusing him of destroying city, even though he saved a lot of lives and minimized the possible damage, ONE really nice thing about Saitama is: he isn't selfish at all, when he one punches a strong opponent that defeated many heroes, he says it was because all of heroes weakened him so it was easy to defeat it, it is a really nice trait of Saitama. We also see Genos trying to get stronger to match his master, there is much more, but I wanna keep it short, so it's not too long. 
Story: 9/10
It is a comedy so I'll go softer on story. Our MC is frustrated, because he cannot find an opponent, who would be a challenge for him. He meets a Cyborg called Genos and saves him from being completely destroyed, after little bit of "" pretty please"" Saitama takes Genos as his disiple, both of them apply to hero academy. After series of tests Genos is ranked as a S class hero and Saitama as lowest C class hero, even though he broke every possible physical record in tests, but his knowledge test didn't go so well. After that our protagonists meet with various heroes defeat monsters, asteroids ( or meteorite) and in the last episodes we see them fight aliens and Saitama lands on moon. 9 it is.
Story progression: 8/10
Story goes fluently, pacing is good, not much else to say.
Sound: 9/10 ( in my subjective mind I would give it 10/10)
I was really tempted to give it 10. Fighting soundtracks are sick, opening and ending song are marvelous it was super close to 10 not much else to say.
Villains: 8/10
Genus: 8/10 Scientist aiming ( well, was aiming, not anymore :)) to change to world and create a perfect race, I like his motivation and he was okay, plus we get see his "" experiment results, AKA moster team that was destroyed by Saitama"" he was okay so I'll stick with 8.
Boros: 8/10 Strongest character who faced Saitama, leader of pirates attacking other planets, put up a really epic fight against Saitama, ultimately Saitama used his "" Serious punch"" and killed him. He pretty much existed to be last ep. super epic fight and he did great, doesn't really have a backstory except of being extremely powerful being that attack planets and was told one day he'll find a wothy opponent, so also 8.
Comedy: 10/10
This was obvious to everyone it will be 10, not much to say. OPM is a masterpice of
comedy, creator of many memes. I'll use some examples of comedy: Obviously mosquitoes, long and booorin ( I mean interesting) backstory of Genos, Saitama eating vegetable parts of monster
Writer thoughs: I forgot to include this category in OPM 2nd -_-, well I would rate it 9/10, here have a banana.
Sooo overall rating of One Punch Man is 8,88/10 meaning 8, even though it's really close to 9 I use rating style 8 - 8,99 = 8 \||/ 9 - 9,99 = 9. OPM is and will be the best comedy anime I've ever seen. and 8,88 is very strong score.
If I were to rate it subjectively ( going with my heart) I would give 9.",8,PeterFromRussia

                MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD
The first anime that I ever watched without being spoiled any of the contents, One Punch Man sort of bridges the line between Slice of Life in the early episodes, but later moves more towards bloody action with the other heroes. Saitama as a character isn't actually as boring as I thought he would be. As the description says, he is just a normal guy who trained really hard. The supporting cast is also great, from Genos to Tatsumaki, characters who have a set personality that isn't boring or degrading. Animation is fantastic, courtesy of MadHouse studios, along with a kickass intro and

                One punch man may be a fast paced anime but its shows that being too powerful isn't always so great and it shows a great way of it.

I mean he could literally destroyed the whole earth in less than a second but he didn't it really shows that saitama is kind.
The art style and sound of the show is amazing with the effects of everyone's ability and how powerful they are. The characters are pretty memorable especially
                  saitama and even if I watched a long time ago I still remember most of them. I really enjoyed the series that I litteraly rewatched the entire anime again it's so fun and funny I love every second of it. Anyways this is why it's one of my favourite of all time.",10,Kei_Ichikawa

                One Punch Man is a series I look back on fondly and will probably rewatch in the future. It is not an amazing series, but it is charming.
Before the series, all I knew was he could beat everything in one punch and he had a side-kick who followed him everywhere. In the first few episodes, this was the case. They were enjoyable, with very good animation, but at that point, I probably would have rated it a 5.
For me, episode 5 is when things pick up and it goes from solely a bad guy/s of the week show and introduces some interesting world building, which
                  has elevated my score and enjoyment of the series. Even though the reputation of the 2nd season makes me unsure whether to watch it, after watching this season, I want to watch more One Punch Man.

                One Punch Man is a very enjoyable watch. The show's premise is that of a hero who, after years of training, got strong enough to kill any opponent after a single hit (hence the name duh). While this could be the story of every second isekai, this show tackles the subject of simply being too strong exceptionally well. It's not a power fantasy but rather a comedic look at the daily life and boredom of the strongest hero there is.
This show has a broad cast of likeable but somewhat flat characters. Most of them get their time to shine in some of the many bombastic
                  and over-the-top action scenes this show offers. The stakes are never really high as the heros of the show rarely face any severe consequences because of their fights. The light-hearted spirit of the show adds to that lack of suspense. This is, however, not a bad thing as this show focusses on entertainment and comedy.
Speaking of comedy, the joke is more or less always that some hero desperately struggles against a strong opponent and then Saitama comes along, killing the beast with a single punch. While that may sound repetitive, the strong comedic timing and lack of episodes manage to keep it funny. 
This show's insane success and popularity make it an essential watch of recent years. One Punch Man managed not to bore me once for it's 12 episodes of runtime and for that alone, I'd highly recommend putting it on your watchlist.",8,NytexX

Story: 7
I can already feel the hateful comments, so yeah, OPM is a good show, but it kinda lacks in what a real show needs, plot. Now it isn't like it doesn;t have any, but what is there severely lacked depth, it was just, ""Hey, this really powerful dude is so powerful, he can kill anyone in one punch, so lets watch him beat the crap out of people."" And they continued that for 12 episodes. It would become dull if the show wasn't so visually impressive.
Art: 9
The art in OPM is wonderful, top tier type of art, which is thanks to Studio Madhouse and Yusuke Murata. No matter how predictable the fight gets, the art always trumps it, with the special effects like the fire, to the stream, and the lightning and the amount of effort put into the art is just phenomenal and i wouldn't change it a bit, but it could have been better.
Sound: 9
Just as good as the art, the OP is one that i still hold in treasure to this day, and rivals the openings of Noragami, Attack on Titan and Naruto, yes, I said Naruto, it rivals one of the Big Three. And i am not kidding.
Character: 7
Saitama is pretty funny, he has some dry humor at times which makes me think, ""Is he really serious?"" And that is what makes me hold him as one of my favorite anime characters to this day, rivaling that of Eren Yeager and Kanna Kamui.
Enjoyment: 8
I thoroughly enjoyed this show, from the lights, to the sound to the epic battle scenes, to yes even the villains, this show was like a bucket of cocaine, cause it sure as hell kept the dopamine flowing and my inevitable stroke coming even faster, as i screamed my head off at Saitama vs Boros.

                This anime is great. The fact the protagonist is overpowered (not really a spoiler, as the it's implied in the name) is handled exceptionally well, and so OPM is more self aware than other shows. This creates a hilarious aspect of comedy, while simultaneously an aspect of frustration (at points).
At no point did I feel like an episode was wasted time, or that I could've skipped an episode and I wouldn't have been affected by the story missed. The only critique I would have over this is that the penultimate episode felt a *bit* unnecessary, however it adds to the suspense and tension the watcher
                  faces before the final episode.
I told my friend about this, and he said that it was very much like Deadpool. Which I have to agree with, and is a great analogy actually. Both these characters have very little concern when it comes to battling, and do take the piss during fights (again, another comedy aspect)

                Read the anime title. Just from that, you should have a sense as to how the main character will live his life. It's pretty straightforward. One punch is all it takes for this man to take out an enemy.
What kind of enemy, you may ask? Well... Whether if it's a giant capable of sweeping an entire city by himself or even the lord of an alien invasion, they're all dead in one punch.
That's pretty much the story. You would say that it would get boring if that's the case, but the author has more to it in the story and believe me or not, he
                  isn't the only spotlight of this show.
The other characters will get screen time and you might even get more attached to them than the main character. The One Punch Man will still be the real hero of everything in this, but this anime show development in some of the side characters that will make this anime more interesting than you thought it would.
Sure, the one punch man power might be enough to keep you entertained, but I assure you, the other characters also have a pretty great story behind their backs. You should also take them into consideration and that's what makes this anime a 9/10 for me. 
Even with the simple element of a power being the anime title, to think that this anime has more than that to offer, is something that is worthy of being an iconic anime for everyone.

                tl;dr: An anime that while not particularly deep has a lot of style, an amusing cast, and great comedy, which makes it a pretty enjoyable watch overall.
One Punch Man is a show about a guy named Saitama who is literally invincible. Nothing anyone else does seems to hurt him and he can take out pretty much any enemy with a single punch. As such this anime somewhat of a parody of super heroes and super sentai in that it’s exaggerating things for comedic effect. However, it isn’t entirely a parody as his strength is important to the story beyond it’s comedic value. As he can
                  defeat any foe easily, the plot has to work around that, and in doing so it manages to be a take on the genre that goes in directions that usually aren’t gone down. With Saitama himself, the focus is on his role in the world. He’s all powerful but due to his passive personality that just seems to go with the flow on everything this doesn’t offer him a lot of benefits. He really doesn’t have the personality of someone incredibly strong, and thus no one really believes in his strength unless they see it in action, sometimes not even then, and just in general he’s a pretty passive person that very rarely cares all that much about most things, so he doesn’t really try to convince them. Thus the portions of the plot centered around him are focused around him just trying to keep up with being a super hero in terms of the more mundane aspects of being super powered. Over the course of the anime, he gets somewhat more fleshed out, though it doesn’t really feel like there’s any sort of character arc for him or anything like that. In exchange for that, he’s pretty consistently hilarious and elevates the comedy in the show to being incredibly good.
An important distinction to make is that while Saitama is invincible, he’s certainly not omniscient or omnipresent. Rather, he’s actually really slow at getting to the enemies he has to defeat. As such, while he is the main character, a heavy portion of the plot is focused on other character’s who get there earlier and actually have to fight properly. While Saitama’s fights are basically just comedy, the fights involving other characters are taken completely seriously. They are legitimately really good battles that get really intense. A lot of them end with Saitama arriving and one punching the enemy that other heroes were having so much trouble with, but that too is made more satisfying due to how the battle with the other heroes allows the villain to be properly built up as someone that beating so easily is amazing.
The heavy focus on characters other than Saitama extends beyond just the combat and overall the anime has a pretty strong cast of side characters. The most important of these is Genos who serves as Saitama’s apprentice and is the other main character. He is incredibly straight laced which contrasts well with Saitama and serves to highlight both of their characters to amusing effect. He also starts off incredibly edgy, but he actually has a decent character arc where he becomes less focused on power and more relaxed essentially. The rest of the cast is incredibly simplistic and pretty flat to be honest, but there’s enough variety to them and a lot of them have a tremendous amount of style and personality so they’re interesting anyway. The world is somewhat similar to that. It’s incredibly simple, with cities simply being labelled with letters such as “City A” or “City Z” with no real attempt at world building, fleshing out politics, nations, or anything like that. It doesn’t even attempt to explain where the villains are coming from most of the time and usually seems to gloss over all the destruction and death that happens. However, this allows the world to basically be defined by the heroes that inhabit it, and thus while not deep at all it holds up quite well.
The art and animation also greatly enhances this anime. The designs overall are pretty excellent and the action is animated incredibly well. Some of the fight scenes are downright amazing due to how dynamic they feel. I will note that there was more gore than I was expecting. It’s also good at showing expressions, particularly with Saitama, who often in the middle of intense moments in highly detailed scenes gets switched to a duller art style to show how bored he is with everything. The OP fits the anime perfectly in terms of visuals and audio and gets you hyped for the episode. The soundtrack also fit really well and enhanced the anime. The ED is a pretty generic ED which is okay I suppose. Ultimately, I’d say the anime was made incredibly well, wherein even though I don’t think it excels in any individual aspect tremendously enough for the renown it’s given, each aspect plays off the others well enough to make the anime consistently really enjoyable from beginning to end.",9,hexashadow13

One Punch Man is my comfort anime...because it never fails to make me laugh.
One punch man is the only anime I consider to be perfect. It is only 13 eps, but if it were any longer, I think the show would lose some of its quality.
OPM is a comedy that parodies many tropes found in anime and storytelling in general.
It is very hard to explain why OPM is so good. Saitama is so strong that he beats any enemy with a single punch, so he faces no conflict. How is a show supposed to carry on with a MC that faces no conflict and therefore
                  does not develop? OPM builds conflict through the struggles of its side characters, and Saitama tends to fade into the background at times. It may seem really weird, but it just works, and it is what makes One Punch Man unique.
If you do not understand what I am talking about, just go watch it. It is only 13 eps. You will love it.",10,knightofrem

                It is a great anime with action, which if you are not into, has the perfect mix of comedy. The comedy mixed with the action scenes does not get in the way and still leaves more to want. One Punch is comedic art and just art in general. The characters work well together and serve a purpose in the story. No characters leave you wanting less of them. While people may think that the idea of all Saitama's fights ending in one punch may get tiring, it really doesn't. Saitama lets himself get hit and pushed around by the enemy, showing you the enemy's capabilities
                  before they get obliterated. Even those who are not into foreign films/animation are able to get into One Punch. It is a must-watch if not watched already.",10,Weeb_and_Proud

                Considering how much potential this series had to go wrong, its amazing that it turned out as great as it is, thanks to the studio and animators being great at visual comedy, and the creation of just enough mundane problems for Saitama to keep his story from getting too one-note. 
The supporting cast is also great; the Hero association providing some great and ridiculous hero designs - with some great fleshing out of some characters by the end, giving me high hopes for the second season.
I hold particular love for the cordial Mumen Rider, who we should learn to emulate in our everyday lives by
                  taking part in good deeds everyday, no matter how small or incredible they may be.

                I already watched this anime like three years ago (in fact it was the first anime I watched), but I decided to rewatch it because I needed something entertaining and fun, without a heavy story or complex plot. And that's what this anime is: pure epic entertainment.
The story is pretty simple. A ridiculously powerful hero defeating ridiculously powerful villains with only one punch, but he finds it boring so he is constantly looking for someone to give him a good fight. That said, someone can think the fight scenes would be short and boring... but nope. This anime is constantly showing amazingly animated fight sequences.
                  You can send him an army of monsters and he will kill each one of them with only one punch, but it's still really fun, and the soundtrack also helps a lot in this matter.
This is a show that does not take itself seriously and everything is told in a satirical, hilarious way. The villains are plain stupid with really bizarre designs and simple motives, but it's so fun seeing them fight Saitama.
So, yeah, that's pretty much it. If you are looking for a hilariously entertaining and absurd anime, this one is perfect. Heck, this is even better than the modern superhero/comedy movies we see in theatres.",8,Leto2073

                Out of all the anime I've seen, this is probably my favorite piece. It is done so well compared to any other anime I can think of that it's almost unnecessary to review, the show speaks for itself. 
First I'd like to comment on the art direction, the animators must have rotoscoped actual actors moving and fighting, then animated over them. There are scenes where the animation has such a gritty and visceral feel to it, some transitions that work so well for the art style that I thought I might be watching A Scanner Darkly or alice in wonderland. It's got a great color
                  palette and utilizes the nature of the show to its advantage in that department, giving really crazy and interesting colors to all of the characters and villains. This manages to make characters who's names I've forgotten easily recognizable, as well as making room for great lighting choices, which the show also takes advantage of. It's not innocent of falling into some tropes, but they seem more like quirks than detriments to its quality.
The story is also quite refreshing, something so much more pure and unadulterated than the pretentious writing of other shows, it almost reminded me of Shin-chan or Champloo, where the characters are just gonna do what they want and the story can try its best to impress them. It takes a lot more from the comedy elements of anime than its does the action or fighting, since the show really does end most fights with one punch man punching guys one time and killing them. The writing for Saitama is pretty flawless, you understand his motivations and flaws, you can relate to and empathize with his problems and its very natural to feel happy when he finally accomplishes something, no matter how small of a victory it seems to us. The sidekick character is somewhat enjoyable too, when he was introduced in the story I kinda had my moment of ""ohhh..."" and feared the refreshing comedy would get watered down by his plight to stop some robot or something, but immediately afterwards I'm shown once more how seriously the show takes itself by how the cyborg explains his past, lol.
Some of its faults lie in the lack of a central plot, it completely works for Saitama, but almost every other character aside from the tsundere trap ninja seems like an NPC that's just waiting for Saitama to come around like the player character in a game. The show luckily isn't about them and focuses on the inner turmoil of Saitama, but I can see where having some B plots with the sidekick would be refreshing had the show not taken such a dramatic turn in the actual second season.
I don't even need to give this show a score, or a review, or any attention at all, it's so apathetic to the viewers that it will stand as a shining example of what good writing and animation can do for a show long after people have forgotten about that incredibly bland second season.",8,QuietGrave

                One Punch Man is a masterpiece in the history of anime. It did a great job transforming the funny looking manga by ONE to a vivid anime with fantastic art styles. It portrays a world with heroes and monsters. The main character is Saitama, a bald man in his 20s. For unknown reason, Saitama was able to train himself to become the ultimate hero, who is extremely strong and kills any monster with one punch. The anime tells the story of Saitama and his daily life with friends and monsters. The reason why I really love this anime is that it has a really great
                  sense of humor. By combining the exciting fight scenes with the boring and funny daily life of Saitama, the producers of this anime was able to find the perfect balance. It might look like it belongs in the superhero genre, but it actually challenges many of the traditional expectations. While most superheros start from being weak, Saitama is the skill ceiling of this anime since the very first episode. I strongly recommend everyone to check One Punch Man out if you haven't done so.",10,ILikeAnime77777

                MEGA DISCLAIMER: Anyone thinking that the general premise must get boring, and the anime has no potential for good fight scenes or anything like that, please give it a shot! My exact thoughts were ""Oh, One Punch Man? Let me guess, he kills everything immediately and the final boss is, OMG TWO PUNCHES?!"" I could not have been more wrong about this show. Please hear out my review. This is an amazing anime. No, the concept does not get boring.
This anime is truly great. Yes, there is *a lot* of hype around it, and everything that gets hyped about has haters, but this anime is
                  truly, truly (my vocabulary ran out of words) wonderful. Definitely one of my favourites (if only MAL let you have more than 10).
Story: Without getting too spoiler heavy, this anime centralises around Saitama, the One Punch Man. I won't go into plot specifics, as it is not allowed and there is a blurb ^ there. I thoroughly enjoyed OPM, it's story was great and engaging, and the near non-stop action was fantastic. Couple this with great comedy, and wonderful parodies of the shounen and superhero genres, and you have yourself a great anime. 10/10.
Art: Again, I'm not the best for art, but this show has definitely got some great art. It may appear minamilistic with it's main character's lack of hair (in a shounen?!) but during the action scenes it can become GODLY. 9/10.
Sound: The OP and ED were absolute gems, as well as some of the background music for this anime. The soundtrack suited the fight scenes perfectly, and some were even in sync with the music. Truly a wonderful spectacle to behold. 10/10.
Character: For a show titled 'One Punch Man', it does actually have some great non-OPM characters, whose stories get developed and revealed overtime, even if some are a bit cliche. The cliche-ness of some, only serves to further the humour and enjoyability of the anime though. 10/10.
Overall: As an overall view, I myself may have been sucked into the hype for this show, and may have some trouble looking at this anime without any bias. But I truly believe that it deserves its rating. This anime has great animation, and some of the best fight scenes in anime that I have seen to date, as well as all of the previously discussed points, and wonderful comedy that actually succeeded to make me laugh out loud, a rare feat. I am giving this anime a 10/10.",10,Springball64

                A perfect recommendation to people who have never watched anime.
After just watching the first 10 minutes of the first episode, you have already decided that you want to watch the entire thing.
It is easy to understand,if you like superhero movies and/or series you will definetly enjoy yourself while watching this.
The humour and characters are also top notch. 
However the main selling point of this season is:
1. The animation, there is not much more to say, its flawless.
2. The action, the action is very good and you can feel the impact from every punch, you also get excited to see how the fight plays out. 
3.
                  The villains, there are many obscure villains, all with different and unique powers.
The intro also slaps.",8,blaavane

                Wow. Just wow. One Punch Man is fantastic.
The story is stupidly simple, A guy can beat anyone with one punch. This may sound like a downside, but the simplicity of the story allows for some many different situations to put the MC Saitama.
The art is ORGASMIC. I'm not one to obsess over sakuga, but One Punch Man makes every frame flow seamlessly together like spreading butter over a pancake. Honestly you could make a gif out of any 5 seconds from this anime. whenever Saitama throws a punch you truly see and feel the absolute destruction that man can create with his hands.
The sound complements
                  the visuals like peanut butter and jelly. It's almost like a comic book with every CRACK, BANG, and THUD. Even if their wasn't music the noises alone would make the action enjoyable.
The characters are simple, yet enjoyable. Saitama is obviously the star of the show and thus gets the most development. The side characters unfortunately aren't very deep. Genos, Mumen Rider, and the villians all seem like generic stereotypes and don't do much more other then set up a satisfying fight.
I thoroughly enjoyed One Punch Man. I felt like I couldn't look away or I'd miss something spectacular.

                Honestly one of my favorite anime of all time. Everything about it is amazing, the art, plot, humor, and action are really top of the class by Madhouse here. Of course, the manga is still slightly better but they are both worthy of the 10/10 rating and there is not much bad that can be said about it. If you enjoy action, comedy, and good animation then this anime is definitely for you, and definitely read the manga starting past episode 12 because it gets even better. There is also a deeper meaning behind the very satirical and simple battles in the series, and it
                  shows that the series slowly develops from a parody to having a much more serious plot.",10,ShadowEric

One-Punch Man is easily top-tier anime.
This anime combines everything that is good about anime and expands even further on it. It’s a satirical take on shounen anime and shounen characters, that combines a unique and interesting narrative, brilliant sound design, flawless animation, and top-tier characters.
The story itself is constructed on the base idea, that a protagonist in a story is without a doubt going to beat the antagonist. So what is the point of steadily increasing their power, they may as well be automatically all-powerful. That’s the story of Saitama, a man who is so powerful that he is bored of fighting and can’t
                  enjoy it. On top of the premise, the world-building of this anime is incredible and is something that should be watched instead of reading in a review. Although, many plot lines are left untied and aren’t expanded on. If future seasons expand on these plot lines then that would be good but for now. That is the main flaw of the One-Punch Man's story.
The sound design is brilliant, the sound effects make every fight feel and sound brutal. I’d compare it to David's productions level of sound effects. The voice acting is even better, Saitama’s voice actor can at any time make his character sound harmless and then change it so he sounds terrifying. The soundtrack is what brings the entire sound tier together, the music sound intense and puts you on the edge do your seat in every fight. The op is something else, if you listen to it consistently it gets old quickly but it still hits hard when you first hear it.
Anyone who has watched the series can agree that the animation is nearly flawless. The animation of fight scenes feels so smooth and creates an idea of how truly powerful these characters are. The art style is brilliantly translated and the transition from manga to anime is done so brilliantly. Saitama’s appearance changing from a simple stupid art style when he isn’t serious to a way more advanced and complex art style when he is serious is a great use of how art style can reflect the mood of characters. It goes without saying that there are very minor flaws in the animation of One-Punch Man season 1.
Saitama is a unique take on an anime protagonist, unlike other characters who strive to be stronger. Saitama is already at the top. And as a result, he is bored of his power, because he can’t be enjoying anything. This is reflected in the character of Genoa, who is your typical shounen protagonist. He is the disciple of Saitama and reflects every protagonist, a guy with a motive and is flawed. To combat the lack of conflict Saitama faces, he faces the conflict of getting recognition for his feats. Because of his appearance, everyone assumes he is weak. His driving force is to at the very least get recognition for his power that has resulted in him being bored.
The parody of shounen anime constructs a unique premise with brilliant sound design, characters, and god-tier animation. A perfect mix of everything that is good in anime, that hooked me into anime.
Overall, I rank this 9/10.",9,OfficialBandit

                One Punch Man was my introduction to anime back in 2019. I watched the show again this past December, and found it maintained the same charm that I found in it the first time. There is an appealing story that makes the show very attainable for a Western audience with the superhero-centric story. The characters are charming, and I was personally very enthralled to the pure number of heroes (and villains) that the show has to offer. Sure, the manga sets a great precedent for the depth of characters in the show, but as someone who watched it cold I was very pleasantly surprised. I
                  am a huge fan of collections of characters, and this scratched that itch. I also must mention the soundtrack. The background music was fantastic, and the centerpiece songs were even better. I am not personally a big fan of the introductory song, but I really love the battle theme as an occasional fan of metal. The song in the closing credits is also fantastic, I love the beginning that includes some (perhaps) Christmas-y sounds. As main characters go, I must say I love Saitama as a character, his spectrum of personalities is hilarious in retrospect, and very fun. I am not a huge fan of Genos, I think he brings a needed level of seriousness to the show that I did not want to admit it needed. I very much enjoyed this show due to its collection of characters and its soundtrack, and I wish there was a second season that matched the art of this season, which pops. Overall, very good show!",8,SirVada

                Imma keep this a short review.
I liked this anime. It has a pretty unique story that seems kinda boring at first, but then changes and becomes really entertaining. So I give the story a 7/10 for being unique and fun.
Art is pretty much like any other anime, but the details in some scenes are very good, so for that, that's also a 7/10.
Sound is nice, voice actors are great, music is good, and the op is really catchy. Very iconic op and I really liked it. It was one of those intros that you don't skip. Sound is a 7/10.
(Btw everything about the anime in
                  my opinion has a stable 7/10 so I won't rate stuff anymore)
Characters are likeable, especially the main characters. I really liked the Saitama character. He was like a living ""no f**ks given"". I loved that, and Genos was a really good character as well. I don't really remember much about other characters because it was like 2 years ago I watched this, but still I remember the characters as good.
To end this review I'd like to say that this anime is great to watch if you've just started getting into anime. And it does make sense why so many people have watched it. Hell, even non-anime watchers enjoyed this show. This anime can be watched and enjoyed by almost anyone, and that's awesome. If you're experienced in anime and have for some reason not watched this, it's really nothing spectacular, but it's still good. A rounded 7/10 for me. Maybe woulda given it a high 6 if I could, but MAL only supports whole numbers so it's a 7. Anyway, that wraps this review up, and I hope you found it helpful.",7,EnMask

                This shit is hilarious, somehow they made the most motivational anime this new generation has see. Train hard and you will be OP basically is what I got from the anime. Fights were perfectly dumb, OP has never been done so well. Usually the characters are arrogant and discredit everything that got the there, but Saitama is not one not one of those ass clowns. One Punch has just enough fights plus comic relief to please anyone. The journey he takes through out the show you really don't know where it will lead, but the destination you reach is impeccable, I could not ask for
                  more. Relationships in the anime are perfect in the sense that, they feel like how I am with my neighbor or someone I work out at the gym with.

                One Punch Man? One punch line: it's only funny for so long.
I finally finished this show on my second attempt to get into it. The first time I didn't make it past the first episode. The comedy was too over-the-top and lacked wit or charm for me. However, with the show gaining widespread acclaim, I decided to give it another chance to gain a first-hand opinion. My conclusion is that though One Punch Man has some redeeming qualities, it largely fails to deliver.
Wherein does One Punch Man fail? The biggest flaw lies in its main character. Saitama is a hobbyist hero who has become disenchanted
                  by the fact that he defeats every foe with just one punch. He is so overpowered that he has become bored and unmotivated. That in and of itself is an interesting premise, but it's hard to relate to a character who has zero personality. His constant nonchalance is juxtaposed against the passionate outbursts of his enemies to comedic effect. Unfortunately, this same formula is tediously repeated throughout the show. It was mildly funny the first time, but the joke gets old very fast.
The villains likewise lack personality and couldn't get more superficial. They are simple trope villains who are evil for the sake of being evil. This is by design so that the show can take a lighter tone and avoid a dark complex story. However, it is a huge detriment when both the protagonist and the antagonists are one-dimensional characters who can only tell one joke.
The side characters are what save this show from completely falling by the wayside. Though there are plenty of expendable side characters, there are some that get enough screen time and development to be likeable. When the show incorporated repeating side characters instead of just expendable ones, the story moved from a formulaic episodic format to one that promised some semblance of a plot. Unfortunately, this occurs too late in the show to fully compensate for the negatives of the first half.
Further seasons might change my mind, but as it stands, One Punch Man is a show that fails in its characters, fails in half of its comedy, and fails to develop an intriguing plot. I found the first half of the show a chore for me to get through, and it wasn't until the show relied on something more than its one punch line that I became somewhat invested. It has some potential to grow into something more, so hopefully further seasons can fix the defects this show currently suffers from. Lightly entertaining, but a bit of a drag gets this show a 6 out of 10.",6,WanTaisho

                Many shonen's follow protagonists on their long journey to becoming the most powerful. Studio Madhouse's One Punch Man cuts rights to the end as we follow Saitama on his quest to overcome boredom after becoming the strongest being alive. What I found most entertaining about this show was its characters, particularly Saitama, and how they interact. While Saitama is a subversion of a shonen protagonist, everyone else is a shonen stereotype turned up to a hundred. This creates really lopsided dynamics between Saitama and the other characters, such as Genos, with their intensity contrasted by Saitama's dull reactions. Furthermore, I think it's impossible to talk
                  about this show without mentioning its animation, which is some of the best I have seen in any property. Every fight feels like the anime is just showing off to its viewers, with even scenes such as Saitama trying to swat a fly being visually impressive. The use of visual comedy in this show is pretty good too, with Saitama often switching between being simple and cartoony to heavily detailed in the blink of an eye. Overall, I thought that this show knows when it should and shouldn't take itself seriously, which lets it achieve a level of just pure fun that I find most shonen's fail to.",9,Notoriousrdd

                Before I make my review I will say to at least watch it once to do your own opinion. 
The anime is decent enough. I have watched it before but I didn't get past episode 3 for some season so this is my second time watching it. One Punch is a weird show in my opinion but it has some entertaining moments. 
From the first episode, I thought One Punch was a bootleg anime version of Superman but I was proven wrong. The anime did not make me hooked until Episode 5. I like the idea of a super strong guy who can take on
                  any monsters and get bored after a while, to me, this part seems realistic because since he could do anything, it would get boring after a while. I have mixed feelings about this part because I think it's making fun of heroes but at the same time it isn't...but then again it's a parody of shounen animes/mangas. 
Also, I like how the MC isn't as fairly attractive as other male characters. (according to my friend). The lack of hair could be a factor in this but you have to admit he doesn't look like regular male main characters. It's kind of unique to me. 
My issue is I get that Saitama gets bored of fighting but the fight scenes were kind of boring. They could have at least made it interesting. There's hardly any drama or intense scenes, it just seems bland and I understand why because the MC is mary-sues but they could have at least tried to spice it up. 
Overall the plot is alright, I was kind of disappointed because of how people have hyped this anime, but it was decent.",6,BeepitsAme

                So you all know that one anime where the MC is trying to become stronger during the episodes, scrap that One Punch Man doesn't care about becoming stronger, because he is already the strongest is the world.
In the anime we see how life is for a hero who is just to strong for this world and that if you are to power full is not fun.
The story is pretty good. Because it always has some interresting problem and solution for that problem.
The art is very good for a action anime. I make beautifull use of smudges for rapid movement
The characters are the big part which
                  is laking in my oppinion, because you just see so many caracters who are just straight up boring.

I love this show. Its hilarious and a nice twist in the shounen action genre. The story follows the existential dilemma of Saitama, who is so powerful its boring. This leads to surprisingly hilarious situations and the world is rich with colorful heroes, villains, and side characters that will make your viewing experience everything but boring. Its just too bad the second season (while still enjoyable) does not live up to the excellent first season.
Story
The story is very well constructed. While over the top, the characters feel like they really do somehow live in their crazy world where getting discounts at the grocery store
                  mean a lot. While Saitama is so powerful he can defeat any enemy without trying, what happens before after and in-between is enjoyable to the end.
Art Sound
No complains, really good art and really good sound.
Characters
The characters really make an outrageous world somehow seem livable. In especially how the villains interact with the characters can lead to intense, hilarious, and highly entertaining fights and situations. Saitama is a legend, not only for his power, but for his determination in living cheaply.
Overall
Don't discount the initial premise. While the main character is overpowered by his own admission, the world around him is surprisingly balanced. There are all grades of heroes and villains trying to get by in their own small or big ways and One Punch Man interestingly explores aspects of action shounen that are actually rarely explored. While the second season doesnt quite live up to its very excellent first, I can't recommend this anime enough.",9,polaris97

                Unpopular opinion incoming, but I thought One Punch Man was super overrated. 
Reminded me a bit of Gurren Lagan near the end, how the villains kept getting bigger and bigger. The show did a good job of driving home the point that you don't need to be recognized to be a hero. Soundtrack was a perfect fit, and visually, Madhouse knocked this one out of the park. 
However, One Punch Man started to lose its ""Wow"" factor about half way through. It didn't decline in quality or anything, but the later episodes just didn't impress me like the earlier ones had.

The author/writer is really smart as it is very hard to execute a character which defeats enemies with one hit, AT THE STARTING I THOUGHT THE ANIME WOULD HAVE A GREAT BIULD UP JUST FOR A PUNCH and I thought every episode would be same( a build up of 15 min which ends with a PUNCH

Problem A. I think it’s totally fine that MC is completely OP, because that’s what the anime is about, but it subtracts from that when every single other S class hero is also OP. When nothing happens to these S class heros (final episode for example) it completely diminishes the danger. Old guy should have died or been terribly injured in ep 12.
Problem B. MC's clothes where often destroyed in battles, (makes sense because it’s no where near how strong he is) but then it takes like no damage in the
                  last episode when he fights the one eyed dude. Clothes should have been obliterated.
Also all my positive rating are for the first season, the second one was boring as sh*t.",8,SuperFire64

One Punch Man is a parody and satirical work based around heroes. The archetypal cycle  of a hero is usually as follows, the call to adventure in which a hero is influenced by an event, idea, person or action that makes the hero feel the need to act, then the ordeal, transformation and finally, the hero's return. Through a representation of common troupes and the variation put on them One punch man formulates a story unlike any of its genre. 
Overview: One Punch Man takes place
                  in a world ravaged by so called ""monsters"" and mysterious beings. The human civilization has come now developed in a continent where individual areas are called cities. In a world with such conflict there are those known as heroes these heroes fight against monsters to protect humanity. One such hero is Saitama the protagonist this self proclaimed hero has a rather ironic problem. Saitama is no longer challenged as a hero. Any monster he fights can be killed with one nonchalant punch. The use of this irony is what makes One Punch Man categorized as satire and parody. A hero requires a problem to face lack of conflict has developed its own nuanced conflict, a internal conflict in which a hero can find no purpose or meaning. 
Story: 8/10
This anime is formulated from the warping of common troupes and a deepened attention given to their values. The story is credited because of a nuance based around the understanding of such troupes and the understanding required to portray them in a realistic way. The world it self leaves a lot to be desired,  but this too goes to further the storylines capabilities. The author was building a government and system that is easy to develop especially because the story is formed around the standard make up of a hero's world. By expecting the standard troupes and focusing more on the inhabitants the author can control the viewer attention. The lack of detail really isn't important on such a character oriented story. Some say the story is somewhat redundant but personally I think the stories focus on characters is to counteract this redundancy. By introducing new elements of the story such as setting the author can control the output of each element of the story. If the characters are boring focus on the setting an widen the world view. The story takes place on one continent and as far as we know there is more human habitation. By introducing the world in such a vague manner the viewers are left to wonder. Instead of just distracting us the author has created genuine interest. ""If this show was to subvert or expectations as it usually does what should we expect?"" the viewers wonder this, and the world itself is left to be redefined and a open slate to the authors whims. There may not be much to the world in terms of originality but the potential to carry on the story in no certain terms is very interesting to viewers such as myself. By rousing curiosity when new settings are introduced the transition won't be jarring. The formation of a world that could potentially change in a single episode is a great addition to a show mocking stereotypes and subverting expectations.
But, in terms of what has actually been developed the stories method of using stereotypes is really all it has going for it. The story is a vast well of untapped potential. (I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THIS IS COMPLETLY SPOILER FREE SO VERY VAUAGE IN TERMS OF ACTUAL HAPPENING)
10/10
Art
I'm sure you've heard. The art is great. The actual character designs go to further the comedy and the troupes. The dramatic and over-exaggerated art furthers the story a lot. The characters can look cool, silly or insane all to match the mood. The fights are amazing.
8/10
Sound
The dub is great, as is the sub. Both are funny. 
7/10
characters
Saitama is a great variation of the hero troupes. I value the way characters interact and this anime lacks in this area. The characters aren't especially memorable for their personalities but the roles they serves as a archetype. The characters match the archetypes and that dictates how they interact. I feel that the character interactions are shallow as they don't follow a role of personality, but of roles. The antagonists and main characters are the only ones that are developed. The 2nd season attempts to fix this issue. So the characters score are once again gaining potential to rise. Yet the story values these roles, so in terms of being consistent in the roles the characters serve to the story overall, i'd give a 10.
Enjoyment 10/10
I love this anime. It is my favorite anime. It is comedic and yet has a deep theme and value system. I love the way the world is developing. I love the characters. I love the way the nuances it presents to the audience can be understood through both contrast and analysis. The way this story is formulated, it can be enjoyed by both lovers of the superhero genre and those who hate it. It allows even those oblivious to the deep nature of the show to be able to understand why and how the story works. This show is truly for the viewers. This anime has formed itself around the traditional values of Shonen anime and turned these values on its head. I love the way it subverts expectations just because the viewers know what to expect. I love this parody. It is art. 
Overall...
Watch it! It provides a contrast from anything you have ever seen. That is the art of parody.",8,Da_Contradiction

                One-Punch Man
Based on a webcomic series by the author ""One"", this story was drawn by the artist Murata in a new and fascinating style.  And with the combined work of Madhouse, nothing stood in the way of this season's success. 
The story of One Punch Man is simple, at least at the beginning. The concept revolves simply around a man who wanted to become strong and, after relentless training, lost his limit and his hair.  He was no longer able to enjoy his fights because simply no one could take a single punch from him. 
Is that all? No definitely not. One-Punch Man
                  is a parody series that uses light satire to recreate many familiar shounen clichés. The running gag that the protagonist can defeat almost any opponent with one punch is rather incidental here. The focus is strongly on the humorous undertone of the series and the focus on the supporting characters. 
Through this very gentle and creative combination of character-based humor and not too exaggerated parody, a very successful atmosphere was created. 
[Story 3]
The first season practically symbolizes the prologue of the story before the actual plot gets going and consists of several small short arcs (on average 2-3 episodes). 
Here, as a rule, most of the characters are introduced and confronted with various monsters, which resulted in quite epic battles. 
Particularly important here is the detailed and dynamic presentation of the respective arcs and the atmosphere that surrounds these simple battles. You can practically grasp the dynamics in the air. 
As mentioned, One Punch Man also has an actual storyline that is already hinted at in some of the first and last episodes and is more present in the background in the manga. However, it will remain relatively incidental before the third season. 
[Characters 5]
Even if the characters seem quite simple and monotonous at the beginning. The secondary characters have far more screentime than the actual protagonist. You see all their bizarre and wacky traits and their interesting introductions to the plot. Since the first season is only a prologue, you only learn limited things about the characters here, but only individual motivations and slight hints at backgrounds like from (Genos, Amai Mask, Bang +)
Although you already know some of the character types, their traits have additionally been made more charismatic, so none seem off-putting or overly monotone. 
Especially the protagonist, who is an interesting walking contradiction. Although he seems relatively adult and indifferent most of the time, he is still an immensely sore loser and can be provoked very quickly. He's mediocre relatively in everything, which can't be solved with physical strength. If it were up to the author's ironically established rules, he would rather tear a planet in half than catch a mosquito. 
Likewise, his fascinatingly self-sacrificing way of throwing away his status just to give others an edge is a testament to his interesting and hard-to-interpret personality. 
[Music 10]
Probably one of the best visual and musical intros you can find anywhere, which practically marketed the anime in the best possible way. Anyone who hears this opening and doesn't think of One Punch Man has probably never heard of it. In addition, with a very pleasant ending that gives an amusing shounen typical atmosphere. 
Accompanied are most scenes, by some of the best soundtracks in the anime scenery. 
[Animations 10]
Madhouse has once again shown their best side here. Dynamics and detail are writ large here. Not only have they managed to represent top-notch choreography, but also fascinatingly detailed environments and dynamic fight animations as well as destruction. 
All of Genos' fights alone were pure art forms with a constantly changing fighting style of the cyborg. 
[Conclusion]
A perfectly balanced parody comedy that could convince with clever humor and appealing characters. In terms of content, this season took the weakest part from the manga but received the biggest budget for it. Had the other arcs been adapted to the same quality, this series would have made immense waves. But even for the content of the first season, Madhouse managed to get the best possible out of the manga.

Story- 3
The first few episodes were really enjoyable and comedic, I found the exaggerated and comedic villains rather endearing and fun. The backstory of the MC was nice if not simple. However, the main problem/joke of the series is dragged out through every episode, and the anticlimactic scenes really start to wear you down.
Basically, the only thing that kept me going to the end was the beautiful art and animation, and the fact that it was only 12 episodes, so I decided might as well finish it.
I'm sure the unique situation
                  of the MC is a big part of why the series is so well received, but I guess I had hopes that it would be resolved or expanded on in some deeper way. Nope, it's literally just 12 episodes of the MC beating people without even trying.
Characters- 3
Character design and initial introductions are really done well. But they're so static...everyone more or less remains the same throughout the whole season. Each character feels like they only have one or two personality traits that they exhibit with every appearance. Debating if I should continue the manga from where the anime left off to see if any of them are developed further.
Art- 10
The animation of the fight scenes are amazingly done which makes sense given the famous studio behind the work. Definitely helps pull engagement points even with the repetitive plot and rather simple characters.
Enjoyment- 5
It's a fun and lighthearted series to temporarily relieve boredom. The fight scenes, though predictable, still have great art. However, nothing in the plot ever made me feel pulled to the next episode, like ""OMG what's gonna happen next?"". None of that really.
Overall- 6
Although the plot (is there even a main plot?) was more disappointing than I had expected, it's still a nice and light series to watch for a few laughs and to appreciate the gorgeous animation. However, if you're coming to this anime expecting character development and unexpected twists, probably should look elsewhere.",6,isaberu33

                This was one of the first ""modern"" anime I ever witnessed, I technically didn't watch it until later because at that time I wasn't into anime and I thought it was really captivating but years later when I watched AOT I had completely changed my perspective.  I mean as a kid I did watch an anime but it was super old and wasn't your typical anime that most people usually think about when they think about an anime.  So even though I watched it already I'm back rewatching cuz I felt like there had to be a review for something as unique and
                  popular as One Punch Man.
One Punch Man is a delightful twist and surprise on the superhero genre as a whole . It takes the problems and the weaknesses of the superhero genre and turns it into something creative and hilarious. Its basically like a parody of the strengths of the superhero genre and what makes the story and the characters so interesting. Its satirical, its overexaggerated, and filled with funny dialogue. One Punch Man is a comedy anime but not just your typical and cliché type though. It has a very good story that consistently gets better as time goes on introducing new characters and building up the world. In its greatness from the uniqueness to it's comedy every time we see a powerful new villain we can ask ourselves is this the guy that's gonna take Saitama down or not.
The characters are solid. The side characters aren't deep or anything too well written and much of the time the focus is around Saitma and his apprentice Genos. So there is nothing else I could say about the characters they are neither very good or very bad so 7 was the perfect score for me. 
The animation is absolutely fantastic probably the best I have seen from any anime and with no CGI whatsoever. The fluidity of the action scenes, the designs of the characters, and the richness of the landscapes makes the world of One Punch Man truly come alive.  The music is also thrilling and captivating matching the tone and vibes of the series knowing when to hit certain instruments at the right scenes. With the perfect intros and outros.
One Punch Man is a wonderful thriller comedy anime. It is light hearted and thats all there is to it. Nothing really deep or meaningful, nothing that will make you question your existence or anything like that. So for some they might get a bit bored  with the comedy and for others they might have the same reactions as if they are watching it for the first time.",8,WazThatTL

                I really wanted to love One Punch Man, and it was a promising show at first. I think the concept is hilarious: a hero so strong that he makes any villain look like a joke. There are two main problems here, though. One, the action. It is a superhero action anime, which means a lot of fighting. What I consider to be the most important in an action anime is both animation and tension. The animation is good, but there's no tension. I can't bring myself to care about the action because I know how it'll end: Saitama will win, like always. If the show
                  stuck to more comedy (or even more drama), it would fare better. That's the second problem though, which is the comedy. The show relies on one main joke: he can beat anyone with one punch, and it bores him. This was really funny at first, but it wears on you. Why couldn't we get more episodes like the first few, where more jokes were on the line? Why can't we get more overly dramatic villains? Why can't we get more corny villain and hero backstories? This show is already ungrounded, and they should've been looser with it.",5,TheOnlyTransWeeb

                I just got into anime recently, and this was one of the first ones I watched, so my review may be slightly biased.
I really enjoyed the show. One Punch Man - the show- never takes itself too seriously and that helps it excel. One Punch Man - the person - is an awesome character, who just seems to draw people towards himself.
Mumen Rider is also a great character. He tries his best, despite his lack of powers, and survives the attacks of many incredibly strong opponents. 
One more thing, I like Saitama's dub voice actor. He doesn't sound heroic or like a normal anime protagonists
                  , he just sounds like a regular person.
I really enjoyed the show - I would probably name it in my top 10, at least - and am hopefully waiting for a third season of the show.",9,DamienisCool

                One of the first anime i’ve watched so my opinions might be fogged with nostalgia goggles. (why i rated 8 overall lol)
THE INTRO!!! when i hear the opm s1 intro I automatically get hyped, i don’t even listen to heavy metal-esque music but i can appreciate this intro. The art style is so unique and when I see the way the animation moves (especially during the fight scenes) i just really get excited. 
The characters!!! I love, especially when the premise of the show’s superheroes is surrounded around development to become a better ranked hero and we are given a main character who does is
                  just so....
most shows center around the development of 1 character and the characters around them helping them to improve. this one is not like that and it is extremely refreshing. 
This is a show you want to binge. I like the idea of the superhero association and the ranking of the heroes it adds another layer to the show which was fun.
I also really love all the bad guys. they all had some personality and weren’t all just copies of one another.
Would highly recommend and is definitely a staple anime for any anime lover",8,Barelyink

A simple story which is a bit silly with the MC Saitama able to end a fight with a single punch and is therefore looking for a worthy opponent to give him a challenge there is also quite a bit of humor which makes this a fun show.
Art 8/10
The art style here perfectly fits the world it exists in Saitama is a bald guy that doesn’t look spectacular but that’s just how his character is designed to be and the way the destruction is drawn is excellent.
Sound 8/10The OP perfectly fits the show we also get some decent sound and the voice acting works.
Characters 8/10
The characters approach the show with a great deal of humor many of the villains are overconfident and expect to overcome Saitama before getting the shock of their lives when they are defeated this same formula exists throughout and would get boring in most shows but really works here.

A fun entertaining show which doesn’t take itself too seriously.

I honestly really liked it especially the comedy the only issue i had was the fact that the main character was gonna win all the time but overall i really liked it due to the characters, art style, and the comedy. I really liked the characters except the blue haired jolly rancher i didn't like him what so ever, but i liked characters like genos, genos had a great art style and he was funny as well but the funniest had to be saitama even tho he barely reacted he acted extremely funny ^-^ The story wasn't really good though..... that was my issue i

                Dumb action series are dime a dozen in the anime world. However, most of them try their darn hardest to tell a compelling story that just comes off as pathetic, with attempts to create groundbreaking characters that just appear to be one-dimensional stereotypes by closer inspection. Needless to say, One Punch Man is a rare addition to the genre. Its a series so self-aware, that it pretty much admits its stupid. And it indulges in it.
I’ve got to admit I’ve never been this hyped before for an action anime since JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure (granted, that was a long time ago and my feelings on that
                  trainwreck of a franchise has shifted). The series itself is based on one bald chap’s ability to blow monsters into smithereens with just one punch and all the over the top characters he meets throughout the show’s runtime. The show itself mainly consists of Cape Baldy here facing off against different threats along with other superheroes from a Justice League ripoff known as “The Hero Association.” Throughout the show, the focus sometimes switches from derpfaced baldy to other characters and their own obstacles they have to overcome. From a storytelling perspective, it contains little to no substance but nevertheless, it does a good job relaying its underlying message of how to “always try your best to become the hero you want” with its interesting mix of monster battles and comedy. The humor itself is to me, the highlight of this anime. While it doesn’t work all the time, when it does work I’m left rolling on the floor in fits of laughter. It pretty much picks apart tropes from the shonen and superhero genres and makes fun of them. This could range from Caped Baldy being annoyed by Genos’s long-winded exposition about his backstory (a riff on tragic backstories of various shonen side characters) to the entire idea of a superhero getting so bored of being overpowered that he starts having dreams of being a weakling (a satirical approach to the overpowered shonen protagonist cliche).
There are a plethora of characters within the series, but the main reason to watch it is for Saitama, whom I’ve been referring to as Caped Baldy or whatnot so far. Saitama is probably one of the more unique overpowered anime characters I’ve seen in a while; unlike most “Gary-Stu” archetypes, he is constantly distraught by how powerful he really is, and his comedic facial expressions and attempts to humor his enemies keep him likable and a bliss to watch onscreen. His boredom of having to watch his enemies explode upon just coming into contact with him is a running gag and a central part of the show’s comedy. Other characters include his sidekick Genos, an arrogant loli called Tornado, Mumen Rider who is a man so hell-bent on being heroic that he pretty much will accept a bloody punch to his face from a godlike being, and so much more. The problem here is that none of the side characters really feel developed and most are left forgotten without any screentime to display their powers or even have any sort of development. Instead, the show just throws any sense of their development to short OVA segments, which still don’t do them enough justice. To add insult to injury, the anime introduces more characters to the mix later on and you could forget most of them because they have no role to play in the ensuing plot. Until a second season comes along, which I hope it does…
The animation… my goodness. You cannot do a review of One Punch Man without mentioning the animation, it would just be so unfair. Gorgeous, fluid, and creative; the animation in this show is one of a kind I have to say, with the pretty colors here being more than enough to drive the average individual into full-on hype mode. The fight scenes look fantastic with incredibly fluid movements and bombastic effects to emphasize each character’s signature move. I mean goodness gracious me, the first episode tops pretty much every anime I’ve seen this year from a technical standpoint and the best part is, the show’s animation gets better with each episode. Director Shingo Natsume did a magnificent job on Space Dandy and his talent shows. Let’s not forget that various talented animators from Studio Bones also worked on this show; no wonder it turned out so good. Oh and kudos to Madhouse once again for crafting yet another well-animated work. With this, and the likes of Parasyte and Hunter x Hunter under their belt, so wonder people give them so much praise (though, sadly, its all downhill from here). You will be awestruck by the animation, trust me.
The soundtrack also deserves a mention. I was surprised to hear that it was not Sawano Hiroyuki who composed the music because it sounds so much like his other works. Instead, Makoto Miyazaki here does a fantastic job in the sound department despite his previous involvement being only in shows like Dragon Crisis and Triage X. It’s kind of uncanny really, a composer who’s most notable for composing music for ecchi centric shows now churns out some of the best action anime has to offer. Great stuff.
People wanting a good overarching storyline with deep thematic exploration and well-developed characters should stay away from this. You’ll find very little of substance in this show. But if all you want is some great comedic moments, a hilarious main character, high octane action with some of the best animations this medium has to offer, then it might just be the show for you. I admit that it gets stale at a few points but when this show delivers, it truly does deliver. It won’t be for everybody but those who enjoy its wacky characters and over the top battles will be in for a treat. It doesn’t take itself seriously at all and just admits that it wants its viewers to have a jolly fun time. And I for one enjoyed this show even at its lowest moments.
So see ya later Baldy. Hope to see you and the crew once again when season two comes along with a bang.",7,Runasius

                One Punch Man is an excellent anime that brilliantly satirizes the shonen genre. With jokes poking fun at traditional anime tropes, endlessly fun characters, and some of the most beautiful fight animation in recent memory, One Punch Man has an incredible number of strengths. Instead of following a traditional shonen formula, One Punch man instead starts its hero as the most powerful individual in the world, and instead of overcoming challenging opponents and improving himself, he instead searches for meaning in a world that he has grown bored with. While certainly a unique twist on a thoroughly explored genre, One Punch Man is further improved
                  by the strength of its jokes, and its jaw-dropping animation, which never fails to impress. However, its strengths aside, there does seem to be a distinct lack of progression from one episode to another, with minor problems arising and quickly being solved as only a few story threads really see any development across the first season. Even so, there are some surprisingly emotional scenes in a generally comedic show, and the entire season carries so much energy and fun that it’s hard to find oneself unhappy with any episode.",9,DucklingPayday
