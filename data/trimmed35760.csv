                [Spoiler Warning]
Coming into Attack on Titan season 3 I was slightly nervous because I heard that this season was going to be more focused on Human vs Human, but by the second episode all my doubts had been relieved and thought It was the greatest shit ever.
Visuals and Animation - 10+
Out of nowhere Studio Wit upped the quality of the production values to a point I didn’t was possible in a TV anime. The Levi vs Kenny Squad sequence in episode 2  had some of the best Sakuga and animation I had ever seen All of anime, let alone TV anime. The amount of
                  shit going on in that scene literally just made my brain go like, “what the fuck that just happened.” Not only did the animation improve but also the art quality improved. In some scenes I was just in awe of how Wit Studio crafted the world of attack on titan so beautifully. 
The only thing I had a slight issue with was some of the CGI cuts. The rod titan was done pretty well but some CGI cuts were not pretty. I Also liked how they designed the crystal basement, thought it looked nice.
Sound & Music -10+
Hiroyuki Sawano, the man, the myth, the legend. This dude has composed almost  everyone of my favorite soundtracks and is always consistent. Some uneducated people might say all his work is too similar, but guess what? Who tf cares if it is similar all his music amazing and on top of that Attack on titan has in my opinion the best soundtrack in anime EVER. PERIOD. Everyone song in attack on titan sets the mood and tone perfectly and can strike a range of emotions, whether it be sad,inspiring,hype,heartwarming,scary, or nervous every emotions can be felt. Also the last scene when they played the scouts theme and Erwin was getting the scouts and the people hype was fucking heart pounding and gave me goosebumps.
Not only is the soundtrack good but the voice acting and sound effects are excellent as well. Dub and Sub both do a great job.
Characters - 9
Eren- had some pretty good development learning that he is not special and developed some chemistry with historia and became overall more mature, only issue I had was he sometimes got a little over dramatic and the stretch of episodes where he wanted to be eaten and was called constantly crying got a little old. Though even did come up clutch with that crystallization power and was badass when he through the barrels in rod titans mouth
Levi- We get some much needed depth on Levi’s backstory and see how his mom died and was a prostitute, how he lived with Kenny and when Kenny died how he really showed sadness that his father figure died. Also we get to see how fucking badass he is taking out every mf in his path. He went off against Kenny Squad twice and even injured Kenny. But that chase sequence was something else and just shows us how super human Levi is. Also the scene at the end where he is threatening to break Erwin’s legs so he can’t go on the mission shows how much he cares for Erwin and doesn’t want to see his friend dead, but at the same time when Erwin reveals that he values going on the mission to retake Wall Maria more than humanities victory Levi has to respect Erwin’s dream and let him continue. Also we see how Levi has to mentor the new Levi squad - Connie, Eren, Mikasa, Jean, Sasha, and Armin, to kill other humans and hardens them as shown when the new recruits see that there faces have changed. 
Historia - she gets a lot of development in this season, first we see her backstory how her mom was rod reiss’ mistress and didn’t care for her in the slightest. We also see her develop a relationship with Freda, who she remembers when rod shows her the erased memories through his magic bloodline power. Historia for the first half of the season is manipulated by rod who wants her to become a titan so he can get off on his God fantasy. Historia who is blinded by the memory of Freda blindly follows and at the last second changes her mind and breaks the syringe and flips Rod. This a huge development because historia is finally taking control of her own destiny and doing what she feels is right. When historia was made queen I thought it was going to be weird but AOT pulled it off and Historia gets her huge payoff when she cuts ties with Rod completely by cutting the last piece of him, thus ending his life and breaking historia completely free of her past. Also Historia gets closer with eren and Mikasa catches wind of this in episode eleven when she gives Eren the Death Stare.
Erwin - Uh oh, the Erwin death flags are high after episode twelve, with Levi showing concern for his safety on the mission to retake Wall Maria. Moving on, Erwin starts of this arc being arrested for murder he didn’t commit and having dramatic conversations with pixus and Nile.
He then comes up with a badass plan to fake a titan invasion and turns the table on the aristocratics running the government, who panic and want to quarantine Wall rose. This doesn’t sit well with pixus or Nile so they overthrow the government and head for eren. We also see Erwin’s backstory and how his father was killed because he found out too much about the world and that drives Erwin to uncover the truth of the titans and the world. Finally, Erwin gets the send off he deserves rallying the crowd and the soldiers. 
Mikasa- she doesn’t really get that much focus into her character but does have some pretty cool fight scenes but we do see her mood improve when eren goes back to his normal scrappy self when he fights jean.
Armin- in ep 2 armin gets his first human kill and gets emotional about it, he starts to show maturity and is more useful to the scouts also he cross dresses and gets felt up which was weird, reminds Eren about dream to go she the sea
Jean, Connie, and Sasha - we get see just how More mature they become when in the first battle vs Kenny squad they are indecisive and nervous and then in the second fight they just straight up murder people from the Kenny squad. When I saw my boy Jean slice that dudes neck and Connie also kill someone I was like “fuck they really out here killing people.” Also that scene when they are hype for the send off was pretty funny
Kenny - personality was super unique and he was a really cool character his fights with Levi were pretty hype and the whole gunman style of him in his squad was really dope. His death was pretty sad and the story of how he came to live with Levi was well done only issue I have with him is he died before his character was completely fleshed out.
Plot - 9.5 
Finally the PLOT! I appreciated the change in direction and commitment to focusing on character development rather than Titans. Although I did think the bloodline power thing was sorta whack the story was overall good. All though I am pissed that series is taking a break because I was hype to see them retake Wall Maria but whatever.",10
"
                Other than the male x male shipping, I am not finding many reasons to like this show anymore.
Half of the season is practically a collection of cliche action scenes. People teleport from the sky to save the day, others swing in the sky with spider-man gears, evil people sit on the face of someone just to prove that they indeed evil, Levi declares he is an insane badass by committing an act that distantly resembles the twisting of an arm. So fucked up! I am scared, literally how can man be this insane. Please, no, not the arm. 
The other half is practically a parody
                  of politics except the narrative itself doesn't recognize this lameness as a parody. People with might and power declare a thing, but another thing happens -- much like with the teleporting nakama in the action side -- other big guys teleport whenever important decisions are supposed to be made. Essentially every part of the politics is so one-dimensional it hurts and serves as an excuse to create more bullshit to fill the story with. These vary from random kidnapping incidents to people thinking one of their nakama dies if they don't hurry up. I am not sure how exactly am I supposed to be fooled by this when it is clear plot-armors in the series are thicker than the walls itself.
The best part of this show are the supposedly evil people and ""our"" enemies. Whenever our main squad gets called subhumen or pseudo-soldiers by them, I agree whole-heartedly. The opposing party did nothing wrong when looking down on our plebeian children at arms. Which this show really is all about. Some kids acting like they matter, fighting against titans or being titans or hiding from titans behind walls made of titans. At least the first season was fun to watch because it was a complete disaster and so overboard idiotic. This isn't even ironically fun anymore. More meaningless events one after another.
This season doesn't achieve anything. It's just Eren being chained half the time + farming, characters pondering over some action for half an episode each episode just to see the thing itself never happening. It's all false tension, all words no reward, no payout. Boring substance that is repetition of the same over and over while the fallacy that something might actually happen being there to fool those who are still buying this. Oh no, titan appears for the 700th millionth time, what a shock, I wonder which one of the two things that ever happen when a titan appear, happens this time around. Literally can't wait for the next cour.",2
"
                In a desolate world where corruption, power, and control rules all, Attack on Titan feels like a story that goes far deeper than just survival. As someone who has been following the series for several years, this franchise has really made a reputation. I’m not even talking about the commercial sales revenue or fan base. I’m talking about how this show evolved from a war between Humans and Titans.
After only a year, Attack on Titan made its grand return. Given the popularity of the franchise, this was inevitable but the big surprise was how soon it got announced. The first season ran for 2-cour in
                  2013 while the second season ran for only a single cour in Spring 2017. Yet, here we are with a third season after just one year. As a fan myself, I’m more than pleased to say that the third season continues to live up to its household name. It’s a franchise that truly deserves its acclaim.
Watching the third season will make fans quickly realize the change of mood in the very beginning. In fact, this season may not be what you are used to and will take some time to adapt with. The lack of Titans is evident from the first few episodes. Attack on Titan has been praised in the past before for its great action. Not only does the production quality and rhythm enhance the experience, the show itself always managed to capture the momentum of every battle. Here we are in third season and it takes a step back with the fighting between Titans and humanity. Rather, we have humanity dealing with its own problems - internal issues and political conflicts along with deep secrets that runs in the veins of key characters.
For a long time, we’ve seen the political conflicts inside the walls and government. Coming into the third season had me wondering how much we take a dive into exploring that side. And to my pleasant surprise, this season made a clear point that Titans are not the only enemies in their world. In fact, humans are also part of the problem and our main characters have to find a way to deal with it. For instance, Levi’s Squad faces off against adversaries that challenges them to life-and-death scenarios. Levi also faces a dangerous individual from his past, a man named Kenny. You may have heard him screaming in the promotional video but that scream isn’t just a battle cry. It’s the realization that he has to deal with his own personal demon. It’s not just him either but the realization of actually having to kill humans will test the mental limits of our characters. 
As in all of the Attack on Titan seasons so far, we take a look at background storytelling for some of the important characters. From this season, we take a look at Historia, Kenny, Keith, and even a bit of Eren’s mother, Carla. The key selling point is how these characters' stories connect with the overall plot. It’s imperative that viewers understand them as these stories reveal characters’ motivations and how their actions influences the present. To me, I think Attack on Titan always managed to capture a viewers’ attention through its characterization. The creator wants the audience to understand these characters by both telling and showing. It’s accomplished with important dialogues and actions motivated by a clear set of goals. I can’t really talk exactly the precise details as it would be spoilers but the big picture to realize here is why these characters are created. Attack on Titan Season 3 also made me understand why characters are motivated to do certain things and is an accomplishment not to be overlooked. The amount of psychology and emotions makes the story impactful too even for newer characters like Kenny. In terms of plot elements, the show continues to heighten the mystery. Attack on Titan has been known to create a feeling of suspense and there’s no doubt this season will surprise you.
In the present, main protagonist Eren finds himself in more trouble than just a death sentence. I would say this season made him feel less relevant at first until you realize what’s at stake. Eren’s connection to the past is one of the key mysteries in the show that probably had fans formulate theories all the way back in 2013. Here we are 5 years later and some of that mystery has answers. In the meantime, characters such as Erwin and Pyxis also play important roles with consequences. The plot evolves to become much more complicated than just a war against Titans. It becomes an internal war of complex ideologies. There’s also many revelations that shows how certain characters have connections with each other. And to add on to the cherry on top, we do still get fighting segments for you action junkies.
Season 3 takes a different approach this time but retains its ability to tell a memorable story. It managed to hook me in the beginning once realizing how important character roles are. Through its characterization, it showed me that the show doesn’t need fancy action and cinematics to make a well-polished anime. Sure, that part isn’t entirely absent but is limited compared to the previous seasons. Whether that’s an appeal will be for you to judge. Just do realize that Attack on Titan doesn’t always need people drawing out their blades and sticking it into Titans’ necks.",8

                *Minimum Spoiler Review*
TL;DR: If every weird conspiracy theory you had for SnK suddenly started becoming true... Well that's this season of SnK for you. From Titans dying like Titanic to Internal Gov'ts crashing like US Stock exchange on day two, this first cour of SnK will leave you screaming... KENNEEYYYYYYY! 
If you didn't watch S1 & S2, don't even bother reading or watching this anime.  
[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]
""You Levi. You grown any yet"" - Kenny Ackerman
This season of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan should really be called Attack on Internal Government. From military coups
                  to Historia becoming a waifu boo and Eren slapping himself to stop being Eren, this season definitely stands out from all the previous seasons... good or bad? Let's find out. What originally was supposed to be a 2-cour anime by Wit Studio, they throw another curveball towards fans by making it 1-cour due to budget & work constraints. That's alright since the anime delivers through their concise story adaptation, developed secondary characters, great non-hype music and as always stellar art & animation style. However, after finishing watching it, it will always leave you feeling empty as this season was less substance but more action, overall.  
""Who decides... Who will you trust?"" Erwin Smith
From the story stand point, director Araki & Koizuka did a phenomenal job taking some of the most boring drawn out manga arcs and presenting them in a different order to retell the author's story. Though S3 seems like it starts out of nowhere as no continuation is felt from previous season, you are immediately thrown into the internal world of life inside the wall with high paced action of people fighting people using ODMG but instead of swords vs swords we now have swords vs GUNS. Great job hooking puzzled viewers in and over the course of this anime we get to learn the real truth behind how politics is actually governed inside the wall. From who's pulling the strings, history of royal blood and finally the truth behind the man Eren's father really was. The best takeaway would be wondering, who really is the hero or rather who is actually doing what's morally right as shown through juxtaposing the childish views characters once had of this world vs adult views now they have chosen to accept. Who really thinks for the people and who are just selfish power hungry trash. The manga arc was boring but the director paced the story well for viewers to bite through it as well as some flashback stories of two key characters in this anime really solidifies Erwin's purpose of proving his father's hypothesis. 
""The person that I killed... I bet they were a nice person. Someone that was much more human than I am..."" - Armin Arlert
The main reason this anime gets praise this season is because we learn a lot of the history behind characters who we were somewhat curious about. This anime is no longer about Eren but more about the people inside the wall vs the beings outside the wall. From focusing on Historia's growth to Levi's tragic past and shedding light on the Ackerman Family & Reiss Family line, we get a sense of how the chess pieces are moving or have been moving all throughout history for mankind to come to this sort of standpoint. The anime also explores the change in psyche soldiers like Armin, Sasha, & Jean go through as they now have to cope with killing humans not just titans, a huge taboo. The beatdown lecture Levi tells them about we kill those who will harm us as self-defence & to protect our close ones parallels with IRL military soldiers and how they are trained to kill ""units"" not people. Because if you humanize your enemy, you will have hesitation vs treating them like ""beasts"". That's one interesting take-way from this season. Also huge shoutout to characters like Kenny & Hange, keeping the anime fresh with their torture techniques. Not to mention, the seiyuus for this season who were able to tell the story more through the anguish in their voice. Huge kudos to them. 
""I never said who was right or wrong. I don't even know myself."" - Levi 
Aside from the somewhat linear story arc & developed secondary characters, time after time, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. This season they nailed it as well. Every panel was hand-drawn really well. The action sequences flowed really well. We harp the studio for taking forever releasing the anime but atleast they never flake on us on quality. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. What stood out most though, was the opening of the anime. We are so accustomed to hype opening songs such as Feuerroter Pfeil and Bogen & Die Flügel der Freiheit by REVO of Linked Horizon that when a slow melodious anti-hype casual song as Red Swan by X Japan came to be opening song fans were lost and confused. This wasn't the SnK they knew and came to love. However, it grows with time and you get why that opening song was used instead of hype songs as this season wasn't about humans vs titans but more humans vs humans. This was what the directors wanted to drive home and by using opening song as this he set the battlefield for just that. So great foresight from their part. 
""Go on and torture me already. That's all I did with this blood-stained hands of mine"" - Djel Sannes
Overall, SnK S3 wasn't that bad of an anime. Is it as hype & story packed as previous seasons? Not really but given the manga arc the directors were working with, they did a pretty good job. By following not the path the mangaka, Isayama,  had originally planned out to this new pacing, it served justice to the anime viewers. Though the studio will take a break after 1-cour and continue part 2 from Spring (hopefully) it will be worth it to not read ahead and spoil ourselves in my opinion. Attack on Titan has come to terms to know what their recipe for success is and that's minimizing Eren's wailing and maximizing Erwin's madness. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with their purpose tied back to the beginning. Definitely looking forward to the next season or second part as that will be real jaw-dropping moment for most fans out there who has yet to spoil themselves. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in the first and second season, might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. The anime is building up to their denouement so why hop off the train now. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao.
P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",8
"
                This anime was my first show (when I realized what exactly is anime) and I will be honest: (about season 3).
OP intro 8/10- I did not expect anything like this but... but you know? it touched my soul and it more looks like Attack on slice of life not TITAN :D.
Story 9/10- unexpectedly moments and it will be interesting what will happen next? I know and I/we saw that the author somehow removed some backstories like whats wrong with Eren's titan form? and other thinks but I am satisfied with everything atm.
Art 9/10- in the previous seasons was much better but it does not interfere
                  watching.... I like it anyway.
Sound 9/10- at this moment no new soundtracks, but sounds from guns/swords/ambiance is cool I liked, and I hope Sawano Hiroyuki will bring us some new masterpiece osts/soundtracks in future episodes.
Character 10/10- almost all were behaving like IRL people there's no exaggeration, this is just as I see it.
Enjoyment 10/10- ten by ten means ADDICTION when episode comes out prepare yourself! (meals,drinks).
Overall 10/10- My masterpiece always will be outstanding I hope in the future it will not change to disappointment.",10
"
                After a little bit more than a year of wait fan favorite Attack on Titan is back with it's 3rd season and as always we are eager to see what's in store for us this time.
Story 10/10
It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in
                  love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.
Art 9/10
Animation 10/10
As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10.
Animation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. It's almost flawless 6 episodes in. That levi ODM action sequence is some of the best animation i have seen in anime. Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. It was incredible! While i was watching levi maneuvering trough the city i felt like i was the part of the scene. Levi grappling on the bar and pulling himself towards it made me feel like i was pulled with him. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.
Sound 10/10 
I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.  
Characters 10/10
What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters.
This season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her ""Christa Lenz"" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a ""gambler"". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. The way she gathered the information about nick's murder is amazing. After all she is one of the most intelligent characters in this show. She is someone that does what she promises, and she did. She tortured the guy that tortured her friend but after that she shows her other side. She shows human compassion. She repeats how she's starting to feel sorry for them and kicks the table which showcases her frustation and that she actually doesn't like what she has to do. Yeah i know it's hard to believe :D she was always crazy lol. Her weird love for titans makes her character all more interesting and multidimensional. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her ""I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl"". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).
Enjoyment 10/10
I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.
Overall 10/10
It's just getting better and better and hopfully there is more to come :) (P.S. my english is not perfect, hope you can understand :D)",10

                I know what you're thinking. This will be another cliche anime. It's just about killing these weird titans. It's just another ""edgy, shock value"" show with no depth. I'm here to tell you...this show is deeper than what it seems. I discovered this anime a year ago. One boring night i decided to give it a try and I binged the first 9 episodes. But why was I so in to it?
The surprises. The complexity. The mysteries. The emotions. The music. The animation/art. The lore. The tone. The maturity. The execution. The struggles. It all caught me off guard. What ended up happening was me
                  discovering my favorite series in any genre, and the first anime to ever make me pick up the manga (and my oh my will the end of Season 3 &amp; 4 be amazing, and I guarantee it will shoot it up to one of the all time great animes).
It's rare that I discover a show that is unpredictable. It's rare that I discover a show that actually makes me feel. I see criticisms about the story only being about killing titans...that the characters are shallow...that there's no substance...and I truly have to question if we're watching the same show. There are mysteries established from the very first scene. Mysteries that are paid off WONDERFULLY later in the story. There are characters that appear to only be background characters, who end up having an ENORMOUS impact on the story. There are themes and life lessons sprinkled throughout these absurd situations. While the critics only see fighting titans, I see the character development &amp; inner conflicts that arise during these situations. All of this is accomplished without forced humor, over-exaggerated artwork, and childish antics. Isayama successfully casts aside the usual tropes, even killing important characters (which actually makes me fear for the lives of other characters). He ignores the ""friendship will win"" tropes. The ""I'm passionate to beat him"" tropes. Actually, all these situations are presented just to give you the harsh reality that life doesn't always work out that way. This is an amazing experience, and as a manga reader, I promise y'all are in for a ride. Another special shoutout to the music, which is truly an amazing part of the show. 
This show gets a lot of haters. Understandably, like anything else, not everyone will like it. But there's plenty of people who hate on it just cause of its popularity. Or label the writer insane things because they didn't actually read the context of the story. DONT FALL FOR THEM. Be your own judge, notice every small detail of the show. If you're looking for something deep, mature, and refreshing...this show is for you.",9
"
                Season 2 was alright, but now it´s starting to become pretty goddamn average, and this is coming from someone who loved season 1, I even rewatched it several times... I feel that season 3 builds up to a climax but then just says fuck it, and goes back to where they began. It looks like a really bad version of Christopher Vogler´s narrative structure known as ""The Hero´s Journey"". I feel that the character development is weak as well, Historia just suddenly decides to switch sides without any ""real"" reason to do so. Yea sure, she has issues when it comes to a parental figures,
                  but how the fuck can someone be convinced to eat a person which was your former ally? The whole structure of the story feels weak, they force the characters ""tragic"" backgrounds on the audience without any chance to let us make up our own thoughts about them. I guess you could say, it´s too fleshed out. The creators leave no room for imagination imo...",5

                I'm so happy this turned out well. Season 3 is exactly what SnK should be. 
I didn't think things would necessarily turn out this way, either. In my humble opinion, SnK season TWO was a mess. During the first 6 episodes, the plot, pacing, etc. was completely off and it completely killed the show for me. I wrote a long review about it before but I don't wanna spend too much time talking about SnK s2 when this is about season 3. As season 2 approached the ending, however, it seemed the writing was coming back and I began to enjoy it like I enjoyed
                  season 1. 
Now the writing is in full force, and everything seems to shine. Where should I begin?
Essentially, all of our characters are set up at this point so there's no time wasted with long backstories or explanations. Whenever a backstory does come up, it's quick and does NOT subtract from the plot at all. During season 2 they kinda threw in flashbacks at random, even during critical, suspenseful moments, and it killed the immersion. If that was something you were worrying about -- you won't see that here. The story flows great. 
The characters are back and better than ever, too. During season 2 we really missed Levi in all his fighting greatness, but he really shares center stage this season. He's cool, collected, and intelligent -- even more than he was in season 1. He's back to fighting anything willing to stand in the way of his mission, and he's great at it. The show plays on the strengths and personalities of its characters and it really shows. Even though a lot of the season so far is centering around the side characters -- they don't disappoint at all. Not to mention everything is more impactful now that we've spent 2 seasons already with these people. I was looking forward to every moment their plans advanced or fell flat. Even the antagonists are cool. It's annoying to watch a show where the villains are dumb but the heroes always have everything figured out. You don't have to worry about that in SnK s3. There villains seem to be just as capable as the heroes, so you don't know what's going to happen. 
I'd say the story itself, so far, is much better than season 1 and season 2. While I enjoyed season 1 a lot, quite a few people complained about the lack of plot progression but I don't think that would be a fair complaint for season 3. During this season we've learned much more about the world, and we have a lot more factions/actors furthering their goals. The pacing is not too fast, and it's not too slow either. The story kept me on edge, with twists and turns that all flow together. I looked forward to each new episode even though the story kept me completely satisfied. What I mean by that is -- I was comfortable stopping at any episode, because I had been thoroughly entertained and I had gotten a lot with each episode. Some shows bore you with a dull episode and then a cliffhanger at the end -- not this one. 
There isn't too much that I can say because I'm only 5 episodes in but I'm just really enjoying myself and wanted to share. Lol. 
As for the art, it's as good as ever. I'm looking forward to seeing the animation during big battles that will come up in the future. 
The sound is good too, as it usually is. I feel like we haven't gotten too much of the OST yet so it's unfair to really judge it at this point. While I didn't care for the OP much at first, I have to admit it sounds much better using a quality headset in comparison to the bad speakers I played it on the first time. It isn't my favorite OP, but it's fine IMO. 
Overall, my ratings would go like this:
Story: 9
Art: 8
Sound: 7
Character: 9
Enjoyment: 10
Overall: 9
The reason why I handed out so many 9's is because it's so early in the season so I can't be SURE of any perfection yet, but I can guarantee that I've been enjoying the HECK out of it so far. On the course it's going, I'm sure to at least keep those ratings -- or maybe I'll think it's worth something higher. Hard to say.
RIP I had to reupload this review cause I ""didn't watch 6 episodes""  before",9
"
                As always this incredible anime has overcome any expectations that people have set for it. The first part of season 3 was amazing, well executed, the sped up pacing (compared to the manga), the visuals and the music were top notch.
Animation changed, since season 2 but it changed for the better, the action scenes look much more clear and crisper.
The overall tone of episode 12 to describe in one word was ""HYPE'.
I think the second cour of season 3 will leave a HUGE impact on anime only fans, as for us manga readers it'll be a dream come true.

                *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
In my opinion the second season of AOT was mediocre, the first one was mostly empty shock value and sensless action. This season has been boring me to death. It abandons everything form the last season and starts a new subplot that I just don't think is interesting.
Story: 
As I mentioned before the story has shifted into a new direction, now the government is bad and they want to kill Eren. He get's kidnapped for the third time and Historia becomes an edgy brat. It becomes so complicated that the show needs 3 flashbacks per episode just to explain what the hell
                  is going on. It went from a pretty good titans vs humans mistery story to a cliche civil war type story.
Characters: 
The characters are extremly weak, the writer had to add some random superficial character trait's just to make them seem less boring, take Levi for example I can't even consider him a character. He's more like a plot device that's only there to move the story foward by telling the other characters what they need to do, so to make him seem a little more like an actual character the autor aded that he likes cleaning, that's what lazy character writing looks like. And the other characters are the same, the only thing they have is 1 character trait and that's it. Also the development is flat, it's always just a monologue where they talk about stuff that doesn't add anything to the story, they try to stuff emotions down our throats to hide the unpolished story and character development just like Boku no hero academia for example.
Art and animation: 
The character art retains the same style but removes the thick black outlines that the character's had in the last season. It's good and polished in some places. Im not a big fan of their style but that's subjective. The backrounds however were horrible, they were mostly just a still image behind the characters. It lacked a sense of depth and just felt disconected from the characters. The images themselves were really plain and uncreative. All of it felt like the artist just didn't care, some backrounds had good art but had the same aforementioned problems.
The animation blew my mind, i don't understand why one of the most popular and mainstream shows of this entire medium has animation so bland that it made me burst out laughing in some scenes. In 11 episodes they had 2 scenes that are well animated. The rest are just people sitting or standing or some horrible slide shows. When they're using the 3d gear it just feels like they're flying in most scenes. Seriously, compared to the last season it feels like a different anime (in a bad way). Also the CG titan was just pathetic, they were changing all the time between 2d and 3d. It was inconsistent and looked really ugly. There were even lip syncing errors, I don't have a problem with these errors if I konw that the anime has a small budget but this is AOT, their's should be huge (thats what she said XD).
Overall:
All in all it felt lazy. They cut out some battle scenes form the manga and used a lot of cheap tricks to reduce the animation. The story is getting way to complicated for no reason. The character's are becoming even weaker because their develepment fails. I think it's a huge letdown copared to the second season (maybe they should have spent 4 years on this season too). 
The conclusion is: go watch HunterxHunter if you want an intresting show with good action, animation and an excellent story. I really don't get the hype around this train wreck.",2
"
                There are no spoilers in this review.
Season 3 truly shines in its ability to present us with some progress towards the answers we've waited for while fleshing out its cast and lore in an organic way. With its great handle on production quality, characterization and story development, I believe Season 3 elevates AoT from something that could be considered a decent popcorn-flick to something truly memorable in its execution.
Before I get into the story and characters, I think right off the bat this anime has to be praised for its STELLAR animation and soundtrack. I think WIT's work here rivals that of Ufotable's in some
                  areas, which is saying a lot. The action sequences are extremely well choreographed, and the animation is consistent, crisp and never really dips. The soundtrack also features some of Sawano's best. Don't get me wrong, as I'll discuss below the story and characters are definitely great, but the production value distinguishes Season 3 above most other shows in a fantastic way.
Now, the story of AoT has always been intriguing and interesting for the most part. The risk AoT took with Season 3, or the Uprising arc in general, was stepping back from the Titan killing to flesh out the questions we've all had for several arcs. Notice I say 'step back', not 'ignore'. Many people would try to convince you otherwise and say Season 3 only focuses on people, but the fact remains that Titans are still an integral part of this arc and actually have a more interesting purpose than just being killed on screen all the time. This arc perfectly balances three things: giving us answers to questions, fleshing out characters and keeping us engaged in an interesting story with a fantastic pace.
The first thing: giving us answers to questions. I will say some of the big questions we have about Titans are indeed answered in this arc, and (at least for me) they did not disappoint. I do admit there were times where really big reveals were just casually mentioned, which sometimes made it hard to recognize what is important and what isn't. But as you get deeper into the season (or if you decide to binge watch it in one sitting, which is what I did on my second rewatch with multiple people), you'll find the parts connect rather well. Of course, AoT is great at answering questions but also keeping us in suspense, so be warned: some questions will be answered, but other questions will rise up. 
In Seasons 1 and 2, I thought the characters in the show were...alright. Some were more interesting than others, but overall no one really stuck out. In particular, the intriguing story and world of Aot overshadowed the characters, and I really just watched for the suspense of what happened next in the plot development. I didn't have any interest in the characters or their development. Even though Season 2 made an attempt to flesh out some of the cast, I still found the season too short to make me care fully.
Season 3 has changed all that. Not only did it manage to add nuance and depth to characters that I thought would stay rather one-note, but it did it in the same time frame as Season 2 and to a larger effect. Characters I didn't even care for in Seasons 1 and 2 are now some of my favorites not just in this show, but perhaps among most shows in general. And not just people in the known cast, but new additions come up that have such life and presence that you can't forget them. It's no exaggeration when I say Season 3 introduces some of the best characters in AoT to date while bringing out the best in the rest of its cast.
Now, the pacing of AoT has been something discussed quite alot. I actually found the pacing of AoT's first two seasons pretty well-done already, but Season 3 completely revitalized the formula. Bouts of amazing action are balanced with nice, well-done sections of story development and characterization. Whether you're watching an amazingly animated fight sequence or a backstory about certain characters, you'll never feel like the content is something out-of-place. Each episode manages to pack compelling developments in character and story in perfect capacity. 
As for any flaws in this show, I'd say having watched the show weekly, the first few episodes were somewhat hard to follow because things are happening too fast; while there was stellar action in these episodes, the plot was somewhat loose and it felt like things were being rushed. However, as the show went on, that balance of fast-paced action with slower-paced story development kicked in, and everything started to flow nicely. Also, upon a binge rewatch everything fit quite nicely. And while some characters in this season get immense characterization and development, some (not a lot, but definitely some) still feel sort of dry and bland. However, this is just a small blemish on an otherwise perfect addition to the AoT anime. 
Overall, Season 3 might be my favorite season of AoT because it manages to deliver on the set up of the first two seasons. The characters have way more depth and nuance to them, the animation is through the roof and the show has shown us its not all about action and suspense, but also about telling us a great story. Although it's sad that AoT won't be coming back til April, as long as WIT can keep up this same level of quality in AoT's production value, I'm not complaining. Season 3 is a game changer for AoT, and I believe it marks the transition of AoT from a decent shounen to a fantastically intricate show.",10
"
                The third installment to the series excluding the OVAs and it continues getting better by the second. First let me state that AoT is what got me into the anime medium in the first place which may lead to my opinion being biased a little bit, but I probably won’t need to exaggerate on its quality for it already speaks for itself.
Second, this season was being criticized by many manga readers even before its release for it takes a different directive being mostly about the political situation within the walls and fights among humans themselves instead of against naked titans. This is honestly upsetting because
                  of how presumptuous it is and from what I’ve seen so far I can assure you that the thrill remains the same as you’re used to if not better along with the intriguing action any fan of the series would be pleased with.
As for the titans, even if there isn’t much titan action, because most of what seemed confusing in previous seasons is explained here we will have enough titans in the flashbacks all through. So, if you’ve seen unjustified hate befall this anime, don’t let this bum you out. Watch the PV and feast your eyes upon the action then give the first four, no, first two episodes a try and you will know what I mean.
Lastly before I start actually reviewing anything, I just want to state how glad I am to review one of my first favorite series as it airs since it means a lot to me and my career as an anime fan.
Now to the juicy part
Story:
We continue from where we left off last season. If you took my advice and watched the PV you would know this season mostly follows Levi and his squad and it starts from there. The scouts have fallen drastically and the political situation just keeps pressuring them more and more that it borderlines abusing them. And so, this season begins with how the scouts face such abuse and try to survive this cruel reality. However, this time their fight is inside the walls and their enemies are fellow human beings.
Despite being so early in the season, so much has already happened and the pace is just what I would expect of this series. Almost certainly this season will be 24 episodes, but as of yet MAL hasn’t updated it for some reason. In either case, we can expect it to have two arcs so if I find anything noteworthy in the second arc or a change of quality I will update this review.
I have mentioned a lot of hate which this anime has received justified by drawbacks found in the manga. However, the creator of AoT has already announced and I quote “Hopefully, now that season 3 is being made, I’ll have the chance to wipe away that regret and replace it with something I’m proud of.” So in case you were critical of certain weaknesses you have found in the manga, you have something to look forward to this season.
Art:
Since starting AoT, I have always been astonished by its art ever since the first episode when I got those goosebumps. Art is certainly a major strength of this series and I was afraid it would have fallen out of touch before starting this season. You can imagine my joy when I found out the art is still as beautiful as ever and has actually been polished a step further. The animation is breathtaking and the atmosphere is as bloody as ever with a tiny gap that lets in rays of happiness reflecting in the cast’s tears.
Here is a small fact about me, I am a gore maniac. Thus, seeing the bloodshed, cut skin and ripped out intestines is of outmost importance to my gore-loving self. Luckily enough, AoT doesn’t fall behind in its beautiful display of the aforementioned and, as a matter of fact, this season might be the best so far if you oddly enough share my same interests. Since the titans evaporate after being killed we don’t get a fair display of carnage, but this season seems to shine best in that regard. After so few episodes we have witnessed various colors of torture up to the number of episodes so far, this review is as of episode 6, which should be enough to please you if you are in it for the dark plot.
Sound:
The most notable thing here is that so far we didn’t have as many screams from Eren as we’ve had in previous seasons. Of course, that is to be expected given this is a more serious arc about political conflicts and struggle for power. The OST is befits the show with the OP and ED being best described as fun while the music during the show goes well with the action providing an ecstasy for any action fan.
Character development:
I don’t know about you, but Levi is one of my favorites in the series right after Hange and luckily all of the scouts have been getting an adequate amount of character development from the very beginning. We get to see them all from a new perspective because of the new enemy they are facing and how each of them is constantly changing be it for the better or the worse. I have to say, I’m enjoying Levi being a lead for this part and can affirm that if you like Levi, then you are in for a treat.
Enjoyment:
This series certainly isn’t for everyone, but if you are among the lucky ones who enjoyed the first two seasons, then shut your ears to all the hate you’ve been hearing and take my word for you will definitely enjoy this season just as much if not more than the previous ones. If you happen to be skeptical of the theme of politics hindering your dose of tantalizing action, I can tell you that the action is more than enough and more amazing than words can describe. The style we are used to is here and is polished up sharper than we have ever seen. I have been having a blast so far this season and I am sure any fan of AoT would say the same.",8
"
                As of the writing of this review, only the Uprising Arc has been shown. I have read the manga, and to be honest this arc was my least favorite, since it was very stretched out and kinda boring. But to my surprise, the anime is the exact opposite! WIT Studio has done an incredible job at translating this slow-paced arc into an amazing, interesting and incredible anime.
Story (8): Even though they sped up this arc, the beginning was still a bit slow. But many great anime suffer from the same problem, so you should never judge an entire anime just on the first few episodes.
                  The quality of the story became better and better after each episode, and it probably won't stop going into the next arc this season.
Art (8): Beautiful art, just as in the previous seasons. The CGI used in this season is actually a lot better than in the previous one (that colossal problem was horrible). But in this season it's quite alright.
Sound (9): Man, it has been said a lot, but Hiroyuki Sawano is like the Hans Zimmer of anime. Every single anime he worked on has a soundtrack beyond amazing. 
Although most people don't like the opening and say 'the ending and opening should be switched', I actually really like the opening. But yes, the ending is way better, but the opening is great too, don't be so butthurt.
Character (9): Levi and Mikasa are just as bad-ass as ever and still remain to be my favorite characters. Although now, we're introduced to Kenny the Ripper, someone who can compete with them on my favorite character list. I don't know why, but I'm just a sucker for bad-ass killing machines. 
And I guess Eren and the rest are there too...
Enjoyment (10): Even though the beginning was a bit slow, this arc is definetaly one of my favorties. From such a slow and boring manga arc to this incredible anime arc. Just goes to show how well WIT Studio is handling this series. 
Overall (10): There is not much to complain about this season. I enjoyed it all the way up until now and I will continue to enjoy it for the remaining episodes. I honestly can't wait to see the next arc animated!!",10
"
                There are few anime these years that are as bloody and brutal as Attack on Titan is, yet don’t use gore in an overly immature way. Although the series itself has generated much hate and criticism, I still believe it has more depth than most people give credit for. From the very first season, we get to see gruesome events of shock and horror, as well as the point of views of numerous soldiers who had to make sacrifices. It sends a message that shows humanity’s determination and resilience even in hopeless situations. It shows that, even though humans have the capacity for selfishness and
                  evil, we also have the ability to feel compassion and courage. AoT’s third season is not much different.  
Plot (7/10): From the very start of the show, we can see a change in the plot’s direction. Rather than a war against the titans, it’s now a fight amongst humans themselves. There are now traitors, people who desire power, and even corruption, that, along with numerous betrayals, it’s hard to know who to trust. There are also major changes made to the structure of the plot. It’s less about mindless violence and killing titans and more about building a relatively complex and mature story. From the backstory about Levi and his relation to Kenny to plot reveals concerning the Reiss family, this season has been an exciting watch. However, there IS a lot less action in this sequel, so your enjoyment may differ depending on what you liked about the previous seasons. If you enjoyed AOT solely for its action and didn’t care much about the story line, you most likely not enjoy this season. For the rest of the fanbase, this season is a must-watch to gain further knowledge about the true details behind the walls (unless you are a manga reader ofc).
By this time you may be wondering, if I’m praising AoT’s plot so much, why did I only give this category a 7? Well, as much as I want to deny it, the show isn’t completely devoid of flaws. For one, the first few episodes were painfully slow and was just mostly people talking about some political crap. The actual plot behind it was actually very interesting but I felt the producers made the dialogue too redundant. Another issue is that many scenes often felt like they were purposely dragged out, sometimes to bring out emotions and suspense, and sometimes for no reason at all. A lot of the episodes can be pretty much described in 3 sentences or less so it felt kind of boring at times. 
Animation (8/10): I do think season 1 featured much better animation but we got to see some cool animated fight scenes this season as well. A lot of the character movements do look awkward, so I can’t give this category a perfect score either. The Reiss Titan at the end was hilarious though.
Sound (9/10): Okay, I don’t care what people say, but I absolutely love the new op. It’s not intense like the others, but its got this beautiful and haunting and sort of sad melody to it. I also liked the amalee version of it a lot (I’ve listened to it like, 50 times), so I’m just gonna post it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCqV0wtUh1w . The voice acting is as awesome as always, though it’s pretty obvious with Hiroshi on the job.
Character (7/10): This season focused a lot on building Historia’s character as well as introducing a new character named Kenny, both of which it did a wonderful job at. Following episode 7, Historia becomes a much more believable character as she shows determination and confidence in her decisions. For someone who was known for being one of the weak and naive characters in the series, this is a nice change in her character. Kenny, a cold-hearted killer who is also (spoiler) Levi’s uncle, is another important character in the series. Through him, we get more information about both his and Levi’s past and the persecution of the Ackermans. Some may find him a boring and generic character at first but his characterization goes deeper than that! Due to his tough circumstances, he lived a dark past killing people and desiring power, thinking the only way to succeed is to be on top of someone. His character slowly changes for the better as he befriends Uri Reiss, and learned about compassion and forgiveness. He still to an extent, remained ruthless and cold but as the show progresses, is able to show genuine care for others. This adds to his personality, making him one of the more realistic and interesting characters of the show.
The rest of the characters are basically your typical AoT cast. Levi has more screen time in this season, showcasing his indifferent attitude and badassery. Eren I was sort of disappointed with since his character felt a bit recessive in this season. I liked his personality in the first season but now he’s more of an angsty teenager who is constantly whiny and complaining about who-knows-what. Erwin is as awesome as before, displaying true leadership characteristics and a very calm attitude. The rest of the cast, though, don’t really matter now as they did before. They are still there but now they feel more like plot devices since they do absolutely nothing the whole time. This isn’t a bad thing as the anime is now putting its focus on different characters, and it can’t do that and develop the rest of the cast at the same time, but I wish that Mikasa and Armin could have had more screen time.
Enjoyment (8/10): Overall, this season of Attack on Titan is pretty lit and if you are a fan you should definitely watch it. Although the execution is not always top-notch this show is still amazing and will definitely hit you in the feels and make your heart race with excitement.",7
"
                This is a preliminary review and I have no idea what I'm going to do with this review once the series ends (erase everything I wrote here and update it or just edit it?)
SnK has its pace sped up compared to the manga according to the author, and right well did they make this decision! Its pace is perfect - nothing is tedious; I couldn't tell that some parts of the manga for this current arc was written while its author was sick. Maybe one factor that did make it obvious the author was sick was the lack of filling plotholes once or twice. 
What
                  else is there to talk about season 3? If you're reading this, you've probably watched season 2 and 1, no? Well, Wit studios didn't do any worse than the previous seasons. 
So far SnK is entertaining me because lots of secrets about humanity is becoming revealed, the Scouts are making a huge impact than ever before in impacting human history, and solving the mystery of Eren's key is getting closer.
I never liked SnK's lack of love for its characters! Please have some pity for the characters! They are all dying like bugs! They are human beings - stop killing people. SnK keeps making a depressing atmosphere where there seems to be no hope for the future of humanity unless a brilliant French Revolution is instigated! Nothing about the French Revolution is positive, and it's just dark, just like this anime is.
Another thing I love about SnK, though, is that I can connect to the characters in that I, too, am also trapped behind walls, and desire a French Revolution for the future of humanity. The adrenaline this show gives me is amazing and it kept me going when I was working out!",10
"
                (This is a spoiler-free review.)
Season 1 of Attack on Titan didn't really impress me. The story seemed lacking, and the little story that it did tell did not make me optimistic. (I am not a reader of the manga.)
Season 2 was actually really good and, wow, season 3 is amazing. The story is fast paced, and the anime clearly has the budget and effort to back up its storytelling. It's thrilling around every corner. Every episode is solid, having either brilliantly animated action or interesting plot reveal. (Sometimes an episode has both.)
I'd say the dialogue is a little cringe-inducing and sometimes it relies on cheaper
                  techniques to move the plot along, but I find that these hardly detracted from enjoyment. (Eren's crying after being unchained was not a quality scene at all, but I don't mind it too much.)",9
"
                The first part of the third season of Attack on Titan capitalizes on themes and character motivations setup in season two while also setting up new themes and character motivations to lay the groundwork for events in the second part of the third season. Unlike the second part, not everything you see in these episodes will be extraordinary, but it is productive with its storytelling and still one of the most captivating seasons of anime I've seen. And, the show doesn’t even have much action this season.
Quick reminder: def my opinion, not an objective statement.
Also, quick note: If the opening didn't clue you in on
                  this, I am reviewing this part of the series with a reflective view following the second part of the third season. I will not be giving direct spoilers for either part, but I will hint at the moments I love at the very least. If you don’t want hints, don’t read.
Four of the characters get lots of attention in this season: Eren, Commander Erwin, Historia, and a new character Kenny. Eren and Historia change dramatically as they learn certain details and reflect upon their past experiences. Eren is redeemed and no longer that annoying protagonist that you seem to see in a lot of anime, and Historia is now her own person. Her connection with Ymir, which is established in season two, is used to great effect in driving her character progression and keeps well with the ongoing theme of living for yourself. For Commander Erwin and Kenny, we see their backstories, their motivations, and how they came to have those motivations. These two characters mean so much me in part because of the moment they inspire in the second part of the third season, which I will not explain because you need to see it for yourself.
This first part of the season is where we finally get lots of concrete details on the lore. A few small questions that you may have had about the government from the first and second season are answered while lots of new questions arise in their place. Many of those new questions remain unanswered in the third season about the timeline of the government during the events of the story in the first season, which can make you wonder ""Is there an answer?"" I personally do not find it a problem that there are unanswered questions and actually have fun thinking about what the potential answers could be. Those answers could also still come in the final season. Don't be too quick to assume that there's a plot hole ... because the writer is definitely trying to cover his bases with the world. Try to imagine what the answer could be. For me, that is one of the core appeals to Attack on Titan. Admittedly, it is a niche appeal, but the show is all the better for it in my eyes. As for the questions we did get answers for... my god. It completely fulfilled my expectations for the fantastical nature of the world and then some with mythological elements (I ain't spoiling stuff, so ask me directly if you want to know something that you might have missed in the show). And as always, there’s still more to know.
The soundtrack is phenomenal. It is so much better than the seasons that came before it (not counting the OP which does not at all match the tone of the show). Here are a couple examples that I liked.
1. At the end of the second episode the audience learns something about Historia's family that is definitely important, yet it isn't entirely clear how important it is and why. Then the symphony music cues in with slowly increasing volume to egg on our anticipation of the answer. You won't be able to resist watching the next episode lol.
2. That low volume and yet intense sound you hear once you see the cave for the first time (yes, there's a cave), it's one of those ""oh s***"" moments that gets you hyped for what's to come and the OST in that moment enhances and keeps the feeling alive inside you. It is so much more subtle than the in-your-face music from the first season, and it draws your attention to what's happening while keeping the hype! 
There are plenty more instances to mention, especially with the symphony music. It fits really well with the grand scale and mysterious elements of the show.
From the perspective of animation, the art is not outstanding a majority of the time. Excluding one sequence with Levi that is balls-to-the-wall with animation, you can tell the studio took some liberties with CG, far out shots, and moments when your attention is on the dialogue. But, that does not matter to me considering that there isn’t much action in this part of the series. There are other things to consider about the art. Facial expressions are killer, and I am still a fan of WIT studios’ shading technique when they want to emphasize the expressions. Backgrounds look good and a lot of emphasis is put on the making the environment look as natural as possible. And the eyes man, I love the detail they put into the eyes. Best irises in anime lol.
To close, I want to focus on Kenny's backstory, which is my main highlight of the first part for multiple reasons. One, I got a glimpse into the world prior to the events of the story and the underground of the capital city. Two, I got to see Kenny's character progression and how he established his motivation. Three, I got a glimpse into the royal family’s motivation and -- in the process -- discovered a new theme that resonated with me immensely and is called back on in the end of the third season. Four, it serves to set up one of the best moments in the series thus far with another theme that I resonate with immensely! That one backstory makes Kenny one of my favorite characters in the series. It is also one of my favorite episodes in the series even with all the amazing episodes in the second part. Be careful when you watch it for yourself though. Don't get too caught up in his relatives! That isn’t the most important part, I swear!
Thank you for reading! I put a lot more into this review than I tend to for others and hope you got something out of it. The third season of Attack on Titan cemented the show as my favorite without even reaching the conclusion lol. I really hope the final season is as good as it’s hyped up to be.
And for you AoT haters … don’t ask me about the maneuver gear or explosives in that last action sequence. Or Levi and Mikasa dodging bullets. I know it probably wouldn’t work that way, but does it even matter considering what is accomplished with the story? If you think something else is wrong that I missed I challenge you to run it by me. I am willing to bet it is not as much a problem as you may think.",10

                pee-ew stinky poo poo. this season was fucking bad. and i'm not saying this as a hater or anything this shit was BAAAD. // spoilers !!!!
I didn't review AOT S1 or S2 but I'll go over what I liked and didn't like about them to give you an idea of why this season was so disappointing. The premise that was set in season 1 was interesting yet very basic. Giant humanoid monsters force humanity behind walls for protection where they live out their lives until Big Boi and Armor Boi break what was a peaceful-ish lifestyle for our main characters. Characters are introduced whose goals
                  and motives are very obvious, wanting to kill the titans for what they've done. The first season was full of slick fight scenes with a killer soundtrack to back it up but the development of the story itself left much to be desired with the characters themselves being 1-D and developing nada. At the end of S1, we were left with the question ""what is in the basement"" and at the end of S3 (part 1) we have the answer ""now we'll find out"". What I don't like about AOT is that they do not develop the main storyline, because doing so would require making sense which S3 demonstrates is a tall task. 
So if they don't develop the main story, what do they do. Sidestories, sidestory after sidestory after sidestory which I wouldn't mind if only it was well done or made any sense. The first few episodes of S3 introduce Levi's uncle, Kenny, who took care of him from his early childhood but don't really go into any detail. The details of who he is, what he did and why he do, are sprinkled in throughout the entire season but didn't need to be done this way at all because it didn't add anything to the story. They pull of some twists which are meaningless. For example, Kenny is an Ackermann which means he is also somehow related to Mikasa. In his backstory, we learn that the Ackermanns and the Orientals (yes that's right) somehow betrayed the King and were cast into exile. Wow that sounds like an opportunity to really develop Mikasa as a character oh wait we did nothing with that oh. 
The majority of the season was dedicated to showing how Titan powers reside in a royal bloodline and they can be transferred through consuming each other. These powers are what enables Titans to make their hard armor and explains how the Walls of the city were made (but doesn't explain the beast titan, or armor boi or big boi which we never even talk about in this season). We learn that the current King is just a facade and the real King/Queen follows this bloodline which doesn't make a whole lot of sense because of the amazing other power you get from being part of the bloodline, wiping people's memories. With that kind of power, why did the family rule from the shadows? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Why didn't they use the power to help save humanity? Because the King's Will. That is the actual explanation. I understand that in a world where Titans exist it's not a far stretch to have more supernatural stuff but this doesn't add or explain the story. it's just a poor attempt of fixing plotholes that they made from following this route in the first place. And that's why I'm so disappointed with the story. It went from shallow filler (which I was used to and came to expect) to making any sense. Hopefully, in part 2 Eren came fix some of these plotholes with his hardening.
The art has stayed consistent through all 3 seasons but the fighting in this season was some of the least exciting. These fights carried no risk, we knew no one was going to die or even have any permanent injuries. The chase scene involving the squad going after Eren and Historia was probably the only 7 minutes of S3 that lives up to what you say from the first season. 
Something I didn't know they could mess up was the sound. The strings, the percussion, the swells of a melody that indicated some Titans were about to get fucked up are barely there. The backing soundtrack just felt like a watered-down version of what I loved in the previous seasons. I think a huge part of this is because there just aren't any moments were it's appropriate, nothing sad enough to warrant the Reluctant Heroes or epic enough for EMA. 
Now for undoubtedly the worst part of the series, the characters. 0 development still shallow as always but now they aren't even consistent. Eren has always been one of the most annoying characters, not developing at all, always just yelling. In S3, he does a lot of crying though. Crying over the things that he is not even responsible for and instead of taking it upon himself to own up for mistakes his father made. Except in the next episode he remembers his dad was a doctor so he probably did all those horrible things for a good cause and he's happy again. A great scene that did come out of all of this (although I don't think it was intended for this effect) is when Eren realizes how boring and pathetic he is. When he learns about how he got his Titan powers he realizes that without them he would literally be a nodody, not special in anyway at all, probably would have been killed by a Titan in S1. Coming to this conclusion, he begs for his life to end to atone for how boring of a character he is. 
I wouldn't say that I am a fan of AOT but I liked the first season and I enjoyed the second season enough to watch this one but nothing could have prepared me for how bad this was. In S2, the bomb that big boi and armor boi are Reiner and Bertie are just dropped so casually but we literally never even address it once in the 12 episodes. We get to see another clearer shot of beast titan and now we can say for sure that he is blonde. 2 seasons later we aren't any closer to uncovering the secrets of this world that didn't even need to exist. I'm just rehashing the same points by now but I'm just frustrated with how they dealt with an arc that added nothing to the overall story, setting and ""character development"". Overall, I would this was the worst season yet which in a way is a good thing because part 2 and season 4 could literally not go anywhere but up from here.",3
"
                Since it is a split cour, time to make a review. I really looked forward for this season of Shingeki no Kyojin. In the trailer, they showed us that Levi is the main focus of this arc. Then on Ep.1, they introduced us (with the best way possible) to Kenny, the ""main villain"" of this arc/season and the one who took care of Levi when he was a kid. The first 2 eps delivered the hype. At that point my rating is a 7/10. They showed what I came for. A Levi centered arc. 
Then the next few episodes the focus was shifting away from
                  Levi and instead shifting to Historia and the Reiss Clan. They are simply uninteresting and they bore the hell out of me. At that point I was already losing my hype. Then the rest of the season focuses on them and Kenny just dies because he got caught from a blast which is pretty anti-climatic IMHO. I wanted a Levi centered arc not this since that is what they hyped. The first 2 eps are really amazing but as the episodes pass by, the quality decreases. Rod Reiss was just a mediocre villain. Just plain uninteresting. The lack of exposure between the relationship of Levi and Kenny just disappointed me.
This season also has the least sense of danger on all 3 seasons. On the first 2 seasons, I can feel that anyone could die at some point. On this season, no. I know everyone was going to survive at the end like a typical shounen anime.
For the positives, I like the flashback abour Eren's dad (Ep.11), the first 2 eps (I know I am spamming this but they are really awesome) and Erwin's part on the season.
Overall a 3/10. Potential wasted.",3
"
                I went back and forth on what I should rate this anime and I think I actually gave it a little bit too much credit. Let me start by saying that this is the most overrated anime of all time. Season one was good, season 2 was ok, but season 3 was just...words can't even describe how bad it was. Because of all the hype I decided to watch Attack on Titan, after watching season 1 I really liked the show but it eventually started to feel like your average everyday anime. Mc has some awesome power, gets mad and exposes it to everyone, and
                  some basic side characters. I was really debating if I should continue watching Aot after the major disappointment that I felt in season 2 with the plot getting absolutely nowhere and barely any character development. I can't believe I sat through 12 more episodes of this mediocre anime. I would not recommend this anime and I don't think I will watch season 4. For that reason I give Attack on Titan a 5. (that's being generous)",5
"
                From the mysteries of the second season, now the third season takes the reins with political upheaval along with all those mysteries uncovered and still withstanding in the first and second seasons...with varying degrees of success.
Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 is a good continuation from the second season and how this season takes it's direction less from the Titans and more so in the government and the people inside the walls with a political upheaval in the mix of it all.
LA will say like LA said about the second season but Krista or Historia has ALOT of screentime in this season and all the more
                  for it with how much plot significance and how much of focal point Historia has at the anime at large with Eren tagging along, which oddly enough they have a small but impactful link with one another and this in turn makes them targets for the King, Eren for his Titan powers and Historia for other reasons with Kenny Ackerman on their tail. On talking about character development, the development for most of the characters are spread around sparsely to say the least with little interactions from the main cast to gauge us how or what the characters are feeling or change in personalities, small ones like Jean and his quandary of having to kill people not titans to Erwin's dilemma of the social structure and injustice of the people inside the walls and heck some characters LA wasn't expecting to get character development no matter how small. Historia and Eren getting the spotlight is a given but those little interactions help to say the least especially with such a huge ensemble cast. 
So with the political upheaval, comes into Historia significance of the plot and how this pertains to Eren and to be honest as daft as the plot sounds, it DOES makes sense how they are linked, no thanks to both Historia and Eren's past family failures and ambitions. Though the political upheaval is taken as expected in these kind of plotlines you know ""corrupted"" as per usual, it's more or less HOW they are overthrown with the main cast with their backs to the wall in how they turn everything around which is one of the more better executed moments in this season as anti-climactic and predictable as it was. 
With Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3, there are plot twists as per usual but more so there are SOME form of answers given, like the King and how the government works in a better or should LA say corrupted light, Historia's backstory and how this links with Eren and gives the barking, shouting main protagonist some new light to his character in the process especially with his hatred of Titans and how Historia utterly takes the spotlight once again with her involvement, not to mention how she later pertains to the plot and the changing social structure as a result of the overthrown government.
In terms of animation once again done by Wit Studio, the animation was consistent and very well detailed right down the awesome fight scenes as sparse as that was in this season with the lesser Titan killing and more human villains of this third season but nonetheless the choregraphy to the planning of the battles as well as the more insane things that occurs in this third season was beautifully and viscerally animated with the consistency to boot, Wit Studio did it again in this front at the very least.
The voice acting was great and expected with the returning and new characters in the mix with Kazuhiro Yamaji as Kenny as the gruff suave badass Kenny to once again Shiori Mikami flexing her range as Historia even more than ever in this season as well. Yui Ishikawa, Marina Inoue and Yuki Kaji gets decent coverage as their respective roles, though LA felt that Yui Ishikawa as Mikasa got lesser screentime, no thanks in part to Historia getting more focus but nonetheless. Overall voice work was expectedly good for a continuation. 
Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 1 was in LA's eyes the more human side of corruption in comparison to looking at the more Titan corruption of the second season, looking more into the societal injustice than the mysteries of the Titans, sure the third season part 1 does have it's mysteries it digs up and answering some, but even then the characters more than anything shows much more of a precedent to this time around and with that, the third season part 1 was a success in LA's eyes, Shingeki no Kyojin took it to another new direction, but was still focused and it executed itself quite well in this regard.
Now there is a second season...of this third season announced (you know much like how Shokugeki no Souma's San no Sara did with theirs), LA saying ""third season part 1"" being quite obvious to this fact, leaving the first part of the third season where the main cast are on their way to the elusive basement..and as much LA hates the entire ""splitting cours"", LA is more than graceful in saying that if Wit Studio need to the time to refine their work, or you know..rest then that's fine by LA, but LA expects the same standards or maybe even surpassing that for this Part 2.",9
"
                 Given the nature of today's media consumption, rarely does anything 'stick' unless constant updates are provided to keep out attention.  Wit Studio's faltering in releasing the second season of AoT has resulted in the series's current lack of attention, which is a shame because it's only gotten better since its first season.  
Story:
Our story continues in humanity's fight against the titans, bringing us back within the walls of Shingeki no Kyojin (or Attack on Titan, I just prefer the Japanese titles) where instead of a mass slaughter/operation to fight the brainless naked people, we're given character moments, backstories, lore dumps, a lot of exposition, more lore
                  dumps, dear god how many lore dumps are there?!
Harking back to the kind of tone that was established in Season 2, a lot of what Season 3 has to offer comes to expanding the cramped world of SNK outward by giving us an astronomical amount of lore and related content that gives a few answers and many, many questions which lead to said answers.  A lot of the focus this time is centered around Historia, who got a major upgrade from her role as the background 'cute girl' that she was established in way back in Season 1, expanding her role as a character and the significance she holds after the events in Season 2.  This, combined with a lot of retrospective moments that make the struggle of sustaining a population with limited space really helps set the alarming and desperate situation that the characters are in and gives a lot of motive as to why the Scouts give a damn to 'take back Wall Maria', as they've been saying for basically three seasons by this point.
While a nice (and beneficial) change of tone is good and all, the problem with the way this is presented is simply by how much of it there is.  Factors like explaining the royal family, who Historia is, facts about Eren's dad, the origin story of Eren's dad, introducing an entirely new character who serves as an extension of Levi, bringing back an old face that appeared for like three episodes in Season 1, the list can goes on and on.  This overload of information makes it extremely difficult to pace out correctly and ended up making the series disjointed and clunky in its presentation because all kinds of different information was being presented, especially in the latter half of the series where we get several episodes which were one-off episode backstories.  The information is good and helpful, but the place for them was certainly less than ideal.
There's also the issue of Wit Studio saying they're 'taking a break' and split the originally 2-cour season into season part one and two.  (J.C. Staff, don't you laugh, you're guilty of this too.  You too Diomedia.)  It's one of those emerging practices that I'm not a fan of.  Yes, studios need a break and a bigger time window so the animators can breathe a little bit, but the place that they ended on was such a big hype moment with a massive cliffhanger that it's infuriating as the audience to have to wait several seasons before it can be released.  Especially when the last few episodes of the 'season' just sort of meander without any real point to it since they can't go farther risking an unsatisfactory stopping point.  That's one of the major reasons you lost a lot of viewership and attention here in the west after all, Wit.
Overview:
+ Good tonal shift
+ Lots of worldbuilding and character moments
-  Too much of it was jam packed together
-  Ended right when things were getting fucking good.  (You're blueballin' us here.  And not in the good way.)
Characters:
On the note of characters, the theme with SNK seems to be ""Do everyone but the main characters"".  While Eren certainly didn't get the spotlight in Season 2 which was a nice breath of fresh air from his teenage vengeance boner, him being a more important part of Season 3 yet not really getting anything to himself aside from moments of reflection add, but don't do his character any favor.  He broods around so much that he does indeed seem he's growing, but does it so much that it kinda gets annoying.  A shame too considering a lot of his reflection does his character a lot of good.  I just wish it was done more subtly and wasn't so frequent.
Historia on the other hand gets so much attention that she might as well be the main character this time around.  The entire season is centered around her character and her family history, which ties into the overall lore of the series.  What we see is a dramatic growth in character that builds her from the meek and shy girl she was before to one worthy to pay heed to.  It's good growth that catalyzes a lot of organic action and motive, and was definitely one of the highlight moments of the season.
Unfortunately, much can't be said for the rest of the cast.  Levi gets his own mini area to himself, but it's not nearly as developed as Historia and feels sloppily made cause it's not HIS backstory; he's just part of it.  (That and the setting for it comes outta nowhere.  We were literally never told that there's an 'underground' before.)  Armin and Mikasa are even worse off.  They don't really do anything aside from move where the plot demands them be.  Even if they're pushed to the side, they're still protagonists, and should facilitate the plot in some way, but they don't.  The same could be said for any of the remaining scouts, where Jean just serves as a character foil to Eren and having a split relationship with Marco, and miscellaneous characters/cannon fodder who by this point you really shouldn't care about cause their impact quite literally lasts for 10 minutes at most.
Overview:
+ Historia's growth
+/- Eren's self reflection
-  Everyone else kinda meanders
Art:
It's been 5 years since the release of the first season, and Wit has drastically reduced the thickness of the black outline of the characters.  The art is essentially the same, but higher quality, with some very nice choice animation sequences that stand out amazingly.  The introduction of new areas also aid to make the world a lot prettier as their involvement expand the world and provide the animators something new to draw instead of fields and buildings.  
The usage of CGI is also pretty prevalent this time but doesn't stand out due to the series using it sparingly and only during wide or distance shots, which look amazing when they happen.  It's rare that I see CGI usage not bog down the show, so this is a case where I have to give Wit congratulations on a job well done.
Sound:
Like the tonal shift, the music we get is a lot more somber and isn't so high energy and firing at all cylinders like previous seasons.  ""Red Swan"" by X JAPAN and HYDE is more focused on the vocals and has a smoother sound to it.  Using a lot of piano and a lot less repetition like its OP predecessors, this song sticks out to me not only for that fact, but just how much it ties into the season with its themes of self reflection and perspective. 
Similarly, ""Akatsuki no Requiem"" by Linked Horizon is kinda like a less intense version of Season 2's 'Sasageyo', being more focused on having a smoother sound and sounding more like something you'd hear sung by a choir than a battle cry.  Again, it's one of those changes that I'm a fan of, expanding the potential of the series and the apparently complicated lore that it has.
Personal Enjoyment:
The 'Shonen' genre has had three ages up till this point.  The first age was the Big 3: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece dominating the space with HunterxHunter lagging behind with a somewhat smaller but strong base behind it.  The second age expanded with an explosion of popularity in the west: SAO and SNK being the forefront of that movement, both of which sitting mostly in memoriam but still have an existing following behind them.  Currently we sit in the third age with Black Clover and especially Boku no Hero Academia, but we're focusing mostly on the second age here.
Having followed the adaptation since the birth of the 'second age', I found Season 3 to be not as strong as Season 2 in terms of execution, and sort of as an equivalent to Season 1 if Season 1 focused more on trying to build the world instead of insane violence against both humans and titans alike.  It's still a positive change however, and gives the show a stronger footing in the overall story it's trying to present, even if the lore delivery was pretty messy getting towards the end.  Had the season not been split into two, I feel like it could've done a lot better overall since easy lead-ins would benefit the story more instead of NEEDING to end on a massive cliffhanger in order to keep people interested (which for the most part only angers your audience) and I would have more time to catch up instead of marathoning a fourth of the series in one sitting.  
If you want more SNK, watch it.  Honestly I'd vouch for this series to be seen by more people because it's good, but hardly anyone cares about it because the landscape of anime is extremely unforgiving due to the seasonal schedules and the consumer's need to consume things and quickly forget them once the season's over.  It's a shame that Wit only found their footing to easily release more episodes of the series three years after the hype had truly died down, but for what it's worth, it's much easier to get into the series without fanatics memeing the fuck out of it so you can actually sit down and enjoy the goddamn thing without interruptions.  It's nice, if not a bit tragic.",7
"
                 So, how the fuck is this the same anime as the one from season 1 ? It got from humans vs a sort of apocalypse, larger then life threats, or coping to deal with life issues, to piece of shit humans vs piece of shit humans. It is soo poorly fucking made, it makes Resident Evil and Game of Porns look like masterpieces.
Why the hell are the characters alot of the times over 9k on the retard level scale ? Why do they emo the shit out of some drama scenes, that don't absolutely relate or show any kind of lesson the characters have
                  learned from the past, or past experiences that help them cope with such issues ? You know what I'm talking about, BASIC FUCKING EVOLUTION. Or at least what every decent human being expects of anyone that has been through life, or through certain situations. The characters did not even evolve anymore, or at least stop evolving, it's worse, they devolved. 
Why do characters that were implemented greatly, suddenly lose their shit or start wondering about their purpose etc. whithout any apparent reason whatsoever ? 
Plot holes ? This show has a bigger plot hole than Uranus. And I swear, those fucking random Titan powers, or wait, they're not random at all, they're fricking there to fix the shit story and the fucking plot holes. At this point, it wouldn't be surprising, at least to me, if any or all blonde characters start growing their hair and go SS4 and over 9k all of a sudden. It's just made in such mockery and ridicule that I can't even...I've even started wandering, is there any story, or anything happening this season even worthy of attention ? It's just so bad and random, I have a feeling the next plot twist will be even worse or just undo everything that's been done until now.
Why didn't they continue where they left off in season 2, and suddenly just starting throwing in characters or killing characters no one remembers or even cares about ? This season was so stupid and redundant, they literally could have covered it all in 1 episode, or by lettting 1 new character do his thing. Such a waste of time...And, at least for us human beings, time is the most important resource available to us, so I think some people will be able to understand my frustration with this season.
In all honesty, I am so disappointed, angry, annoyed and the resentment and loathe I have for this season (which I've been expecting for quite some time now), I can't even express in words...Never expected the series to take such a huge fucking nose first cliff dive.",1
"
                 I love this show and always will so I am a bit biased but I feel most people can enjoy this show and this season. The action is always entertaining, music is always hype, animation is always amazing besides maybe a facial expression every now and then, same old characters that I love plus development for them and new ones, and I like that we are getting more knowledge about the world and titans finally plus some rebelling against the government stuff which is cool. It differs a bit from the manga so far as the creator wanted to change some things and if
                  you are a anime only and even have read the manga its still great and the changes don't take away from anything unless you want everything from the manga to be in the anime (which is never gonna happen for any anime really because of budget and just not being all that important really) but even if you are that nit picky its still a great show and to me its one of my favorites.",10
"
                Just as a heads up, I haven't read the manga, so I'm writing this review while only knowing what we've seen in the anime. So, I'm not the biggest fan of Attack on Titan. I can't deny that it's storytelling and visuals are remarkable, but it's never really been my thing. 
This season, that changed. Why it changed, I couldn't tell you, but something about this season really got me excited for the future of the story. This season is very much a Levi season. While the story still focused a bit on Eren and his backstory, really, season three of Attack on Titan was
                  centered around Levi. You'll get an episode on Levi's origins, and you'll also get to meet Kenny, someone that's tied deeply to Levi's past. I think this slight shift away from Eren helped rejuvenate my interest in the series.
However, this season will also give some long awaited answers to Eren's family, namely his father. Not only will you get backstory on how he met Eren's mother and what life was like for the two of them inside the walls, you'll learn who Eren's father was before he entered the walls. Not to mention, this season finally sets up what exactly is in the basement of the Jaeger house. Or this half of the season, I should say. 
Both Levi and Eren's history are very, very excited new pieces to the story as well as Historia's history. The overall pacing of this half of the season was done very well as the proper sections of story dropped when they should've while still having the proper down moments.
Of course, I have to brag on the visuals because they get better every season. A new Titan is introduced in this season, and the look of it is insanely cool. There are also brilliantly done environments that I love.
Attack on Titan still isn't entirely in my wheelhouse, but if it is for you, I think this season will impress you more than any others. The teaser for next year's content was very intriguing as well, so at the very least, my interest is still very much peaked for 2019. Here's to more!",8
"
                I was very disappointed by this season. I felt like season 2 was a set up for season 3 so I let it pass but now season 3 just feels like a set up for season 4. It was ridiculously slow and there was only one fight sign in the whole show that was good, the rest was just purely talking about about their feelings, their past and some plot development. 
This show has been hyped way beyond it's level and I think because of that I feel more disappointed. The characters are generic at this point, you can pick any shonen anime character at
                  this point and plug him in and you'll get the same result. there is no depth left.",6
"
                Story / Characters 8/10 - well, its 1:1 manga adaptation and the story only gets better as we move on. Its one of the very few currently airing series that I can watch without constant facepalms (like Steins Gate 0 or Boruto) and cant wait for the next episode even if I know exactly what will happen. 
Art / Animation 9/10 - well, not much to say here. Its joy to watch and one can pray other series (cough, DBS, cough) were looking THAT good.
Sound 7/10 - overall soundtrack is good and keep up with visual side, however openning is dull compared to amazing high
                  energy ones from 1st and 2nd season. It's a dark, brutal series with tons of fast paced action, not a slice of life.
Overall 8/10 - one of the best shounens in decades, which I can safely recommend everyone. Captivating plot, great characters, beautiful art - jsut watch it!",8
"
                Attack On Titan's third season is the most impressive instalment so far - a surprising merit considering it has the least amount of actual titans. AOT proves here that it does not need to rely heavily on its premise to deliver a compelling narrative. While the traumatic first eight episodes of Season 1 remain the best collection, Season 3 manages to mostly overcome the struggles of pacing that its prequels fall victim to - like so many shonen - and takes large steps forward in character development.
While the first episode of this season put me off with the sudden introduction of Kenny, his involvement is
                  so well executed that it's impossible to count it against the show. Political intrigue and the criminal underworld are not at all what one learns to expect from AOT, but the pacing and volume of exposition are carefully used to keep you guessing all the way through. This is especially refreshing after the previous season, where the viewer was made aware of the origin of the latest titan incursion far too early, and subsequently forced to watch the characters play catch up for a few gruelling episodes.
Almost equally refreshing is the huge drop in screen time given to Eren. This is probably much more personal than anything, but I find Eren to be one of the weakest characters in the series. His story is fleshed out enough, but it is used only as a justification for his one-dimensionality rather than a driving force behind complex emotions or motivations beyond ""must kill all titans."" I'm not a fan of shonen anime in general, and so I personally find anything reminiscent of angry revenge-bent fighting men yelling back and forth for episodes at a time a bit jarring. Mercifully, Eren finds himself incapacitated for the majority of this season, giving room for the impressive cast of side characters that AOT has masterfully developed to shine.
Pacing is still a slight issue towards the end of the season, and the arc does feel a bit detached from the grander narrative of humanity vs titans. I can see this being an issue for some viewers, but I felt that enough exposition was offered to offset these issues once on the other end. By becoming more grounded in people and politics, Season 3 sets a different standard of verisimilitude. This is shaken only by the drunken puppet king seeming a bit offensively lowbrow, references to Kenny massacring the military police, and Eren seeming surprisingly unshaken (other than his immediate reaction) by the huge revelations about his father. I'm not too familiar with the changes to the animation team for this season, but it does feel like the visual quality has dropped slightly compared to its predecessors. In contrast, the opening theme for this season is especially beautiful - both the visuals and song.
Season 3 gives considerable effort towards developing more characters such as Levi, Erwin, Historia, and more. Giving us glimpses of their younger selves, even in the opening theme, and further explaining their motivations and flaws goes a long way towards humanising them, something most peers of AOT within its genre neglect.
Overall, it almost feels as though some subplots of Season 3 were designed to be filler, offering slightly less consequential answers while setting up for its second part. Whatever their intentions, these arcs are executed well enough that they secure Season 3's stealing of the spotlight. Almost paradoxically, this season is the most ambitious leap so far by not utilising the external pure titan threat, which is the centrepiece of its ambitious premise. As this first part of the season ends with the resumption of the overarching narrative, I hope that the strides made here in repairing previous shortcomings continue.",8

                WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS
If you thought that the previous season had fun plot holes, with this one you will build a whole circus. Let's keep seeing what's the author had to offer us:
1. Useless sidestories: They introduced us a relative of Levi. What was the purpose of that? I don't know, because we didn't receive any type of relevant information to the plot. It was like a filler basically. 
2. Visions: Now, our protagonist Eren can have visions about what is going to happen next, that is, he has now acquired the ability to read the script in advance. How is this possible? Mystery.
3.
                  Armin being caught: The pursuit was really fun. One of the bands was quickier than the other when the script demands it. Why didn't make a more believable pursuit? I don't know. The writer has us used to challenging the physics and logic of his series. And talking to the logic, there are more inconsistencies in the following points.
4. Historia: She was part of a royalty that makes her more special and gives her special privileged abilitties. Why she didn't use them in the previous seasons? No fucking idea. Also, the Historia past is basically humanity vs humanity because there are an ability that can control all the titans. Why did was not mentioned in the previous seasons or, at least, an anticipation about it? Mystery. In other shonen, at least, the writers had the decency to show cliffhangers with future antagonists, kind of anticipating there's a bigger threat coming. This one looks like it came out outta nowhere. Now, the show should be called Attack on Politicians in this point.
5. Amnesia: Historia gave memories to Eren, I was freaking out when I saw this scene. Now the author decided to use the amnesia as a plot device. The reason of why this was a plot device is because the narrative flow depends on Eren remembering things. Mamma mia, now Eren is overpowered, has the ability to read the script in advance and can remember things in order to continue with the plot.
6. Founder Titan: By far, the worst plot hole of this season. This guy had the ability to manipulate all the amnesia and memories of a whole race. There are a lot of plot holes with this guy, for example: If he had world knowledge, why didn't he divulge it? I don't know, there should be at least some smart people that can be used this information for a good purpose. If this Titan, suposedly knew the current issues with the titans manipulation, why he didn't interfere? No fucking idea. What has this titan been up to throughout the series? Mystery. If this titan had done something, even if it was something small, the series would have been completely different. I suppose that this titan's will it's like the Force of Star Wars or the faith of Fast and Furious.
7. Victimization: If Eren, by himself, was a character he was not liked by many, now we see him cry and suffer for things that he has not done. Why does he cry for things that were not his fault? I don't know. It makes no sense for the writer to try to make us empathize with someone who is greatly benefited by the script. In many shonen, this same problem also occurs. In addition, Eren received more power ups in this season, like if he didn't receive enough of them.
Up to this point, I wouldn't be surprised if they featured later themes like time travel, Eren being a messiah or a cheap attempt to make him look like a martyr who wanted to save the world. Is this true? Let's find out in the next review where more laughs, plot holes and retarded aspects wait for us.",3
"
                By the time this season premiered, I had read and been keeping up with the Attack on Titan manga, so I knew already what to expect while going into this season. Season 3 covers the ""Uprising Arc,"" which is an extremely different turn from what we have normally been seeing in Attack on Titan so far--humans vs. titans. This arc takes on a more political stance and looks at the relationships between humans living in the walls.
This was one of the weakest arcs in the manga, and Isayama himself admitted he was not proud of it, which is why the anime changed up some things
                  and moved events around. I had no problem with these changes, and while a lot of people like to throw down on this arc, I have always enjoyed it, and I was glad to see a lot of people enjoy this arc as well.
As I said before, this arc takes a drastically different turn as the plot becomes highly political with a planned coup and royal family drama. While there is less titan activity in this arc, there are still elements of mystery to be explored, well-animated fight scenes between humans, and a strong character arc for Historia.
The animation continues to be excellent, the characters become more complex as their backstories are explored, and Sawano continues to put forward an excellent soundtrack. I know there was a lot of backlash over the opening to this season, as it was not done by Linked Horizon, but the opening tugs at the heartstrings and showcases the innocence our characters have lost all too quickly over these past few seasons. For these reasons, I think ""Red Swan"" is still a wonderful opening and is necessary for a season that focuses a little less on titans.
The Uprising Arc is by no means my favorite arc, but it is still an enjoyable and necessary arc that lays the groundwork for the upcoming arc. The first half of season 3 is obviously weaker compared to Season 3 Part 2, but it is still an enjoyable watch and continues to build on and improve this franchise.",10
"
                HYPE! HYPE! HYPE! DEAR LORD THIS SHOW IS DELIVERING IN SPADES. Ok, caps lock off, the season starts of with some of the most fluid and beautiful one take action choreography I think I have ever seen in anime. We finally see Eren take a damn chill pill and reflect on his actions and the pain he has caused and strive to do better. I swear every season this show switches genre cause S1 was a straight action shounen, S2 was a psychological thriller, and this was very much a political thriller and it delivered really, really well. We finally understand certain characters that have
                  been around since the beginning and the story is finally starting to show its hand in a way that doesn't feel contrived and is able to subvert expectations with certain things. I am firmly on this train and am excited to see where it takes me.",9
"
                This season is, by far, my favourite. It gave me everything I dreamed of and served it on a golden platter with Levi’s face engraved on it. 
I wasn’t expecting AOT to develop in this way, but I am so glad it’s taken the route of exploring characters, politics, backstories,... I couldn’t ask for more. 
Don’t worry, it still features some of the classics:
-Misaka’s only emotion and vocabulary being “Eren”
-Levi being Levi but better
-Eren kidnapped and literally not being around for ¾ of the anime
-Sasha’s ears being a gift from God
-Scout regiment releasing titans like mixtapesBut, we're also introduced to some new things:
-KENNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
-baby skeleton Levi
-Levi’s smile (I shit you not. I cried. It’s the most beautiful thing ever. RIP moi)
-Eren not hollering
-Eren’s back muscles (thank me later)
-The return of Pyxis, Zachary and the government (all of which slayed life itself)
-Historia/Christa’s woke-ness
Yes, yes, I know, there’s not as much Titan-fighting as season 1 and 2, in fact, there’s only one real titan fight, but shut up and let me shed some light on how this is the best season so far.
Season 3 is much slower than the previous two and that’s what makes it perfect. The pacing allows for so much world-building, character development and for the plot to progress well without it becoming boring. As much as I love season 1 and 2, they’re both primarily focused on fighting and just getting on with the action, which is nice and all, but it couldn’t go on forever, without the anime becoming a mess. In a story like this one, the politics and character developments are what makes it have that substance that sets AOT apart from other shounen. 
It’s really this season that’ll get you thinking, really connect you to the characters and tie a lot of loose ends. So, all the talking that happens in this season is important! Without it, you wouldn’t be able to learn about the Reiss Family, Grisha Yaeger, Levi’s background and much, much more. 
That said, I don’t see why people have a problem with the fight scenes, this season. I thought they were amazing! The way in which they’re planned out and executed is just *chef's kiss*. 
The talent of the scout regiment has never shone through any better. Whether it was rescuing Eren or rescuing Eren, Armin and Hange are geniuses who have to power to destroy the world and I can’t believe I had to wait this long to see their plans in action because It’s phenomenal.
I’ve seen some comments going around, complaining about how much of an annoying child Eren has become. He went from being this “yell at all” to “cry at all” in what seemed like one episode and that’s apparently triggering. I agree, but I also disagree. Yes he does act like a child, but that's becuase he is a child! 16 is not old. Yes, he does get real whiny, but that’s nothing new. What’s new, though, is Eren’s self- awareness. Character development. Finally. In the early seasons, Eren is portrayed as the typical shounen protagonist: driven, strong, screams a lot. Now, however, he’s beginning to be fleshed out, characterised as more than just a defeater- of- titans.
And he’s not the only one. Historia, as well as a couple of other characters, have minor but very impactful character development and it’s honestly the highlight of the anime.
On another note, I swear to god Eren’s eyes have changed colour. They used to be green and now they’re this blue, but sometimes kind of green?! Explanations, please?
There’s only one thing. One thing that disappointed me. Out of the entire anime, they had to get this one thing wrong: that opening song. It was so underwhelming. At the beginning of episode one, I was ready to stand up, do the salute and cry my eyeballs out, but all I got was this pretty song that still made me cry my eyeballs out. Don’t get me wrong, the theme itself is still amazing, but the song’s just ugh-meh. 
The ending song’s dope, though! Still, they better step it up next season because this opening theme’s not up to their usual standards.
Now, a couple of notes on the ending. [SPOILERS START HERE]
That last episode had me excited and terrified, at the same time. Excited because ohmylord they’re going to get wall Maria back. But terrified because ohmylord they’re either going to fail miserably or succeed with only one-third of the scout regiment.
It’s absolute genius what the producers did with the final ending theme: I mean, I didn’t understand shit of what was going on, but I think we all know who's going to die….dammit Erwin, I was actually starting to like him.
Until episode 4, I had completely forgotten about Annie’s existence. I know that she’s trapped in a cave somewhere, but is she still there? It’s interesting that they chose to mention her…
Grisha Yaeger and Kenny Ackerman both confuse the hell out of me. I don’t know what to think of Kenny. Was he really that Bad? And Grisha... I’m starting to doubt that he’s dead.
Episode 10’s my favourite episode of the entire anime, so far. It made my soul happy.",10
"
                <<NO SPOILERS>>
Ah yes. I, ANIME_FFS, am writing another review. After around 6 months, (and several days of procrastination), I have come back with an AOT review. Yes, I should have reviewed the first two seasons first but I didn't bother to type something about it. This season, though, made me love AOT way more and I shall enlighten you about this anime
Story - 9
AOT Season 3 finally arrives only to spread the sad news that it's sibling was lost in the earthquake of April 2019. Nonetheless, Part 1 delivers an amazing story continuation and here we are, dancing on it's fingertips and begging for more.
                  This time, the story doesn't focus on the titans but much more on the question that has been right in front of our eyes; who is Levi and what is his background? Needless to say, this season informs us well about Levi, his past and a new character-Kenny Ackermann. Is he connected to Mikasa? Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows? More context on Erwin's actual desire to join the Scouts and a MAJOR plot twist in the story takes place. Would've absolutely loved to give a 10 but I really hate cliffhangers.
Art - 10
Wit delivers the same, amazing visual again! The gorgeous animations and beautifully displayed artwork never fails to amaze me. My most favourite artwork in the entirety of the season (heck even in the anime!) is the opening. I don't understand why it's getting unnecessary hatred. It's my favourite opening overall because of the deeper meaning behind this season. It wonderfully displays the very basic roots of our much awaited 12 episodes and it is truly amazing. The Levi holding a dagger whille staring at Kenny, the wonderous trio as adorable children just having innocent fun, Erwin with his father and even Historia! I. Simply. Loved. It.
Sound - 8 
Red Swan is really^∞ GOOOOOOOD! Pair that up with a heartwarming and very well-made opening art, praised in the Art segment, and you amplify the feeling (if you already love this anime). I didn't like the ending as much as the opening because it kind of reminded me of the creepy music in seasons 1 and 2. The voice acting in this anime, heck in the entire franchise, is really on-point with the expressions and you can feel the chaos in shaken voices as well the frenemy banter between Eren and Jean. Again, really love the opening!
Character - 9
We see a relatively huge amount of character development in this season as Eren, not only doesn't get abducted a second time, but now has become a calm and collected being. He does have an existential crisis moment but snaps out of it pretty quickly. Historia goes from the innocent, kind and inarguably cute person to a woman of change, with a very good sense of duty and leadership. Other characters like Jean and Armin develop pretty well too, with Armin becoming more responsible and mature while Jean too exhibits such change. Mikasa doesn't change much but Connie and Sasha become much better friends, it seems; almost as if they're siblings.(not a spoiler dw)
Enjoyment - 10
I absolutely loved this season! There was something to it that made me enjoy this more than the other seasons. I think it's because in this season, they don't introduce new questions and answers quite a few of them. I also really like the U-turn they made and showed humans actually fighting each other, which makes it somewhat more realistic as it's pretty much difficult to completely unite 2 opposing factions with different ideals. I'm in love with the opening and season 3 made me much more interested in the franchise. It's not too cliched but at the same time, not too unpredictable. I give this anime a 9/10!",9
"
                Well, didn't expect this show to be split cour! I bet a lot of people are disappointed, but hey, I'm going to Disney in a week so if it weren't for this I'd be missing a couple of episodes lol! So I might as well write a review...
Art and Sound- Same Ol' 9/10: Despite how WIT should be grasping at straws production-wise, this actually looks and feels like the best season so far (although second cour could prove that wrong). Also a lot of the best animations this show has offered thus far are present here.
The voice acting is the same. Since there's more character
                  development this time around, Eren isn't a screamy brat. 
The new opening is a really nice contrast to the previous openings. Song-wise, I still find Sasageyou to be the best, but as far as the theme of the visuals in the opening, Red Swan takes the cake!
Story- 8/10: This season adapts mangaka Isayama's least favorite part of the manga... I don't know what it's officially called, but it is notorious for the large lack of Titans and the focus on conspiracies and politics.. I personally never felt it to be a problem in the manga, but whatever went wrong had to be amended here. 
I don't have good enough memory to notice any differences, but this version is pretty solid regardless. Most people probably hated it solely because of the lack of Titans.
Characters- 9/10: Without Titans messing things up, this is an opportune moment for the people we've been spending the last two seasons with to... well... talk. 
We get a lot of great new characterization from pretty much everybody as they have to start fighting their battles within the walls instead of outside of them. 
I can't say anything else because of spoilers, however, so I'll just end this portion of the review in this very anti-climactic manner.
Enjoyment and Overall- 8/10: I've given every season of this show 8s across the board, but tbh this season is set up to be my favorite season so far.
Now let us all wait until spring 2019 for them to ruin everything!
Also, WIT you freakin' trolls with that sneak preview of next cour at the end (if it's the scene from the manga I think it is...)! I mean, it's not as bad as season 1's ""Oh! Wall Titan!"" *waits 4 years*, but still holy crap!!!
'Kay review over now.
KEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYY! Okay done for real now.",8
"
                I'ma keep this short cause I'm lazy and so are you. No spoilers. 
This season was pretty good, thought not as good as the last 2 in my opinion, for only one reason. Time skips. There seems to be some relatively important stuff being passed over, obviously so they can fit enough material into the 12 episode anime block (don't know if they flesh it out in the manga but I imagine they do) but it still gives you that longing to figure out what you missed. Other than that its the same beautiful art, dynamic characters, amazing fighting scenes, and godtier music. I'm going
                  to put up a 9, even thought its like a 9.7, just because saying its 10 wouldn't be justified.",9
"
                Honestly, I enjoyed this season so much. It was nice to take a break from the constant fighting and have some really touching character moments.
Also, Historia's arc was just done so beautifully. Gosh, do I love 1 (one) girl. This season alone is reason enough to continue watching the series. Though season 2 is close with this one. I just could go on forever about how everything they did including Historia was a masterpiece but that counts as spoilers so I cant,,,
The animation has also improved so much honestly. Also, the opening and endings were just beautiful, they really set the tone for the season.
                  Of course, after getting such a ""nice"" season I'm not sure I'm ready for the upcoming bloodbath.
Also, Eren surprisingly got a lot more interesting as a character which I appreciated. He went from angsty ""argh I wanna kill titans"" to an actual character (in my opinion).
Levi's arc was also super duper good.
Also, Sasha and Connie got some love so that's A+++++.",9
"
                I honestly can't grasp how this season has such a high rating.  Season 1 was fantastic. Season 2 was an abysmal disappointment. Now this time it does come out better than 2, but not by much. 
Story: What's to say? It dragged on, focused on elements that lead no where, hinted multiple times at awesome scenarios, usually through slow character pondering, simply for it to never happen in favor of something cliche. There was very little plot progression, the pacing was terrible, and honestly, the story was just handled in the most pathetic ways possible.
Art: Like usual, the art was decent.
Sound: What's to say?
                  Unlike originally, the music is garbage now.
Characters: Once likable and relatable, they are now annoying and 1 dimensional. Especially the lead roles for most part.
Enjoyment: Very little to be had. I stuck it out, as a fan... but I no longer consider myself a fan of Shingeki no Kyojin. 
Overall: I'm truly disappointed so many fanboys n girls out there can't see past their bias. This show does not by any stretch of the imagination live up to expectations, and after season 2, my expectations were quite low.  It in no way deserves the rating it has.",3
"
                Spoiler Free Review
Okay, not often do I say this, but I'm going to say this--this is an anime adaptation that's definitely better than the manga. The Uprising arc in the manga was easily my least favorite arc in the series. There were too many politics and far too much dialogue that honestly felt like a chore to read. But this anime season, I swear they cut out all of the boring content.
This was an action filled season and yes there were still politics involved, but it was hardly a bore. I found this season truly thrilling and it's easily my favorite season yet. The animation
                  is absolutely beautiful and I promise you that it won't be long when you start this season until you see some crazy scenes.
Keep in mind this is just the first half of the season. The second half doesn't release for a while. So this season only covers the Uprising arc. I look forward to the second half! Highly reccomend this season.",9
"
                When I entered,
Attack On Titan Season 3
I was expecting, Titan Battles and really bad story and Characters being used so they can just die.
But...
Season 3 changed my mind of the series, overall.I was confident in my first opinion and when I watched episode 1 of Season 3, it was being the normal Attack On Titan, until...when they started talking about the character Kenny.
For a few minutes, I was still thinking, eh Levi is just gonna kick his ass. But...once Kenny appeared. I was like holy shit, that did not just happen and when Episode 2 the beginning of the episode, OOOH, was it not hype? It just felt like a whole different show for 3 minutes.
The action consumed me, as I realized this show isn't just about titans but, I realize that they're are also humans out there who are just like the titans, like reiner and berhtold. aaaaaand then Eren gets captured, just by being the normal Eren. So I thought it turned back to normal, so I stuck onto the episodes for a bit, since they were interesting.
and then.
a big reveal, had came on episode 6.
the moment the 2 royal bloods touched eren's back, that moment i was like wait what the fuck is about to- and then when eren got a surge of memory of his dad's memory, i fucking lost my mind and got off of my seat and yelled outside on my balcony ""ATTACK ON TITAN IS THE BEST ANIME.""
Season 3 Part 1 brought a fucking roller coaster, it was as if we got in a car crash and other cars kept crashing into us for 1 minute.
I'm gonna end this fast and say, the first part of the anime was AMAZING. And I watched Part 2, and Part 2 is more amazing then this, so I suggest you watch it :)",10
"
                The plot of the story deepens and it starts to reveal itself, this season does a really good job at keeping you interested in the plot. Again, this is a 9.5/10 (but I will stick with 9 for this review).
Story 10/10: The story starts to mature up a little bit, it's no longer this simpleton human vs titan conflict. The politics of the walls start to act up, the different factions are divided on what their next move should be.
Art 10/10: As good as always.
Sound 10/10: As good as always.
Character 9/10: Initially, this show was thought of as the game of thrones of anime, because
                  the writer could, at any moment, kill an important character, just like in GoT. But this idea of character handling starts to die out in this season. The show, now, only introduces new (insignificant) characters, keeps them around for a bit and then kills them. While this is not that big of a deal, because the story is good, I still feels like this is a slight flaw in this season, especially as the main characters have survived some things that, in previous seasons, they simply wouldn't have survived.
Enjoyment 9/10: It starts slow and gets really good towards the end.
Overall 9/10: This is still a show that I highly recommend.",9
"
                Development is an important part of a series as a whole to keep people interested. If your characters remain stagnant, it's hard to follow an arc other than ""this person does this thing every 3 episodes to win."" I think Attack on Titan has been a great example of the theme and purpose changing over time. While it starts out in Season 1 as what seems like gore porn, it develops into an intricate plot of a nation's issues with an overbearing monarchy, racism, and near total annihilation. While some mysteries are close to being solved, others still linger in the background. Two things have
                  developed well over these three seasons: the story, and the characters.
The story has become almost a full political intrigue plot rather than simply a ""fighting giants"" story. It almost reminds me of how Code Geass wasn't ""just a mecha"" anime, it was a political story with a mecha theme. The actual structure of the society becomes much more apparent, with it's relation to the kingdom and how that power structure has remained in place for so many years. Family names even matter over time, with some clans being marked enemies of the state and others beloved and eternal friends. Some didn't really like the direction going away from the horrific and satisfying action, however I welcomed the change. Learning more about this universe seems integral to the experience, and parallels the one the characters go through as they learn about their very small world. Overall, the pacing is decent, and it doesn't suffer through some piss-poor ramp up/down episodes that so many shows seem fond of. It's a slow and methodical build to a climax that was pretty satisfying.
Character's agendas are revealed over time, and it's not always just a one track monologue that reveals the villains plans, but slowly executed plot points where they try to impose their will on the world. Some are in it for power, some for peace, and some for revenge. However, slowly everyone's true intentions come to the forefront. Some also gain motivation over time, or change their points of view completely. Go back to S1 and see Eren's motivations as straight up revenge, and see if they stack up to how he ends this season. The skills of these characters develop over time, yet they also remind us that they still try to remain the same in personality between conflicts. They can create a character without making a stereotype, or having them be a one trick pony. Sasha is a good example, food is her main gag, but she's still played as a serious character in combat and story with her interactions with Conney and others.
If I had any complaint at all, it would be that I preferred the old art style. It's not that this new one is necessarily bland, but I thought the old one added a lot of flavor and intensity to the world. The fights and animations are still great to watch and pretty hype.
Still, a strong third seasons, and with so many shows only getting two that's a welcome surprise.",7
"
                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
This was a bold new direction for the Attack on Titan franchise...seeing how for almost the entire season didn't actually have any Titans to...Attack...on? Did it pay off? In the end, yes, but the ride was a little bumpy.
This season puts all its chips on characters, which up to this point has definitely been a weakness of the series. You've had your stand outs like Jean, but you also have Eren McYells Alot, unbearably stupid aristocrats that are evil just because they're aristocrats, and so, so, so many uninteresting red shirts there to be eaten by Titans. The characters in previous seasons
                  weren't so bad it ruined the rest of the show, but they weren't the major draw either.
This season immediately sets to work trying to change that with an early scene of Historia and Eren talking. Eren points out Historia has changed a lot, before she was too nice and hard to believe and now she just felt...normal, and you know what? He's absolutely right. Wait a second, did Eren just go 5 minutes without screaming about murdering Titans? Turns out he's mellowed a lot too.
This gets to the main complaint of the season though, because they took it too far. Historia is more believable, but she's also just kind of...boring. Turns out her nice act was just an act, but what's underneath? Not really anything. For most of the season the plot revolves heavily around her, and the entire time I'm wondering who she even is. Eren meanwhile is just depressed, which, to be fair, makes sense. He feels guilty about all the people who have died because of him, and it's finally enough to make him snap a little, but I thought we were past his. I thought Mikasa's speech last season thanking him for staying strong, awakening his deus ex machina power was supposed to symbolize him growing and maturing. Eren doesn't feel like he's grown though, just the opposite, feels like he's a whole new character.
But then...that changed. We learn Historia's back story, that she was ignored by her father and despised by her mother, and that she felt worthless, so she put on a face of being impossibly nice while all the while trying to die in a blaze of glory just to feel useful. When she had that smacked out of her, she latched herself onto anything she felt gave her purpose, be it the scouts, or her father. When getting tugged in a million directions finally breaks her and she gets a second to look in a mirror, she realizes she doesn't need someone else to give her meaning, she can do that herself, and the meaning she gives herself is making people who feel unwanted and worthless realize they're wrong, that they do have worth, and they can be happy, and her first project is Eren, who's descended so much by this point he's asking her to kill him. By the end, she was great! It just wasn't always very interesting on the way there.
We see this pattern with other characters too. Eren by the ending was the best version of himself, when he and Jean got in a fight, expecting someone to stop them, only for no one to step in, so they both just keep punching because they can't bear to admit they don't hate the other? That's hilarious and interesting without the psychotic undertones that have plagued his character for most of the series, but depressed Eren was just painful to watch getting to that point. Kenny was a great villain, but they saved all of his characterization to his very last scene. Historia's father...actually, I have no clue what his deal was, he kind of just sucked the whole time.
In the end, I like where we ended up, but I'm really scratching my head how we got here.",7
"
                So, this is the season where everything starts to make sense. All the flaming questions we all had are starting to come together, finally, after more than 30 episodes. Can I just take a moment to appreciate the wonderful suspense this anime has? It wouldn't be the same if they just straight up got into it in the first seasons. And they're even letting space for more - actually, WAY more. The only thing I missed about this part was the fights - but as someone that is now starting the second part, I can tell: there are plenty.
Let's go to the ratings:
Story: 10. Seriously,
                  I had so many theories about the titans that I feel relieved now that I know a bunch already - I'm still waiting for more. The new characters they introduced were great too, and their arcs are completely necessary to the whole story.
Art: 9. Damn, the artstyle keeps getting better. The titan animations keep improving, and so does the whole city and architecture. I personally love the way they animated the swirls and jumps on the ODM gear.
Sound: 10. What the hell, this opening! I literally can't stress enough how much I love this. 
Character: I'm giving this a 9 only because I still want to see more development, I feel that some characters had no overlook on their past or objectives. Still, the characters are finally coming together and growing, not only in the battlefield, but subjectivelly too.
Enjoyment: 10. There's no way to dislike what this first part had to offer, because it's literally what (I believe) we were all waiting patientely for the past seasons. I still thrive for more, though.
Overall: 9. I'm only giving it a 9 because I thought that the 3 last episodes should've had a little more action, they were just a little bit too slow for my taste in action anime.",9
"
                The series just keeps getting better and better!!! I enjoy seeing ""Attack on Titan"" come to life through the beautiful animations that WIT Studio provides/provided to the series!!! 
I REALLY enjoyed the scene where Carla cared deeply for her son, Eren, and said that Eren is already special!!! (Carla's a good mom!!) 
I also REALLY like how the ending of the 12th episode of the third season of ""Attack on Titan"" showed some scenes of what will happen next on the second part of the third season of ""Attack on Titan""!! 
I think that ""Attack on Titan"" has the most beautiful artworks and animations,
                  as well as the best storyline out of the other manga/anime that I've read/seen so far!!! 
""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS"":

"
                SPOILER FREE REVIEW.
First let me say that as of writing this review I have only seen the first 10 episodes of this season and that my opinion of the show may change, while this review will remain the same as I am lazy af.
Art/Animation: 2/3
The art in this show is on point the scenes are great and the characters are well designed. The animation is also amazing with most scenes looking amazing..... the key word there was most. Although not always noticeable, this show has some instances of very very bad CGI, quite often when the characters are using their grappling lines and the screen
                  is moving rather fast. However, these scenes are not common and do not really hinder the enjoyment of the show. Despite this I cannot award a show that has instances of poor CGI a 3/3 for animation hence the 2/3.
Story: 2/4
Bland and typically story. There is the macguffin of the item in the bottom of Erins basement which drives the plot, and there are a series of interesting but predictable side stories keeping them from reaching said macguffin. 
Compared to last season, this season has good progression. The only thing I can really complain about is that the back stories are sometimes placed in rather frustrating positions. Although this is not always the case, for example the some of the backstory of (censored for spoiler)  is placed at the end of the arc, which does not mess with the passing, although he is kinda irrelevant now as  (censored for spoilers).
Also this anime seems to be pushing the story in an overly edgy vibes again, but this is something I have come to expect given the edge fest of Erins personality in season 1. 
Finally there are inconsistencies in this plot, nothing on the level of JoJo, but still present. Obviously these wont be discussed for spoiler reasons, and personally I don't really mind them.
Overall the story is nothing special but it is sufficient to push the viewers forward to the next action scene. Hence 2/4
Sounds/Music 2/3.
Voice actors in the sub are good and the dub is....... well it's a dub but as dubs go this is acceptable. Honestly my only complaint is the freaking OP which feels really out of place. Hence the 2/3
Bonus Points: 1
Despite my criticisms I actually enjoy this show quite a bit and it has come out in a very bland season where I only had Planet With and Overlord as decent animes (others were alright). So for giving me something to watch that was well produced and directed I am giving it one bonus point.
Conclusion 7/10
Good show, nothing  too spectacular. I personally recommend that all people who enjoy action scenes check it out. With the only real let down being the bog standard plot.  Go stream it on crunchyroll, personally I wouldn't pay for it though",7

Guy 2: ""Yeah, how could i not? They were practically half the screen time.""

Guy 2: ""What?!?!? This is the next SEASON, they should be getting answers""

                The sequel we've been spared the wait for.
- Story (8/10):
Unlike the earlier installments, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 focused more on an aspect you never expect a show like this to address, more than fights and massacres, it was heavy on politics, but why would you complain? We at least got to know way more about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin than any other seasons, and thanks to this, a lot of our questions were answered, and the more episode you watched, the closer to the truth you get “Gotta tell this to my buddy, Erwin”. Not to say fights were absent, oh no,
                  there is a massacre on a huge scale, but the sheer exposure of world building and new information made those look very minimalistic.
A lot of things finally made sense, earlier we had something like an uncut follow of past events that we needed juxtaposition for so bad in order to tie some sense to them, that's what this season was mostly about. The pacing felt a little bit slow, mainly because of the dialogue-heavy nature of the season.
- Art (9/10):
We've gotten to the point where it's not at the least a surprise to expect high-quality animation, some fans will even use the franchise's title as a synonym for “fantastic animation”.
Without having to stretch this any longer, you know you're getting your doses of blood, the gloomy color pallets only make the medieval atmosphere feel more dense and alive. However, the only complaint I have, and only had about Shingeki no Kyojin is the lack of variety for unique character face design, if you really took the time, you can spot a disturbing similarity in their general facial structure; short rephrased, they look alike.
- Sound (9/10):
As good as the animation, the soundtrack is as great. This season introduced a bit of a controversial opening theme song, which a lot of people thought it was an insult to the previous ones. I for one think it's a solid song with or without the Anime, it's great, it's packed with emotion, contracts the portrayed story arc very well, I get it's not your typical loud and hype Shingeki no Kyojin opening, but it remains better than some in respect of quality.
- Character (8/10):
Out of all the other installments, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 was packed with character development, especially for Historia, you can even call it her season.
We've got teased about her on the earlier seasons, especially season 2, and here we got to peek under the blanket and see what was up there, and oh boy was it shocking. Eren as well got to know some truth about his lost memories, and thus had his level up to some degree in terms of character building.
- Enjoyment (7.5/10):
Entertainment comes in many forms, the earlier season gave us the hype with the cinematic dynamic camera freestyling over the fantastic battles, and this one had us watch out jows from hitting the ground from sheer wowing for what we get to know about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin. Enjoying your favorite characters' moments.
The midpoint of the show was a little bit meh compared to the beginning and the ending points though.
- Overall (8.3/10):
We've been promised of getting a full 24 episodes action-packed third season, but at some point they decided to split it in half and have the first 12 episodes focus on the political stuff, and the other half reintroduce us to raw action in “probably” the most hyped season yet, but unfortunately that got delayed for some time now.
For me, season two is still the top of hype for the franchise, until we get some more shocking revelation and hyped fights that would remain as such. However, not to say that this season falls down in terms of quality of anything, we've just been spoiled way too much, having us wait 4 years for a sequel at the time had us hungry for more content, it made the good better and the bad good.",8
"
                Well, this is the first time I'm making a review so yeah, deal with it.
This might contain some few spoilers: You have been warned.
Season 3 finally hits us with a new approach to the plot, instead of dealing with Titans, it deals with the politics, and Titans became very infrequent, focusing solely on the fight known as ""Attack on Government."" 
Not that it's the bad thing, this is the season which will give answers to the question the viewers have since the first season.
Art: 10
Wit Studio doesn't disappoint us this season, giving us viewer a very beautiful animations. Special mention to the most famous one,
                  ""Levi vs Kenny's Squad"". There's no real issue with the animation, it was very outstanding to the point you're having a goosebumps.
Sound: 10
The music is perfect this season as well, the OST which adds to the intensity of various scenes, ranging from well-choreographed fight scenes to the saddest episodes. The OP is amazing since it fits the arc, as well as the ending which created by the famous Linked Horizon. And of course, the infamous sound in the final episode which, admit it, we didn't see coming.
Character: 8
Eren - got some pretty decent development in this arc, in the previous season, he is very arrogant and very quick to into fights. In this season, he has learned to control himself and think properly. And if someone told you that Eren only spend this arc crying, let me tell you, it was justified.
Eren is a 15 year old boy, full of thoughts regarding revenge. In just a short amount of time, a lot has happened to him which is the following: almost got eaten by a Titan, discovered that can transform into a Titan, his friends from Squad Levi is killed, discovers that Annie is the one who killed them, found out the responsible for the murder of his mother, got kidnapped by the military, and found out the secret of his father. For a 15 year old boy, that was very heavy, telling him to shut up will not help, let him process everything.
Historia - her importance has been hinted in Season 2, seeing this played this season is very rewarding, ""Started from the barracks now a Queen."" Her character has been fleshed out, her backstory is fully explained, and her importance to the plot is recognized.
Levi - Levi is very fleshed out in this arc, his history and lineage has been revealed, how he got powerful, and how he actually feels. He's not just a badass character, he has a personality to match.
And Erwin - Erwin's character has been fleshed out as well, and his commanding power, a lot has happened to him this arc and he has just one arm.
Those four are probably the most developed characters in the series. But gotta give props to other as well.
Kenny - his existence screams badassery, he is a very interesting character and every screen time about him means something, from his introduction to his end, he has served his purpose.
Armin - not really much, but his character developed from a lowkey pacifist to someone who will hold a gun to kill a person to save another person. It's a huge step up.
Mikasa - still the same, Mikasa being Mikasa, she really has no character development here, probably because she got one in previous season.
Al in all, outsanding character developments.
Story: 10
Now, this one, the story's new approach is very refreshing, it decided to drift off from the usual to give way to plot developments. The story this time is taking down the government and put Historia as a Queen, because apparently, the government hides the truth to the people, everything is a spoiler so I won't tackle it further.
This also shows the history of the Royal Family where Historia belongs to and the cause of Grisha Yaeger's disappearance.
This arc is full of revelations which I deeply appreciate, since the reveals here will makes the plot go forward. 
Although, the anime decided to rearrange the events from the manga, it doesn't affect the storytelling at all since Isayama himself supervises it since he himself doesn't like how slow the arc.
So, this arc, overall, has a smooth movements in it's pacing, not too rush and not too slow.
Enjoyment: 10
I really enjoyed this season.
""I don't know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that... No matter what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it's right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice."" - Levi Ackerman",10
"
                Oh God, what a let down. After giving season 1 and 2 such high scores, I wasn't expecting for me to be so uninterested this season. Perhaps I was too blinded by the huge spectacle of it all, but it seems to have finally worn off on me. Where I do begin?
The story never once managed to hook me or keep me interested. It felt like they just spewed out backstories for characters hoping one of their sob stories would manage to strike a cord in our hearts - unfortunately for me, it never did. I realize that for all of the side characters, and
                  even the well-beloved main characters like Armin and Levi, they could die and I wouldn't bat an eye. I think I'd get more sadness from watching the characters reactions than the actual death itself. I think that's telling of how well developed the characters are. Apart from that, I see how they were trying to connect all the different pieces together in an attempt to be more cohesive, but it doesn't make up for the fact that it isn't even interesting to begin with. Nothing comes as a surprise or shock anymore. The fight scenes don't have the high stakes they used to. There are never any major casualties or consequences and so I'm left being extremely bored during fights, which is a shame being that the combat is one of the things the show excels at. Honestly, I'm just confused and a bit let down. I hope part 2 and the subsequent season 4 deliver something better than this. The art is good, as always. The OP and ED are good, as always. 
I just don't know how I feel about AoT anymore. I was so hyped watching the first season and also the second season. I'm not sure what happened - maybe I'm just getting tired of seeing characters I really don't care about. Ugh.",5
"
                Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin if you prefer) is a series i have a very odd relationship with. It's first season is actually the show that properly got me into anime as a whole (i'm not counting things like Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon etc) and though over time as i watched more and better shows my opinion on it began to change and while i still enjoyed it i began to see things i didn't really like in the series, character and pacing issues in particular. It's second season however while it had a very strong first half, it's second half and ending left a very
                  sour taste in my mouth. So when it came to the 3rd season i was not very excited going into it but was still willing to give it a fair try. And I can honestly say that... This is the best AoT has been without a shadow of a doubt i really liked S3 and while not perfect it certainly reignited my interest in the series. But without further adieu let's dive into the review.
So S3 picks up pretty much after the events of S2, i won't bother summarising as if your reading this you've likely watched both prior seasons. As opposed to prior seasons which were all ""Titans coming gotta kill em"" this season focuses on the corruption within the government as well as the history of the royal family and a few key characters. My biggest gripe in S2 was the lack of forward progression in the story. Yes there were a couple of big reveals but nothing that really progressed things, things started and ended in the same place or at the very least it was a tip toe forward. S3 thankfully has tons of forward progression, reveals, plot twists and answers to questions we've had since the first season. This coupled with some really good character development throughout this season have really helped elevate the story for me. However not everything is perfect. 
(Some spoilers ahead)
My biggest problem with the story is that in the initial setup is ""Eren's been kidnapped gotta rescue him"" for the 3rd goddamn time. Like if it was spaced out more i wouldn't mind too much, but the fact over all 3 season Eren has been kidnapped and rescued in ALL 3 seasons is honestly a bit of a joke. Also a particular scene in one of the later episodes which would've been a great scene, if not for the edgy dialogue. Like maybe that one is just me but too me the it came off as super edgy and kinda took away from what would've been otherwise a great scene. Also this isn't really a positive or a negative but still something i want to comment on. In the final episode there is a mid credit scene that is... interesting to say the least. It appears to be a flash forward to an event which will happen in S3 part 2, it just seems odd they'd choose to tease this since they've never done it before. Again not a positive or a negative just something i found odd. But regardless overall i feel that S3 has had a particularly strong story.
Art has always been one of AoTs strong points. The show has always looked great and this season is no exception with Wit Studios really pulling out their A game in terms of art and animation with everything looking smooth slick and really really good, particularly in the action scenes. Outside of that the show still looks good no real complaints with the art overall
Sawano is on the soundtrack that's all i need to say... Fine i'll elaborate. Sawano once again pulls put his best for AoT. Like the man only really has one style, but he does that style so well that it doesn't really matter, pulling out some amazing tracks including a rap track that was used during one of the major fight scenes that I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND, that was really damn good. Outside of the soundtrack the overall sound design is well done as always and the voice acting continues to be good as well.
The characters of AoT have always been an interesting topic to me. Lots of people love them however I've always found the characters of the show to be rather weak. Not all of them mind, characters like Armin, Erwin, Jean, Hange, Levi as well as a few others are very well presented characters however i feel quite a lot of the characters have honestly been rather weak, either not getting any development or just being their to be killed. However S3 actually has a lot of really good character development for a few key members of the cast. For starters Eren... EREN ACTUALLY HAS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT OH MY GOD FINALLY... Seriously prior to this season i HATED Eren. All he really did was yell, get captured, yell at people when they tried to explain stuff to him, then complain that he doesn't understand anything. However in S3 he actually has development as a character, ending this part of the season in a different place than he began which has slightly improved my opinion on him, i still don't really like him but it's a good starting point. Historia, who is the main focus of the arc also greatly benefits from development. And aside from a couple moments i feel fell flat she grew into a much stronger and more interesting character. There were some new characters introduced but the only real stand out was Kenny who serves as one of the antagonists and he is just such a fun character, i mean he's basically a steampunk cowboy you don't get cooler than that, but his story is also interesting and adds a lot more lore to the AoT world which was really cool. That all being said a lot of the newer characters introduced felt like filler characters to either be killed off or not do much regardless, a problem AoT has had for a while. And another problem i have comes from one particular character. Mikasa... now wait a sec, overall i think she is a decent character, a strong heroine who's backstory is interesting (even more so with some revelations made in this season) but her obsessive protective nature over Eren i think honestly detracts from her character. I get why she wants to protect Eren but it's just played up far too much and their was a scene towards the end of this season, where Eren and Historia are having a conversation after everything that had happened, Mikasa walks up does her scary eyes and takes Historia away. It's played more for laughs but i just really didn't like that scene and it detracted a bit from Mikasa for me. But overall i do feel that the character work in the season was very strong, stronger than it had been.
In the end, I enjoyed this season. It really rekindled my interest in AoT to the point i can say I'm legitimately excited for the second half of S3 next year. So if you've finished season 2 and still want more, i can say it only gets better here.",9
"
                Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyojin if you prefer that) is one of my favorite anime. I have seen several, but it always delivers excessive excitement, thrills, and a complex world with so much endearment. Season 2 was my favorite anime of last year and one of the best second seasons I've ever seen. Coming from that, I was a bit worried for this arc, as I had heard of it being poor and whatnot. However, the idea of politics and human V.S. human really got me excited. And it did not fail to deliver.
Seriously though, the execution in this season man, like, oh
                  my god. The new plotline, following governmental things, had me a bit ""meh"" at first, to where I was questioning if this was really Attack on Titan. However, the ending of episode 1 had me pumped, and I knew exactly from then on that this was gonna be a damn good season. The chase scene in episode 2, the backstory to Historia in episode 3, almost every episode had something to offer, whether it'd be a major secret reveal, a memorable fight, or something else. 
One thing that really caught me by surprise was the development and the new characters, in particular with Historia. I was shocked at how much Historia has developed by the end of this season. After all of the development she had last season, I'm just completely shocked at how much more she got fleshed out. Other characters, such as Kenny and Rod Reiss, were nice additions to the cast. Levi got about 100000000x more screen time in this season than the last, and we even found out his backstory, which is quite nice. My only real complaint here would be the complete lack of Reiner, Bertholdt and Ymir, but I know they're going to play a major role in the next arc so not too dissapointed there.
The animation looks nothing short of spectacular, especially during the chase scene in episode 2. I'll admit there were some quality dips here and there, but that's expected with the situation that WIT is in. Despite some minor dips in quality, the animation is just simply breathtaking. Never has it looked THIS good. The OST is fantastic too, specifically the Kenny theme (don't know the actual name of the song but it's awesome). The opening is much different from previous openings, but is perfect for this season, and is simply holy. The voice of Hyde is stunning, and the opening is amazing. The ending theme is pretty good, especially in episode 12. 
In the end, this was another awesome season of aot. It did take a bit of a different turn compared to previous seasons but was just as thrilling, and provided so much history. I'll admit, I didn't enjoy this season as much as season 2, and the shock factor wasn't quite there, but I know season 3.5 (the second half we have to wait HALF A YEAR FOR) will have plenty of that, just from what I've heard and saw during the ending of episode 12. 
9.3/10
We need season 3.5 NOW",9
"
                If you were ever watching Attack on Titan and you were like ""man this is good but I wish there weren't so many big funny naked dudes"", this is the season for you. I'm a fan of the total left turn into the political thriller genre, it somehow feels like a really natural follow up to everything before.
If you've been waiting for the show to actually be about something, here you go. Sure it's basically following the general arc that every zombie movie+show+etc does (""what if people are the real monsters""). But The Walking Dead doesn't have Captain Levi flying around like spider-man cutting off
                  the heads of other people, who are also flying around like spider-man.
The show does a fantastic job of putting you in the Scouts' place narratively. There's so much shit going on and you know as little as they do. By the time they brutally murder their hundredth MP soldier to save shitty Eren, you start to get this nagging feeling that the other guys are probably right. But don't worry about that man. The Scouts got more people to kill baby. Also, turns out killing people yourself is even more traumatic than watching them get eaten. Viewers get to watch in real time as these beloved 16 year old child soldiers give up any pretense of being good people.
And then, after all the killing is over, you still know almost nothing about the world. Cause everyone that knew jack shit got a sword stabbed through their chest. Oops.",8
"
                this show had me hooked from the very beginning, and it has amazed me with how consistent it is. every season has improved upon the last in almost every aspect. the show has done an amazing job with the mysteries of its world, revealing new knowledge at the perfect moments both to keep the viewer attached and to progress the overarching plot. just when you think you have a good idea of the rules and secrets behind the Titans, humans, and world, another secret is uncovered that changes everything. based on the characters of the first season, I never would have guessed the arcs of
                  some of them. I feel like there is no way season 3 part 2 can top this, but apparently it does. I am excited to see where it goes from here.",9
"
                re-posting my list-comment as review, originally written May 9th 2021:
it's a little hard to rate just the first half of the third season on it's own, because I watched the entire thing in one sitting.. that fact alone should speak for itself though! So this includes the first 12 episodes of season 3! First off; animation-wise I feel like there was a huge development between season 1 and 3, and I feel like a big part fo that happened after season 2 and during season 3! This can also have to do with the locations and source material they were able to work with though.
                  
Alright; Season 3 is where you really get the satisfying payoff for sticking with the anime. Still - this goes for all seasons - the pacing is great and there's zero dead air. The third season manages to unveil a lot of secrets that you've been rooting for to learn about for a long time, while adding new questions and keeping the suspense for how it all pieces together! We also get to visit some details and characters in earlier seasons that I never questioned, but getting the added information and background feels extremely satisfying and rewarding. 
This season has some elements that are very different from the first two seasons, mainly the focus on human-interaction and politics that wasn't as prominent earlier. All in all the story is just SO compelling that I'm willing to give this a 10, and at the same time I want to not give it a 10 to set apart just HOW MUCH I liked the second part of the 3rd season. That being said, I find it hard to judge the two separated, because (extremely mild spoiler?) the second part of the 3rd season is basically one very long episode cut up into several parts. I feel like both as standalone would be a 9 each, but together as a cohesive season it becomes a 10. The only deduction I wanna make is that it features the (for me) least memorable opening, inbetween some very iconic ones! the sound is STILL getting a 10 though, because the music within the series is just perfectly placed to draw you into the story throughout all seasons.",10
"
                i only saw one single episode, and let me tell you, i hate this so much, first of all i'll have you know that is NOT how swords work, those swords are based off of boxcutters which are supose to break at the end because they get blunt. this is unbelievable, the amount of detail that goes into this anime is honestly so astonishingly low, i don't believe this will be any good if they put giant boxcutters up to no good, i seriously cannot get this across my head and i will be leaving the worst score on this.
loved it tho 8/10

                Going into Attack on Titan I had been fine with season 1 and mildly disappointed with season 2. I still feel justified with my opinion of those two seasons as the pacing and story slowly was weaker. I was very worried for season 3. It is greater than it's predecessor's by a huge distance. Perhaps my taste's are driven more towards political drama, but the positions character's are placed in are tense, high staked, make sense and the characters make the same deciscions we would should we have been in the same position. Newly introduced characters and villains pose a genuine threat as well as
                  acting like human beings pushed to their limit making them more understandable as well as terrifying. It is by far the best of the first three seasons, and I hope this streak of brilliance carries on throughout the 4th season.",9
"
                Poorly thought-out and often self-contradicting story in gorgeous wrappings. That is Attack on Titan in a nutshell. I know that not having the story completely mapped out right away is the industry standard, when it comes to creation of a typical manga series. But I think the great authors of the industry are conscious enough of their own work that they can avoid trampling all over their previous story beats while they keep adding in new stuff. In Attack on Titan, it feels like every addition to the show's lore makes the setting less and less compelling.
""Why did the character say THAT if THIS happened?""
                  or ""If they knew about THIS, why did they act THAT way?"" Good writing will keep questions like these from ever surfacing. In mediocre writing, the answer to questions like these is ""because the plot demanded it"". In awful writing (which is the territory Attack on Titan unfortunately keeps treading on) you often arrive at an unfortunate realization that the plot could have actually progressed towards the desired direction anyways, without having to sacrifice the in-world logic or the integrity of the setting.
The regular titans are sadly not really a part of S3p1 at all. All we get now are these transforming super titans. Escalating stakes and progressively stronger enemies are a mainstay of the action anime genre, but I am really sad to see my all-time favorite anime monsters reduced to basically just a slight inconvenience. This is a fanboy complaint, but S3p1 also kinda further shits on the Colossal Titan by introducing an even BIGGERER and more DANGEROUSER super titan. To me, the Colossal Titan was always the poster boy of the entire series. The image of it gazing over the wall is the first thing I think of when I hear the name ""Attack on Titan"".
Animation? Still excellent. Maybe a slight dip in quality in the middle, but no major flaws. The soundtrack? Great (all though some of the new vocal tracks I found a tad bit distracting). Voice acting? Great. Basically everything on the anime production-side is god tier. Unfortunately, it's all in the service of this story that is on it's way down a toilet and trying to hit the flush.",5

                (May contain some minor spoiler)
Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 started approx. a year after the second season landed. With the increasing hype over time, fans are delighted to see and experience more about Eren and his team to fight against the Titans. What I like about this series is its grasp over the suspense (that other anime rarely have imo), but then again it's not flawless.
Story
For examining and adapting from the manga, it has some good aspects to it. Some changes happened, but nothing crucial or important. What I experienced is that the anime has accomplished to execute the fight scenes as good as the
                  manga, but lacks the political issues that bring the most intense atmosphere to the table.
Art
I find it pretty good, the art is consistent and well-damn prepared at its best. Nothing to talk much about here. 
Sound
The appearances of HYDE for the new opening shocked the entire world that time, but for me it's not a big deal. Both the opening and the ending are quite enjoyable, and the pretty soundtracks all along the series is again, made by Hiroyuki Sawano. What do u expect.
Character
This is when I see some minor problems. There are few aspects that SnK S3 failed to grasp, such as fulfilling certain character development. Maybe some of u will argue that it's more than enough to develop such character, but I believe the series can push it more. Not the best aspect of the series tho.
Enjoyment
It's Attack on Titan, and it's packed with a lot of surprise and fulfillment. I'm gonna give it a 8/10 for this category.
Overall
In conclusion, SnK S3 or Attack on Titan Season 3 is worth watching, IF, ONLY IF, you watch the first 2 seasons. Please, if you want to watch this series, go watch those two first. For u that haven't read the manga and haven't watch those 2, I suggest to not read the manga and watch them instead. You'll be hooked entirely by it.",8

                Story: 9
Attack on Titan's story is masterful, *especially* in this season. The way the plot progresses in Season 3 is really well done. It tosses out clues that tease answers to every mystery in the series and feeds them to the viewer one drop at a time. The anime is so full of cliffhangers and half-reveals it made me hunger for every next episode the same way Sasha lusts for a big slab of ham. Seasons 1 and 2 had that intense layer of suspense too, but it's only in Season 3 where we FINALLY get a satisfying payoff. What really happened in that flashback
                  Eren had of his father erasing his memories? Who was Levi before he joined the Survey Corps? Why can some Titans produce crystal from their bodies while most Titans can't? How do people turn into Titans? How do people become Titan shifters? All of these questions and more get answered in Season 3. There's still many, many very big mysteries yet to be uncovered in the world of AoT, but this season takes a big step closer to the truth. 
Another thing I love about Season 3 is its themes and messages. Not only is this season amazing because of its gripping action, but because of its depth as well. It continues Season 2's big theme of making tough choices, but it focuses more on some new ideas, like living for your own self-happiness, understanding what makes people special, the mix of good and bad in everyone, and the moral dilemma of killing people. So there's plenty of thought-provoking stuff in S3 too.
Art: 9
The animation in Season 3 is top-notch. Every battle is beautifully animated and thrillingly depicted. Levi's crazy aerial maneuvers are dizzying and the Titan battles are glorious and rich with wonderful detail. Seeing the horrifying new Titan designs in Season 3 was a treat in itself.
My only problem with the art is that they used CGI for the shots of the bigger Titans and it doesn't look very good... but the animators did try to hand-draw as many closeup shots for those Titans as they could, so that's something.
Sound: 8
Overall, I'm not an enormous fan of the AoT OSTs. A lot of the action OSTs are good, but just don't fit my taste. But I *did* like the opening and ending songs. The opening might catch you off guard because it's not rousing and patriotic like Sasageyo and Guren no Yumiya, but more bittersweet and affectionate. It took me a few episodes before I really started to like it, so give it a few more listens if it rubs you the wrong way the first couple of times you hear it. The two previous openings were all about the fighting, sacrifice, and determination in Attack on Titan, but this one represents the companionship and the sadness of loss that are also a big part of the anime.
The sound effects are also good. The guns, the 3D maneuvering gear, the explosions, everything sounds pretty realistic.
Character: 9
The characters are really well developed, too. Historia becomes pretty much the main character for a significant portion of the arc and her growth as a character- and her full backstory- were both really interesting to see, even though I didn't really care about her in the last season. Also, since Season 3 involves a lot of clashes between people there's a whole moral dilemma that a lot of the members of the Survey Corps are forced to face: whether or not they are willing to kill humans instead of titans. This gets even more intriguing because so many of the enemies of our main cast actually get development, so you actually kind of feel for them when they die. Even the merchant from the first season, and his son, go down an interesting character arc that was pretty surprising to see in an anime. All in all, the story fleshes out the characters in this season very deftly.
Enjoyment: 10
The sheer amount of hype I got from each consecutive episode blows past anything I've ever seen or read before. The series builds up a sense of mystery so teasingly I can barely hold myself back from just throwing myself into the manga and finding out what the hell is going on in this show. To be honest, I'd recommend exposing yourself to a teensy bit of spoilers just like I did accidentally. Trust me, it'll only make you even more hyped up for what's coming. (Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here. As Levi would say, it's a choice you have to make for yourself.)
Overall: 9
Attack on Titan season 3 is pretty damn good. It might not be a mind-bending masterpiece, it has its flaws, but it's such a treat to watch that I have to consider this anime one of my favorites.",9
"
                I enjoyed this far more than I expected.
Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3! Finally, the season I've been waiting for. Well, as a non-manga reader this season was amazing. With the release of season two, I was a bit underwhelmed that it didn't explain much, but just put me further into the dark. I was honestly not even looking forward to this season, that is until I saw the first few episodes. The insight on the world that has been teased at us for so long has finally had some light shed on it, and it's never looked better. We know so much more from this
                  season alone it would be an understatement to call it the best season in terms of story development. With slice of comedy added here, and the interesting twists, this season is a wild ride.
Without spoiling much, the characters really have grown up since we first saw them during their training. Eren and the crew really have matured even in the small time frame that everything has taken place. Many people dislike the characters because of the ""lack of development"" but honestly, I like the fact that they haven't changed much, rather then just growing up. Personally, it gives a sense of realism that really fits in this particular show.
Overall I really don't want to spoil much since this season is still kinda new. But I personally loved this season far more than the last. There's so much more story development and the characters really show their mature side this time around. The animation and sound are both still amazing.
I highly recommend this season to anyone who has been following this anime.",9
"
                So...I’m reviewing this a lot sooner than I expected. 
As some of you may know, Attack on Titan Season 3 was originally billed as a two-cour season, similar to the first season which premiered way back in 2013. However, following episode twelve, it was revealed that the season would be split cour, with the second half set to air in Spring of 2019.
This review should have come sooner, but I’m having trouble typing since I’m suffering nasty from Titan-Slaying withdrawal. 
Attack on Titan is going to be a hard show for me to review, because I love it so much to the point where I’m
                  sure the show really isn’t THAT good, but the hype gets me pumped so much that I can see no wrong and I’ll be screaming “Sasageyo!” as Mikasa cuts the nape or achilles heel of some giant titan. I like to call this Shounen Hype Syndrome. It’s the same thing that made me see DBS as absolutely amazing even though looking back, it had quite a few rough spots.
So yeah, a bit of bias, no problem though.
After the the jaw-droppingly awesome second season, I feel that season three (or rather, this half of season three), dialed it back a bit, but I still think it was a bit better than the first season. The stakes were still high, the revelations weren’t as insane as the second season’s but still great, and the fights were as great as ever. While Titan Eren wasn’t utilized that much, it’s a bit of a refresher because it shows that Attack on Titan can still have marvelous fights while not relying too much on Titan vs. Titan.
I’ve been told that Attack on Titan has a distinct shift where it starts being more of a thriller and human vs. human as opposed to the bleak Man vs. Nature conflict of the beginning of the first season. I can kind of see it here: the first antagonist of the season is Kenny the Ripper - an infamous serial killer who, along with his task force, is tasked with taking out the scouts who are caught up in a smear campaign. The fact that their equivalent of the ODM gear is specifically made to fight humans instead of Titans drives this point home. While I can start seeing the series shifting, it feels naturally and doesn’t seem like it betrays what makes AoT what it is. If you loved season 1 and 2, you’ll love 3.
(You probably won’t love the opening though, that’s just bad. Here’s to hoping they change it for the next cour.)
In general, backstories seem to be the focal point of season three so far. I personally think they’re handled well. I was more invested in these backstories than Ymir’s in season two, even though I acknowledge that her’s was really important to the plot. They just seem to compliment the present action very well.
One thing that I took notice of was that the main trio was out of focus, a bit. Naturally, Eren got the most screen time of the three, but Mikasa and Armin seemed just like they were warming the bench. I hope they’re up to bat in the second cour. Though, this isn’t too much of a problem - AoT has a large cast of characters and I cared about them now more than ever.
Episodes were still fast-paced and were over in the blink of an eye, making me want more and then lamenting that I had to wait a week for the next episode.
While, again, the action and revelations weren’t as good as season 2, this season was amazing in its own right.
Production is still top-notch. Characters look great and action is fluid. It’s part of the reason that I’m not that upset over the hiatus. As they say, it’s not easy being beautiful, and if it takes half a year for Wit Studio to give us more quality episodes, I will wait.

"
                The best first half to a season you’ll ever see
Where can I possibly begin. This entire season is consistently outstanding from start to finish. There is no slowing down, no breaks just relentless quality that little anime can compare.
The animation in this....wow. This half contains quite possible my favourite animated action scene I have ever seen and it gives you it within the first handful of episodes.  It takes ODM animation to another level and throughout it never lets you down.
The characters grow in a controlled and progressive way and with every passing episode the Attack on Titan world gets steadily bigger.  The
                  story does a wonderful job of delivering a political edge that has sustained from the previous season all the through to it final scene of part 1. Through this more political story and quite frankly breathtaking action the realisation that this is one of the best anime’s you will is cemented.
This season also takes significant steps in its plot reveals blowing the story wide open. There is a particular scene towards the latter latter episodes that leaves you stunned. You really have to take a moment and take in what’s just happened and it’s nothing short of perfect.
I will remember the first time I watched this half season for the rest of my life. It is bold, brilliant and bloody fantastic. An absolute triumph.",10

While not yet featuring the ""big reveal"" every AOT fan is waiting for, this season freaking kicks you in the stomach with the best character development in the entire series.

"
                The first half of Attack on Titan Season 3 is, without a doubt in my mind, the worst 12 episode stretch of the entire series to date. It's slow, boring, bloated with talking and severely lacking in action and honestly it feels like we're watching a different show entirely. As opposed to humans against titans we're now watching humans against humans and a boring political intrigue subplot. The first and only titan fight in the entire first half of this season does not occur until 8 or 9 episodes in and then when it finally does the titan is fought almost entirely with cannons/artillery and
                  is only fought for a few brief moments- just enough to land the killing blow- by actual humans.
I understand that the intended structure of this season is part one is the buildup and part two is the payoff, but in this case the buildup was way too slow and boring, there's way too much of a difference between the quality and engagement level of part one and part two and the pacing of this season as a whole is just a mess. As a whole, there's simply way too much exposition dump/information overload in this season. It introduces way too many characters and plot points and key pieces of information at once. Not only is it a complete overload making it overwhelming and hard to follow, but it's spaced out pretty terribly in such a way where you're either getting way too much information in a short time or you're getting no information at all. There's zero subtlety in this season- there's a clear ""this is where we tell you stuff"" and ""these are the action episodes we know you've been wanting"" divide going on here and it's completely unmissable. 
Honestly, if this were my first Attack on Titan experience I would not have continued with the show and likewise if I weren't such a HUGE fan of the series, as reflected by my perfect 10/10 score for season one, the first half of season three would have been bad enough for me to have dropped the series outright.

                F's REVIEW:
As the opening of Shingeki no Kyojin's third season starts rolling, we notice a huge tonal difference to introduce the series: we see images of characters living their respective childhoods, memories of their families and ""smooth"" days. But even more important than what's being showed, it's what isn't: there's no titan wrecking bodies in sight. You see, I always thought the ""problem"" of Shingeki no Kyojin was the resorting to gore and violence to compose its ambience instead of minor and quotidian details that, undoubtedly, strengthens that universe more effectively. This third season seems to be quite aware of that. 
That said, we're led
                  to 12 episodes that value the bonds between the characters as well as the world in which they inhabit, becoming possible a scope of their experiences and personalities in a way that the previous seasons could never. I know that with this it may look like the series' problem for me is its' main plot, a.k.a the titans. Quite on the contrary, I always advocated the presence of the titans and the whole cosmos they bring with them as something extremely valuable and innovative for the genre (more as a dystopian futurist than as a shonen), but the approach on this subject in many of the previous episodes were just a mess.
Here, at least, we have more cohesive situations, aiming less on a sentimental and threatening physical action (which it has given us, in this anime, countless mushy gestures of hysteria and, mainly, bad screenplay if we remember the many characters who were introduced and killed in the same episode just to keep that unbearable horror flux active), but even so, that don't give up that energy that surrounds the narrative. When the protagonists just take their time to think about their own attitudes about the completion of a mission in the first episodes, we have a sign of growth both on those involved as on the screenplay itself regarding its approach. Effectively, the melodrama key turns to drama and the burden they carry is much more depurated in favor of a discomfort and horror adjacent to that reality than that worthless and explicit violence we've hopefully moved on. 
These gestures that builds these relations are given time enough to occupy the majority of this season's episodes, and this brings us closer to an experience. A friend told me once that he knows he truly appreciated a show when he feels like ""living in that universe"". Shingeki no Kyojin provides these bittersweet moments, until we remember that there are titans eating people circling those walls. Turning this information in a latent memory is the best pace the anime got in a long time. It means that our intelligence wasn't underestimated at all, allowing us to have our own judgement about the related events. 
Of course, the use of history as a science and the social institutions help to set the tone for this evolution, being these the details I've always said were the most important factors on building that society confined in walls. Maybe these representations were not so effective since they were delivered raw and explicit, providing small spaces for subtext or personal readings from each viewer, but it's in this season that these elements find their peaks as metaphors. 
Maybe, with so many positive aspects (in comparison to previous seasons), only 12 episodes may be a hindrance. I mean, in so many episodes we get to see so many things happening with so many informations that I got the impression that they intended to hush this ""easy-going"" season full of origin stories by compilating them as much as possible. Which I particularly think it's a shame, since these episodes got more material and potential for a solid and less urgent narrative than the 25 episodes from season 1. However, the reaction as a whole was closer to a positive one than the opposite, even more when I take into account the depth the show aims at by taking time for a development both on the central as on the peripheral characters. (That is, apart from Eren. I really can't understand how the anime has such a hard time to cut its own protagonist out from the extremes: his nuances resemble more a wrecking ball than a pendulum).
In conclusion, the sci-fi ambience reaches new proportions by including in such a natural way the fantastic on its ""nods"" to the answers we're expecting from the anime. All the diegetic past we had access to in this season was capable of filling some of the blanks with informations and events of value. And it's only stimulating that the characters are getting as intereting as the universe they live in. Time did good to the show, so the expectation for the next steps are absolutely positive.

P's REVIEW:
Succintly sayin', the fist half of season 3 of Shingeki no Kyojin is almost a masterpiece. I mean... when the show starts, it's clear things will be different, focusing on the characters' background and not on that violent and war nauseating appeal regarding the titans.
There's so little that prevent this anime from being perfect: Mikasa's submissive personality to Eren is something that always bothered me, and the protagonist itself who's such a pain in the ___. At least, here, he gets less screen time.

"
                This was disappointing, I loved season 1 and liked season 2 even if the payout was a little lower, but this time the payout is very very low. New characters are introduced and side characters developed for a new royalty story arc, but compared to the drama of living in a world of titans this is lackluster in terms of intensity. What I liked about season one was the sheer intensity of it, many encounters with titans, the forest being pretty hype, how under-powered the humans are compared to titans, but in this season 3 you have very little of that. While season 2 hinted
                  at a titan city that the armored titan and huge titan wanted to go back to, we see barely anything of that here. 
Another major point is the disappointing sound and music. The ambient music is barely audible, the battle music is also nothing to write home about, we see a fight versus a giant titan but he is dispatched fairly easily by the scouts who are now fearless and ponder upon their feelings when a thousand ton titan is breathing into their neck 10 feet away from them. While season 1 had plenty of intense fight and season 2 had a few, here we have a couple that leave you pondering what the hell is happening but not in a good way. 
The character design has changed somewhat, the eyes of the characters seem bigger and ""glassy"". The opening theme is very disapointing, where the season 1 one is iconic, this seem to have been made by people who havent seen season one or two. Also, another new character, Levi's mentor, is introduced, but it doesnt add anything new to either the titan or royalty plotline, he just happen to be some dude who's good at killing people and work for a conspiracy but surprise he has a relationship with the king from the past...zzz 
Anyway, while season two hinted at new animal titans, the emotional development of the two scouts turned titans and the mysterious titan city, we have no closure in those 12 episodes.  This is backstory season, and not only that, the background very quiet and almost annoying music doesnt help to deliver it. Honestly, if the character art hadnt changed to being weird-like and the music's intensity and volume been tuned up to 11, this might have been easier to watch, but sadly this isnt the case.
Well, at least I heard season 3 part 2 is better!",5
"
                This was EASILY the weakest season of Attack On Titan of the three.  Easily.  However, because AoT is awesome, it's still good and entertaining, but in comparison to its usual level of suspense, action and excellence, this season was a far cry from the previous seasons.  My biggest complaint is the backstory of the Reiss family.  Honestly, it just was kind of a letdown, as it exposes to some extent the origins of the Titans, and although it hasn't fleshed out fully, it looks like it's going to be pretty cliche.  I was hoping for more of a mystery or
                  something different.   
My second problem with this season is the fact that they scaled back on the deaths.  AoT, for me, is an anime that gives you a feeling of hopelessness and despair, as you watch the heroes be trapped like rats with death coming for them at any time.  That was strongly missing in this season.  I see this anime sort of like the Walking Dead (Back when it was good) and you never knew who was going to go or how, so I could kind of vicariously live through the situation thinking: ""How can I survive?""  That was ripped out with all of the jumping back and forth through the past to explain the backstory of Levi, Kenny, Eren, Historia and the Reiss Family.  
I just didn't care much about Rod Reiss, to be honest.  And honestly, the entire final battle fell flat on its face to me. (pun intended).  Another thing I didn't care for was the intro.  Man, that was the worst intro music I've ever heard for an anime like this.  It looked more like an intro into a romance/drama anime, than a gory, action-survival anime.  It was terrible.  
With that being said, even though this was the worst season of AoT, it's still AoT, so it has a lot of good moments in it, too.  The battles that did happen throughout the anime were good, especially when Levi and his men would battle Kenny and his.  Kenny The Ripper was a good villain.  Probably the most interesting human villain in the anime so far.  And while the Reiss family backstory wasn't all that great, the palace intrigue angle with Erwin was very good and saved the anime.  
Also, the animation and production was improved this season.  It was definitely a cut above previous seasons.  And, as usual, the cast is strong, especially Levi, Mikasa, Henge and Erwin.  But, I experienced something new in the final episode.  Even though this was the worst of the seasons, what happened during the ending song, makes me more hyped to see Season 4 than ever before.  DO NOT SKIP THE ENDING CREDITS ON THE FINAL EPISODE.   That 30 second moment makes a kind of ""meh"" finish end with: ""Holy crap! What the hell?!""  Don't miss it.

                Attack on Titan season three was very interesting, at least the first twelve episodes of the first half of it. The secrets and mysteries that surrounded the high government officals as well as part of levi's past exciting to know about, I like it because it's more so about espionage instead of just hacking and slashing, like it normally is. The conspiracy of the walls goes deeper then anyone could have ever imagine including the scouts, who are shocked to find out some of that so called ""crucial"" information regarding important facts of the walls. But, despite their backs being against the walls, the scouts
                  still, stand firm and strong, and fight for their very own survival as well as, the lives of their comrades, to uncover the whole truth that the government is trying to both cover up and keep silent for good, by whatever means possible.",10

                this is not a good show by it's own merits. the story is alright, it has enough twists that you cant predict everything that's going to happen so it never runs into the problem with fairy where you will just keep skipping episodes. for the most part the art is quite pretty, it does lack in some areas and can occasionally take you out of the scene but generally their are lots of breath taking visuals and soothing backgrounds typical of this show. the sound and characters are, average at best some times, the characters tend to fluctuate from hilariously bad to pretty convincingly written,
                  but overall i had a blast watching this show. i cant say its very good but i can say i enjoyed it so i will. i don't know what it is about this edgy hype train it has all the turn offs for someone who likes his shows to think a little deeper but i guess I've kinda fallen for the premise again. somewhere along the line i fell out of love with this series and couldn't get back into it when season 2 arrived, but their really is something special about this show, it's really fun to watch.",7
"
                To this day, I do not understand how anyone still alive can enjoy Attack on Titan. This is one of the worst animes I have ever seen, and I am a fucking Baki fan. This season (and series as a whole) is filled with stupid asspuls and cliches- people fly out of nowhere to save each other and do absurd shit just because they're evil or because they're good. Morality is barely even a concept, only 3 characters have displayed it, 2 of which died. Nearly every main character is a Mary Sue in some form- Eren performs absurd feats despite being a new titan
                  and never loses a single fight and can fix an entire wall and Mikasa is somehow a military genius  capable of rivaling Levi, a veteran of the scout unit. The only  interesting characters were Erwin, Bertholt, and Reiner. In all fairness, Erwin, Bertholt, and Reiner were great characters and I loved seeing them- except that Erwin and Bertolt got killed off immediately in season 3. Nothing was done with Bertolt to warrant his death. The very death of Bertolt and Erwin made me drop the show, because it's obvious they don't care about the characters and just want flashy action scenes and drama. This isn't even Attack on Titan, this is fucking K-On without the racism.",2
"
                Another amazing season (or half a season) that did pretty much everything it needed to do and provided one heck of a cliffhanger for the last half. I think I enjoyed this more than the second season, though I can't say it was perfect. Spoilers ahead.
This season starts off with a bang and is able to continue to build the momentum even during episodes that are more focused on exposition. The first two episodes absolutely blew me away with their animation and electric storytelling. Levi pops off in those episodes providing some astonishing sequences with the ODM gear, but the show also retains the gravity
                  and horror that pervades this show, not hesitating to kill scouts left and right. I love how these episodes show Levi's squad come to terms with having to kill fellow humans. 
Following the explosion of an opening, the show segues into a section largely focused on political intrigue, yet not one episodes is boring. I also really liked how the show dropped the threat of titans for a small portion to allow all the attention to be focused on the conflict between the two factions of humans fighting for control. All the mystery and intrigue is handled very well for the most part, giving the audience just enough so that it doesn't fell like we aren't being told anything. Also, the increase in Historia's role in the show was handled really well and it was able to make her an interesting character.
There are multiple episodes throughout this season where a part or a majority of it is a flashback, providing an explanation about an event or a character. The show does an amazing job at making those flashbacks feel natural and tying them into the current moment that the show is in. The flashbacks give explanations, but also expand upon the character the flashback is about, establishing one main compelling factor in their lives that is brought to the forefront in the current scene making their following actions so much more weighty and impactful. 
The final episode was very much the calm before the storm, providing just a little respite before everything falls apart as is hinted at the very end of the episode. That interruption of the ED scared me though. The static and frames cutting in and out surprised me in conjunction with the eery music and dialogue, and the scene of Levi, Eren, and Mikasa looks absolutely devastating.
As much as I liked this season, there was one main problem I had with this season that kept it from being perfect for me. Every episode worked together to create a near perfect season, except for episode 46. The conclusion to the whole Reiss family arc (if you can call it that) felt very rushed, as did Eren's development in that episode. I felt like the way they defeated Rod's titan came too easily, almost like a Saturday morning cartoon where a new villain is defeated within one episode. Of course, this isn't exactly alike, but the ending just felt a little too convenient. Also, the jump from Eren punching himself to being all gung-ho and ready to execute the mission was very abrupt with no transition, unless I missed an important scene. Also, this isn't really a gripe, but I was expecting Kenny to be a bit more dangerous and important than he ended up being in the end. I still really liked his conclusion with Levi which just about made up for my let down expectations, but I was a little disappointed he went out so quickly.
For some side notes, I liked seeing Marlo and Hitch again and it was pretty cool to see Marlo join the Scouts. Mikasa's relationship with Eren, and more specifically the way she deals with him, is so funny to me. The way she responds to him at times, and for a more specific example, the way she got mad when Eren was talking alone with Historia, are hilarious. Honestly, I didn't really care for the semi-reveal that the Ackermans are a special family that have special abilities. I was completely fine with accepting that Mikasa and Levi were both more gifted than the rest of the scouts without some sort of special explanation. Can't wait to understand more about the humans/titans outside the wall.
Overall, a near perfect season with only one slightly off episode. I'm really loving this show and I can't wait to finish season 3 and for season 4 to come out.",9
"
                Wow.
SnK's first two seasons failed to impress me. I found the story enjoyable, albeit flawed, due to the typical elements of a shounen and lack of character development for the main characters, but season 3 blew me away. I am glad I stuck with it.
This season deviates from your average shounen with a big FUCK YOU. Eren went from Naruto, a mediocre boy with monstrous power nested within, to a more mellow man with great complexity. Unlike Naruto who never questioned his talent and power, Eren has an existential and identity crisis when he realizes he is just an average man with incredible power granted
                  to him by his special father. His grapple with mediocrity vs specialness pushes him into great character development, where he finally makes peace with mediocrity and learns to put faith in himself and his comrades.
Other characters also have their moments that showcase the complexity of the writing, such as Armin, Jean, HIstoria and Levi. What I thought was lacking in other seasons is finally fulfilled in this season.
There is a lot of foreshadowing, which means the author has really thought the story through. Everything comes in a full circle. Ep 11 is a great example of this. I was blown away by the ending's revelation. Amazing. Simply amazing writing.
Season 3 marks the end of your typical action anime. SnK has officially become a political thriller and a great reflection of society in real life, where morality is mostly relative. There is no right or wrong answer to most things in life. The winner gets to decide what is moral and what is not. Our characters must stand up for what they believe, even if it means paying a hefty price. But freedom is worth it.",10
"
                NO spoilers
I've never made a review here before but after I have seen this season I feel like there's some perspectives that has to be stated.
I know that this anime is a ""baby"" for many of you (and including me) but there's some things that I miss from what they've produced before.
Let me start with the positive stuff first though.
Attack on titan is one of the most amazing animes out there and I would not continue to watch and rewatch if that wouldn't be the case.
It's stunning, the animations are really good and there's eye candy in every scene.
The plot is well made as well
                  as the story.
However - when I got hooked by this show, it wasn't just the mature and sophisticated ""gore-ish"" style.
Attack on titan provided so many feelings, I burst to tears, felt sadness, laughed, got a bit scared and had goosebumps when the action hit it's peaks.
But in this latest season, they've more or less forgot what they want to give the viewers - I'd say that they almost do not know what they're capable to do in an anime.
My feelings were more or less just plain - and sometimes filled with  boredom. 
Despite the focus on dialogue and long history explanation, I think they've failed to give us a way to feel for the show. They've been focusing so much on everything else that it more or less feels like a budget movie than an emotional rollercoaster. 
The music isn't played as it should and the theme is quite boring.
All that removes the excitement.
I hoped that I would get the insight enough to get a relation to the characters but instead they interrupted every compassionate moment with too much dialogue and plain face expressions.
I'd say that when you no longer care about Eren - then the anime has lost the core purpose.
The second important thing is what they focus on.
Many times, as well as when they try to add some humourous cuts, they don't really add the hint about if it's important or not. Sometimes you even get confused if it's supposed to be fun or important.
It's so serious right now that even when they try to make joke, you're not longer aware if it's included to the plot or just a laughable controversy.
Take it a bit further! Extend the lines!
When everything is so ""delayed"", the music theme is off and the situational feelings isn't there, me as a viewer doesn't know how I should react to that particular scene.
That's why I can't give it more than ""Good"". The expressions doesn't support the plot.
Since it's hard to keep this review out of spoilers, I can't really specify what I mean but if you keep what you read in mind, then you might understand. 
The anime isn't bad, but it doesn't feel as it used to do. I'd still recommend everyone to watch it",7
"
                Tldr; Yeah, I enjoyed Season 3 of Shingeki no Kyojin much, much more than I did while watching its Season 2. 
Everything that we as the audience had to gruelingly sit through in Season 2 was simply just the time we had to wait so that the stage was set, and we could enjoy watching how the story turns out.
This season, in particular, had all the character development we could ever ask for from the anime. And to top it off, the same opening and ending songs that were used throughout the season made me feel entirely different by the time I finished watching the
                  12 episodes in this season.
I'm glad this one covered more of what aCTUALLY happened instead of just one viewpoint, and that we got to know much more about the lore and how the kingdom works.",9
"
                Many mysteries have been answered, humans are superior now. But still without sacrifice there will be no such result. In this way, many old characters die, and more and more new characters will come. Well suited for the change of the last season. But actually I'm still confused why the wound on Mikasa's cheek hasn't disappeared either, maybe there is a certain purpose. What's more, the animation that is getting better makes it more interesting to watch, but sometimes I feel disgusted by seeing something so real like a burnt corpse. But that's AOT, I can't complain because the story is like that. What's more,
                  that's what makes the whole story even more great. It's really different from one piece where the character should be dead but not made to die, the feel is very different. And it is true that the more complicated the story is, the more interesting it is to find the answer. And for this season thanks we can see Levi in ​​more action. There are also more jokes in this season, hopefully the next season can be even better.",10
"
                Not repeating myself, read previous reviews.
Story is as good as in Season 2, even if new facts are revealed, but there's still one missing mystery to be solved.
I don't know how about other viewers, but this Season had the most beautiful and colourful scenes in whole Shingeki no Kyojin.
More new characters, including random civilians, also new personalities.
Most of people didn't enjoy this part, mostly becuase ""there were almost no titans"". But that doesn't matter, most of people still enjoy this part of Attack on Titan.
Ending is kinda epic, it hypes you for action that comes next.
              ",9
"
                AOT Seasons 3 is after the defeat of Reiner and Bertholdt and the Survey Corps very costly recapture of Eren Jaegar. This season is my least favorite season, even though my enjoyment is an 8. 
From the start you could say it has a different mood/vibe compared to the last two seasons. It was much more lighthearted and less gruesome and some moments and scenes were out of place in a world like AOT . It was unbalanced in all honesty. What made the last two seasons specials was the titan action and the human conflicts both very balanced. But season 3 focuses completlely on
                  the human part of the story such as politics. Even though it was short and definitely felt rushed it makes up for it with further detailed worldbuilding and gives us alot of answers to the questions we have been dreading since last season. But one question remains, ""Who is the enemy?"". This season certainly had more issues and flaws than compared to the last two seasons.
They did a pretty goob job on the characters in this seasons but tbh there wasn't much development for most of the characters except maybe Levi and Historia. We get alot of details on families of Levi, Mikasa, and Historia and the mysteries and the truths that they left behind. Such as who Levi's mom was or how Eren's parents met. We get a couple of new character introductions most being minor except for Kenny and Rod Reiss. Kenny, a egotistical maniac that only craves for power and is much more important than expected as we go on in the series. And Rod Reiss, an important figure to Historia and his own ""creation"" leading to his own failure. The screentime for the characters were well done for the most part though I expected some exposition from Mikasa and Armin.
The visuals are comparable to last season. But takes a dip once such as when Trost felt like an empty city. And with the animation and art feeling a bit more white/lighter, it doesn't still well with the atmosphere and tone of AOT. The opening was not as good compared season 1 or 2 but was still pretty good alone. The violin was actually used quiet alot in this season especially during the action scenes, it gave us a more subtle and calm feeling and I liked it. But with the minimum use of the choir and vocals that gave alot of energy I can't give the sound a 10
Overall a pretty enjoyable season. And has the elements and plot devices for a respectable sequel of season 2.",9
"
                I am reviewing ANIME so I won't be comparing how well it represents manga and etc.
\\ spoiler alert just in case //
Art: 9/10
Still the same cool looking action scenes and scenery.
Characters: 9/10
Major antagonist is introduced, Kenny. Once he filled father figure of Levi's, in the season he's hired to hunt Levi and our characters, even though he is quite a madman, he has his moral standards and shows his and shows his displeasement with ""execution"" of one of our MC, stating it's unfair to kill chained prisoner. He was definitively most outstanding character in this season. Otherwise it's the same crew from SnK S1 &
                  S2.
Character progression: 8/10
This season is focused on Historia Reiss family and some titan's background and we also get to see how Eren's Yaeger father got his serum on titan's transformation.
Story: 8/10
Eren. Season 3 is following Eren's attempts to reproduce Annie's ( Season 1 female titan) ability to turn into crystal in order to barricade wall Maria's hole. With some unlucky events Eren's get kidnapped and it's onto our team to save him again. Season 3 is about discovering Reiss family background and saving Eren and eventually massive ( not kidding) bossfight. In previous seasons I had problem with ""elite team"" ( go read my other SnK reviews) issue, in this season I had problem with Eren's attitude. In one certain part Eren is about get eaten, but the person who has to do it doesn't want to eat eat Eren. Instead of making that person help him Eren's desperately beggs that character to eat him. Eren, who once said that he'll eradicate every single titan now wants to die out of nowhere, this is completely out of his character.
Story progression: 8/10
Story goes pretty well with some nice ""shocking"" informations and plot twists.
Villains: 7/10
Kenny: 8/10
Once feared by every single city guard, slaughtering many, but now he works with the ""government"" in their quest to destroy Levi and our characters. Experienced killer, he was very well developed and enjoyable villain.
Rodd Reiss: 6/10
He's Historia's father, he's get some development and in later episodes he has his big moment (literally), but overall he's not really an enjoyable villain and doesn't really has any ""villain charisma"".
Sound: 9/10
Same as always SnK has fantastic opening and ending and battle music.
So overall rating of Shingeki no Kyojin Part 1 is 8,29/10 that means 8/10. It is again ""Historia"" season, but it's not bad, I enjoyed it quite a lot.",8
"
                I'm going to assume you have seen Season 1 and Season 2 before reading this.
I'm not sure how I even got this far into this anime. I started watching this series because I heard SO. MANY. PEOPLE raving about it, but honestly, I couldn't see what was so great about it (no offense if you like it! Everyone has different preferences!) 
Story 7/10 (For Attack on Titans overall. Season 3 was like maybe a 5 or 6/10)
Season 1 was ok. I rated it a 6, but it was more like a 6.5... I love the concept of the Titans, and the twist is interesting. Overall,
                  the story has a very engaging start. Oh, and the fight sequences are pretty good too!
But from there, season 2 and 3 is hovering between a 5.5 or a 6. The story for season 2 and 3 falters a bit, in my opinion. 
However, objectively speaking, I still think the story has a very interesting concept, which is why I gave it a 7. 
Characters 3/10
Ok the characters. This is actually what made me rate the show so low. I'm not a shipper and have never been into that scene, so maybe that's why I couldn't connect that well with the characters?
I just didn't vibe with the main cast of characters. Perhaps I'm missing something? But the characters felt so flat, so 2D that as I'm writing this review 3 weeks after I've seen it, I barely remember anything about the characters. To be honest, I barely remember their names. I remember Levi...? But that's only because of that scene in season 1 where he beat up the main guy. And Levi was in some pretty cool fight sequences too. 
But other than that, I didn't understand each of the character's motivations; I didn't feel connected to any of the characters; I didn't feel for any of the characters. 
Art 5/10
Objectively speaking, the art style of Attack on Titans is really clean, and I can understand why a lot of people may like it. The Titans are seriously one of my favorite animated characters drawn. 
The 5/10 is more for the fact that I personally don't like the really heavy dark lines on the characters. It's hard to explain, but some of the scenes with the characters were extremely crude. The heavy dark lines coupled with deep shadows created very harsh animation.
Again, this is a personal preference, and I'm not commenting on the execution of the animation. 
Sound 7/10
Great music!! Iconic. Not much else to say about that!
Enjoyment 6/10
Like I said, I really enjoyed the concept of the story. The execution fell flat for me, but it's still a fairly entertaining show to watch. Ultimately, what killed it for me was the lack of good characters.
So if you're just curious or really want some good action/fight sequences, give this a little watch. 
Overall 6/10
I probably am not going to bother watching the last season, but might do it if I have nothing else to watch.",6
"
                Wow! Just...WOW! After a disappointing (to me, at least) Season 2, Attack on Titan roars back into my heart with the speed of a Levi-attack in ODM gear!
The Season 3 opening is a visual pastiche of melancholy, a bittersweet reflection, set to a surprisingly upbeat tune, and we see just how far our heroes have come, while also giving us glimpses into the background/psyche/makeup of other characters, like Erwin, Levi, and Christa/Historia.
Minor Spoiler: during the opening credits, there's a scene where a happy child/Eren runs and bumps into a stoic soldier/Eren. Soldier/Eren doesn't react, as child/Eren dances joyfully around soldier/Eren, laughing and waving to get
                  his attention. It's fairly ""meta,"" but it really sets to tone for the season.
In addition to the Shiganshina Trio, we get more screen-time and exposition with Erwin, Levi and Hange, and it feels like ALL the characters, like Connie, Sasha, and Jean, are being a part of a real team, even as the story unfolds and grows more complex and twisted.
Production values remain high; art, motion, music, and with vastly improved story-telling technique over Season 2, Season 3 sets a very high bar.",9
"
                SnK Season 3 (Part 1) has a pretty different vibe and pacing from it's surrounding seasons. This works well in some ways, less in others...and the season packs in some outstanding moments.
It's clear from the start that this season will focus on more human conflict; for the first couple of episodes I was worried that this was going to a frustrating distraction from the 'main' conflict; fortunately this isn't the case. It actually allows us to get - FINALLY - the beginnings of some explanations.
The plot actually does a complete 180° to what the plot of season 2 was doing: while in season 2 a
                  lot of time was spent giving us no real exposition, only leaving the viewer more confused, in many episodes of season 3 there is a whole lot of exposition given very quickly. I found myself pausing frequently during some scenes to make sure I was fully keeping up with what was being explained. And while, yes, this is preferable and more satisfying, I think it does reveal the one significant weakness of the anime which is just an issue with pacing. It's not an issue that ruins the show by any means; it just holds it back from being really perfect.
I enjoyed watching Erwin's plans in episode 5, it was smart and gratifying to see, but I do think it maybe happened a little too quickly; not that I would wish for the pace of the show to slow down, I just thought it made things look a bit too simple.
I also have to say I found it a little frustrating that Eren gets kidnapped so early in the season when it feels like he was only just recovered at the end of season 2...it's not a huge gripe, it just gave him a bit of a 'damsel in distress' vibe for a while there.
The human focus of this season has the major upside of some fantastic character moments and development. Highlights are: seeing Levi back in action and learning a fair bit about his past, the squad wrestling with the morality of killing and torture, Eren's tragic guilt, Erwin's smart gambles, and best of all: Historia's moment in episode 7. She was a character that I truly didn't care about at all until that moment, but she really blossoms in this season and becomes a character to admire. The moment is not only her highlight, but really a highlight of the whole show, and it allows the story to overcome the trap of being a cynical tragedy, but rather a story of human hope and resistance. I really loved it!
The OST is pretty much the same quality as other SnK seasons: fine. Pretty good, not that memorable. The opening this season is also pretty good as always, but not in the top rankings of them. I've continued to watch the Japanese audio and I have no complaints.
There's nothing new to say about the art of the show: it's stellar. The action sequences are as thrilling as ever. Of particular note is the design of the main titan this season; even by SnK's standards I thought it was horrifying.
Overall, this was an intriguing season; it provided a more satisfying story than the previous season. While the main titan battle was pretty cool, it was a bit lacking in titan action. I think that much like season 2 it's almost reaching perfection, held back by only a few shortcomings. But's it's almost there...and the final episode does get you very pumped for the second part of the season.",9
"
                Attack on Titan's Final Season is less than one month away and my rewatch marathon finally reached the point where the truth starts to come out. Season 3 plot has an entirely different tone for the anime, presenting new themes and threats disguised as new sadistic characters, corrupt governments, false kings, and...almost no titans.
This season reveals A LOT of new information about the mysteries of this world, and it's not a simple plot twist that surprises you and then moves on. This new information changes the future of the story in some really interesting ways. As I said above, this season has almost no titans,
                  and the main enemies this time are humans. Normal humans. And the focus of the plot is the current fragile state of the civilization inside the walls, being controlled under a corrupt government that is determined to keep the secrets of the real world from the population. A very unexpected turn of events, if you asked me the first time I watched this season. 
While the secrets revealed in this season conform some of the highest points in the anime so far, this season has also some of the lowest points. For starters, the way the plot is introduced is very repetitive: Eren gets kidnapped for the third time. And it's not just a momentarily kidnapping like in the previous seasons. The whole plot revolves around the squad finding Eren, and it's a bit repetitive. The pace was also off sometimes. A bit rushed during some episodes (compared to the manga) and a bit slow in others, especially in the final three epilogue episodes.
The more grounded plot gave also some interesting development for some characters. Like in the previous season, Historia gets more focus in this season and becomes a VERY important part of the story, revealing her past and the involvement of her family with the current state of the world. Levi and Erwin also get some interesting backstories that play an important part in this and the next season, and Eren is not the same annoying kid from season one anymore. And since the enemies are humans, the rest of the cast get to make some moral decisions that change them, like killing or torturing people and becoming fugitives.
The quality of the animation and sound is as good as usual. BUT the soundtrack of this season might be my least favorite of the anime so far. Sure, it uses some old songs we already heard in previous seasons. But the new songs introduced here are not as epic and emotional as Counter Attack, Ocean Eyes, Youseegiggirl, or Apetitan, and they lack something compared to those I mentioned. Plus, there are two new songs that don't fit at all with AoT:  K21 (a frenetic orchestral song with English rap on top of it), and Zero Eclypse (a song that sounds as if it was sung by Christina Aguilera). They could have used orchestral versions of songs they already used before, like Barricades instead of Zero Eclypse, since it's Historia's theme, and it would have sounded a lot better. But still, they at least used some of the songs right and hyped up some other scenes (like the final scene with the Survey Corps).
Also, the opening song for this season is very different from the usual songs. Instead of having an epic orchestral rock anthem, we have a slower, warmer song with a more emotional and nostalgic tone. It's not bad, but it kind of does not fit with the serious tone this season had. At least the credit song was made by Linked Horizon, and it is the best credit song so far.
The tone for this season was more serious than the others, but it had some minor comedy moments than didn't fit at all, and only made some characters look like cartoons. So for someone who doesn't like forced comedy like myself, it was a bit annoying.
All in all, this season of Attack on Titan takes a rest from the usual conflict with the titans, changing its focus with an interesting plot and revealing some major secrets that expand this world even more. It might feel like a completely different story, but it's a pretty good interlude and prelude for what comes next.",8
"
                I´ll be honest: I kind of dropped out of the fandom at some point after the plot in the manga has turned overly political. From that point I did not take much interest in the story, putting it on hold for indefinite amount of time. 
So what changed?
Well, I saw Levi's chase making-of at some animation group and have been completely captivated as it had one of the craziest framing and animation quality I have ever seen. I have been so stunned that when I decided to watch the anime and the fateful moment came, I repeated the sequence five times to fully grasp its
                  dazzle. But it was not the end: as soon as Levi's background plot started to unveil, another amazing sequence followed - an ingenious fight between Levi and his former caretaker, Kenny. But I won't say more - it is something you have to see on your own to fully understand what makes Attack on Titan so special. Some might say the fight scenes are cliche Spider-man swinging, but in my opinion western animation will never get to that level. 
This sole aspect is enough for me to appreciate the anime and give it a sound 8. Only 8 though, because even though thrilling and exhilarating at its best, it suffers from occasional drops of tension which cannot be overlooked or, on the contrary, it starts to live off its own legend, unable to surpass its own limits (eg. opening sequence, which is build on exactly the same editing tricks and construction as the previous ones).
The other significant inconvenience is that Hiroyuki Sawano is not even trying to be original and the soundtrack does not provide an appropriate music framework to equal the intensity of animation. Historia's song sounded well in anime, but on the soundtrack it's just an overly extended track that is neither a song nor soundtrack piece. It subtracts resonance from it significantly.
8/10 with two hearts for Levi's chase and crystal chapel fight sequence.",8

                In this season of Attack on the Government, Mikasa and her family have learned the secret to become based and redpilled, Eren, in a bout of insanity said things such as ""trans right"" or ""a human killing another human is a crime"", Levi learns that he can no longer get away from mass murder, Erwin does things that aren't war crimes, Zachary made BDSM mandatory and Historia became one of the characters of all time.
The plot shifted away from action and tall people to become some sort of political cat and mouse, which is probably why I was so bored when I watched it first
                  time around, or it was Eren crying like a bitch combined with the fact that it was hard to find episodes.
Regardless, as usual, where Attack on Titans stands out is in the smaller details, and, as usual, it delivered the same quality, although it remains inferior to season 2",8
"
                Of all the Shingeki no Kyojin's seasons, this, for me, is the best in all the spects. The story is fluent, almost all the episodes ends with a lot of suspense, the characters start to evolve. The secrets of the Real Family and the Titans are appearing one by one, the dosis of intensity in each episode is perfect. They are making this more epic than ever. 
The sountrack is out of this world, and the change in the graphic art is very notable, a nice and pleasant improve.  
The end of the season is simply epic, and waiting for the 2nd part of
                  the season will be a pain in your hearts, but it will worth it, just outstanding!",9

                Attack on Titan S3 was different than the other seasons. Instead of the Human vs Titan aspect, it was Human vs Human. In the beginning you can see the Survey Corps taking on criminals. Also, another aspect was added where more enemies came. We learn more about Eren’s powers and the Royal Family. Historia plays a big role in this season as well. Eren is captured again but a big villain approaches and it is really surprising who it is. I was just confused on some parts of the story with the villains, but the villains are only a part of that season so I’m
                  not worried about it.",8
"
                Attack on Titan Season 3 picks up with an interesting start that poses an interesting question: we know the titans are a threats, but what if the real threat is within the walls themselves? The direction within this season shifts and we really get to focus on the inner mechanisms that make this government run. along with the corruption within. This season contains one of the most well animated and visually stunning sequences I've ever seen within an anime, which instantly sold me on this Season. The only complaint I have is an anticlimactic ending, but that's easily forgiven as this is only the FIRST
                  Part of Season 3, and the antagonist here was never going to be the long-term antagonist for the Season. Even so, it satisfied, and this Season is definitely up there with Season 1 in terms of quality.",9
"
                <Potential Spoilers>
There’s a lot of new stuff to go through.
This first part of Attack on Titan season three takes a break from fighting titans. It draws from the themes of war and sacrifice of the first season, and combines the world building of season two. Creating a fresh entry in the Attack on Titan story, with Wit studios animation and some more focus on building up characters.
I mentioned earlier that at this point in the Attack on Titan story, the cast have stopped fighting titans and are forced to fight humans. A dilemma that I love, as these soldiers have seen the worst of humanity
                  and understand the consequences of sacrificing human life. So when they are forded to kill human life, they question their morality throughout the series. You see the unfair treatment of the Survey Corp in the government, it’s clear that they have the most dangerous and most horrific job in the military. Yet they are discriminated against the most and paid the least. We see the government disband the survey Corp and frame them for crimes they didn’t commit. We consistently see themes of corruption, morality, and the lengths to which the government will commit unlawful acts to keep themselves in charge. The world building in this season is a vast improvement from the world building of season one and two. We get a slight more detailed understanding of the titans and their origin, a look into how the walls were created and the outside world. However, we still aren’t given enough to fully answer these questions. Allowing for the series to lead on viewers to keep on watching.
The sound design of season three part one is a definite downgrade from the previous two seasons. The sound design itself is still as great as ever, whether it’s standard sound effects or the sound of ODMG it’s still got good sound effects. The voice acting is brilliant, we have brilliant performances from several different characters in this new season. However, the soundtrack is what lags down the other sound categories in this first part of season three. By no means is it horrible, as it does sound and feel like music from the Attack on Titan world. While also conveying the basic emotions of any scene. It’s just that the soundtrack of season one and two are so much more recognisable and iconic. The Red Swan opening is a horrific downgrade. I don’t care about the visuals or symbolism in the opening. It’s a series that shows the bleak fight against human corruption and this opening feels like it’s the opening for a high school drama.
I’ve said once that the animation that Wit studios produced was arguably so good that when the studios changed for season four, there was an uproar of pissed fans. While I do believe Mappa’s work on season four was outstanding, Wit also has some animation that is top tier. Characters seamlessly blend into the environments even if the environments are cgi, the environments themselves are animated near flawlessly. The crystal caves, the rural setting of the world, the towns within the walls, all feel so detailed and alive. Wit studios truely shines with their action scenes. Whether it’s the battle against Rod Reiss, the fight in the crystal caves or the Levi fight against the military police brigade. All the action scenes were animated at a top tier level.
Characters like Historia, Eren, Erwin and Levi are given more of a chance to shine during season three. The new Levi squad works together and seeing them work in one of their toughest positions is something that really shows the bonds between the cast. Eren learns more about his Titan ability and the whereabouts of his father. Historia learns the truth of her family and completes her character arc in this season. We see Levi act as a true leader and bring everyone together, he’s the realistic character who understands it’s either do or die. Erwins reasoning behind his motives and his true character are further explained in more depth. Making his character far more interesting then a simple smart guy in a position of power. Majority of characters receive a lot more depth and complexity, allowing for characters to further evolve from their first appearances in season one. The introduction of Kenny was groundbreaking, to see a force that is more terrifying then Levi is something we haven’t really seen in Attack on Titan. His presence gives a level of true fear, as before you could easily say Levi could save everyone. But at that time, there was a force stronger when Levi that was against the main cast. The main problem being that they don’t expand on this character stronger then Levi past part one of season three.
Despite a slight downgrade in sound design, the fresh narrative, the return of Wit studios animation, and the return of memorable characters made this season something I could truely enjoy.
Overall, I rank this 8/10.",8
"
                Note: This will be a review of both parts of season 3. It will also contain a couple of spoilers for the first two seasons and will assume you’ve read my review for the first two seasons.
Overview:
Ever since the first season aired back in 2013, expectations for exactly where the immensely popular dark fantasy series ""Attack on Titan"" was going to go had been set incredibly high. Fortunately, since then that itch has not only been scratched, but massaged to the point that it’s practically non-existent, not only by the 12-episode second season, but also by this 22-episode third season, the latter of which manages
                  to tear apart everything we thought we knew about the show's world while still keeping everything that makes the first two seasons so amazing. This in turn makes it an absolute must-watch for fans, who are very unlikely to be disappointed by what this season manages to deliver.
Story & World (10/10):
While this most likely goes without saying, I would definitely say that you should watch the first two seasons before attempting this one, as while not forgotten, the events of those two seasons aren't referenced all that much, particularly since a lot of what we thought we knew during those seasons has turned out to be false. In any case, here's the basic summary of how things go; the season is split into two parts, each of which covers an arc of the manga. The first 12 episodes covers the Uprising arc, which, as the name suggests, focuses on an uprising against the ruler of the Walls, a mysterious figure who apparently has knowledge of the world of ""Attack on Titan"" that nobody else possesses. The remaining 10 episodes cover the Return to Shiganshina arc, which features the long-awaited return to Wall Maria and Eren, Mikasa and Armin's hometown of Shiganshina, where they and the rest of the Survey Corps hope to uncover the mysteries contained within the basement of the Yeager home.
""Attack on Titan"" is well-known for its masterful storytelling, and this season easily lives up to that reputation. This is especially impressive since it tells a very different story from the first two seasons without deviating too much from the formula, putting a greater emphasis on world-building and politics while still maintaining the show's excellent action. The plot of the series is constantly moving forward, to the point that I never once felt bored when watching and was eager to see what happened episode after episode. What makes this season so different from the previous seasons is that, as established in the very first episode, Titans are no longer the Corps' only enemy; in fact, the majority of the first half of the season pits them solely against other humans, many of whom oppose them for understandable reasons, with the Titans being relegated to the background, though they come back into focus in the second half. This change was already built up back in the second season, which revealed the conflict of the series to be far more complex than a simple showdown between humans and monsters, and this season follows up on that build-up brilliantly, providing a change to the series that feels natural and very much for the better.
However, the true draw of the story isn't the changes made at the very beginning, but how it evolves over the course of the season. ""Stunning revelations"" barely begins to describe what is uncovered during this season, particularly during the second half, which provides twists too numerous to list, which when combined end up altering not only the entire story, but the entire genre of the series itself. All of this culminates in a truly fantastic cliffhanger that will leave viewers incredibly eager to see where the series is going to go next. In short, not only has this season managed to maintain the momentum of the show's story, if anything it's raised the bar even higher than before, something I previously didn't even think was possible.
Art & Animation (10/10):
Once again, Wit Studio have managed to make “Attack on Titan” one of the best-looking anime you will ever see. The distinct art style has aged amazingly, and character and environments look about as realistic as you can possibly get with Japanese animation. That being said, there are a couple of occasions when CG becomes very obvious, most notably with the Colossal Titan, though I didn’t think this was too big of a deal. “Attack on Titan” has always been partially CG, after all. Overall, I will admit that the visuals are a step back in comparison to the first two seasons but not by much, or at least not to the extent that makes any real difference.
Sound & Dialogue (10/10):
Yet another thing this season manages to maintain from the first two is the phenomenal soundtrack. As a matter of fact, this soundtrack is the biggest reason as to why Hiroyuki Sawano is easily one of my favourite Japanese composers, if not my favourite full stop. Of all the many amazing tracks, however, the one that stood out for me the most is, without a doubt, “Red Swan”, the opening to the first half of the season. At first, you may find yourself wondering why such a song is even in this series, but as you listen to it more and more and the season goes on, you’ll realise just how fitting it is, and it’s an absolutely beautiful song to boot. As good as the music is, however, there is one particular episode in the second half that features no music whatsoever- and I mean “none”, even the opening is skipped-, a decision that works extremely well as it perfectly emphasises the bleakness of the current situation and the incredibly hard choice that must be made. The voice acting is excellent as well, which for me is saying a lot since this is one of the very few anime I watch subbed only. Whether it’s Yuki Kaiji as Eren, Yui Ishikawa as Mikasa, Hiroshi Kamiya as Levi or Shiori Mikami as Historia, every seiyu delivers their lines perfectly and always manages the right emotion at the right time.
Characters (9.5/10):
Ever since the end of the first season, less focus has been put on the main trio in favour of an ensemble cast. Of all the cast, one character that gets a huge amount of focus is Historia Reiss. If any of you don’t know who that is, then it’s because for the entire first season and most of the second, she went by the identity of Krista Lenz, a kind-hearted girl who would do anything for anyone and had many admirers, with more than one person mistaking her for a god. Since revealing her true identity and getting abandoned by her best friend, Ymir, however, that cheerful, charismatic girl is gone in favour of a broken, borderline-emotionless person with serious self-esteem issues, with many of her selfless acts early in the series being revealed to stem from an obsessive need to prove herself a good person to others. As a result of this revelation, Historia ends up going through an identity crisis until she ends up discovering the true reason she was born over the course of the Uprising arc, and soon learns to grow into her own person instead of a mere façade. The focus and development she gets over the course of the arc is such that she is more important to it than any other character besides Levi, with each of them having a connection to one of that arc’s two main villains. She does slip out of focus in the second half of the season, but this is perfectly justified in-universe, and the development she gets manages to make her favourite character in the series outside the main trio and Levi.
The third season continues the second season’s trend of fleshing out the villains into more than just mindless monsters. As I mentioned above, the Uprising arc features two main villains, one of which is technically subordinate to the other, but both of which manage to have equal prominence in the story. The best of these two antagonists is Kenny, a high-ranking member of the Military Police whose mere presence is enough to make Levi wet his pants (you read that right) and is proof that a psychopath who’s willing to kill just for a few kicks can still be a deeply complex and sympathetic human being. His badassery, surprisingly sentimental side and fascinating relationship with Levi has left a long-lasting impression on me, far more so than the arc’s other antagonist who, while still excellent, was a little too ambiguous for my liking.
Besides those I’ve mentioned, there are plenty of other new characters introduced over the course of the series, but it’s hard to talk about any of them without giving away huge spoilers, so it’s better that you simply watch and discover them for yourself. In addition to the new cast, there is still all the characters from the first two seasons we’ve grown to love, and even with the increased focus on other characters, the series makes sure that every character plays their part, save for those who die too soon to contribute anything, of which there are a good few due to the nature of the series. While it is highly unlikely that you will like every character, odds are that if you don’t like somebody, then that’s pretty much the entire point. 
Enjoyment (9/10):
As epic and gripping as it is, “Attack on Titan” has never been easy on the feels, and this season is no exception. In fact, if anything, it’s even heavier on the feels than previous seasons, in no small part thanks to the increasingly complex morality, with the Survey Corps engaging in multiple morally dubious acts in order to achieve their goals. This is acknowledged within the series itself, with more than one character questioning both their own morality and that of those they are working with, even if they’re still definitely good people in comparison to those they’re fighting. There’s also a lot of blood and death, more so than previous seasons, so if you’re a particularly sensitive person it’s best to either not watch the series or, if you do, keep a couple of tissues handy.
Overall:
We may have had to wait over half a decade for “Attack on Titan” to get to this point, but any sane fan is likely to agree that it was well worth the wait. Whether it’s the story, the visuals, the music, the characters or the action, season 3 either almost matches, matches or surpasses the first two in just about every aspect, and more than lives up to the build-up of its predecessors, making it highly unlikely that fans will not be pleased. And with the anime currently in the middle of its final season, only time will tell if it manages to maintain this quality all the way to the end.
Score:
10+10+10+9.5+9=48.5/50=9.7/10
Mean Score: 9.7/10",10
"
                SPOILER ALERT: This season is a perfect 10 for me and truly my favourite season of AOT so far. As there is a focus on human on human, its a refreshing break from the human vs titan theme the other seasons focused on. There was a significant amount of politics in this season but its truly enjoyable because as always, Isayama has the talent of capturing true human emotion thats usually not touched upon in alot of animes including greed and fear. You get to see alot of backstory on characters such as Levi and Erwin which help to further give more dimension to their
                  personalities and become even more likeable. Also lots of character development for Eren and Historia. Eren's impeccable iron will is broken down in this season revealing his despair and lack of confidence of being humanity's greatest weapon, while Historia, who is seen as impressionable and desperate for validation becomes completely badass in this season, taking ultimate leadership in the last few episodes. Amazing season and I am in awe of Isayama ability to bring us further us into his titan filled apocalyptic world.",10
"
                ""Everyone has to be drunk on somethin' to keep pushing on... Everyone was a slave to something.""
*rewatch*
S3P1 feels like a thrown together mesh of characters, politics, and lorebuilding, to cram as much buildup as possible for P2; and damn, it works.
A medium size cour that is split up into 3 main consecutive parts - the government revolt, Historia's arc conclusion, and the preparations for the recapturing of Shiganshina. The constant perspective switch can feel jarring and under developed, but consistency lies beneath. World building is a constantly evolving matter - from the deep dive into societal structure and government control inside (and underneath) the walls
                  to the mystery of the Titans slowly unraveling, there's never a dull moment in the development of the intricate fantasy setting.
From the beginning one of AoT's goals has been to shine the light on the evils that grow within the sacred walls that are said to keep the same corruption out. S3P1 takes it a step further with the introduction of Kenny and the Reiss family line. Everyone is truly ""drunk"" on something, even Erwin and his internal desires to follow his father's path for information. But episodes like ""Bystander"" expresses how such drunkenness can bring out the pure beauty that comes from the simplicity of life. This ""foul is fair and fair is foul"" theme is one of the highlights of AoT's excellently developed moral dilemmas, and I loved seeing it used in a more broad context as opposed to just the main scouts in S2. It's easy to get caught up in the surrealness of human transforming titans and mind controlling bloodlines when the life of the average humans living inside the walls shapes the plot so much.
Historia is the most conflicting side of the season still though. There's something holding me back from truly enjoying her as much as I wish I could - and maybe this is where the adaptation that many people complain about falls flat (I personally have not read the manga at the moment)  - and it's pretty disappointing. There's something about her character arc that feels disconnected, and I think I'm starting to piece together the reasons why.
Take Levi for example - one of the best characters in this season. Through Kenny, we finally learn about his beginnings living in the slums and the violent journey he took to the top. Not only did it give reason behind his melancholy attitude and make him more interesting as a whole, but it also creates a connection back to what I was discussing earlier - the importance of the average human being in this world. Levi is a product of a so called ""safe"" society everyone is led to believe, but it couldn't be more far from the truth. Almost every strong character in Aot - Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Erwin, etc - are all somewhat a product of the evils that brew from humanity, and all things that can happen to the average Eldian. As a result, Levi and the rest serve a larger purpose than what's immediately presented.
Perhaps I'm overlooking things or it stems from simply  not being able to completely connect with her character, but with how drawn out her character arc is over the course of a season and a half, I don't see this same well thought out ""purpose"" I see in everyone else. Don't get me wrong; I found the soul-searching journey to learn what it means to truly do what YOU want to do pretty empowering at times, especially at it's climactic finale, and I really like the similarities you can create between Frieda Reiss and Ymir. I also do see how her stepping up for the position of the Queen but taking the time to help out the under privileged through the simple things like harvests is the show's way of creating the connection between Historia and the running theme of being ""special"" the season focuses on. But by the time the conclusion did finally hit, it was far past the point I was ready for the back and forth from her to be done with and as a result felt more like a shell of other, more successful characters. In order to create such a purpose, there needs to be a strong foundation through the character's own arc; even if the pieces for greatness are there, without the glue to keep it together, it misses the mark.
To cap it off, AoT really has the curse of production, doesn't it? It's a step forward and a step backwards from the last season. The animation, character models, and overall look is a big step up from last season, but still far from the greatness of Season 1. At the same time, the great direction from the last season that created such nerve-wracking tension in certain moments and developed the horror elements so well feels pretty much gone. It's not like there's necessarily much in its place either - the style itself looks fine but feels like a hollow shell of its past self. Even the bold outlining on character models feels pretty much gone. It's not a necessarily bad thing, and Season 2 wasn't too much better, but it's a step that was probably taken due to budget restrictions more than anything.
Overall, I really loved returning back to S3P1 and have come to appreciate it a decent bit more. It's a bit messy at times and Historia's character arc has plenty of flaws but the slower pace and stronger focus on political drama has great payoff and leads into true greatness.",8
"
                The third season of Shingeki no Kyojin succeeds season two by upping the stakes and the action even further. While I still think I prefer the first season, I think that Season 3 is a close second.
The plot in Season 3 takes a bit of a twisty ride, with lots of big reveals and information being dispensed to the viewer. I think I liked most of the reveals, and I do feel that quite a few of them added more intrigue to the story, although I do think some could have used a bit more setup.
The cast of characters remains the same, with a few
                  additional side characters. While I don't think these characters were anything too amazing, one of them is crucial to Levi's backstory, which I did find more interesting. Otherwise the characters are more or less the same.
The art and sound of Shingeki no Kyoujin continues to impress, with its bright explosions, epic battles, and good music to top everything off. The animation was good, except for a bit of slightly dodgy CGI. The great quality really pays off in the dramatic battle scenes, with people flying through the air, and massive titans battling it out.
Overall I enjoyed Shingeki no Kyoujin Season 3 quite a bit and excitedly anticipate when I will dive into cour 2.",8
"
                Story
Once again, the main problem is the pacing. It is not as bad as season 2, but stuff takes too long to happen. The back and forth flashbacks can also be jarring as well. The lore is definitely more developed this time around than in season 2. Some episodes will definitely want to wanting to know more, but that is more of the case in the latter episodes. The lore is developed even further
Art
Great animation and artwork especially the battles
Sound
The opening song is very jarring and does not fit the series or the season.Character
There is more chracter developemnt and backstory this time around than in the previous season, so that is a plus

"
                I feel like this season/arc, along with its opening, is underrated and underappreciated. As for me, I think it's the best in the series. Really, the opening sets a lot of the tone and really matches what's going on story-wise. And this season's tone and sense of mystery is very compelling, and I love how Erwin's question about who the real enemy is in season 1 is finally being addressed in a coherent way. It's kind of ironic how the main draw of the show (titans) are largely absent here and it's probably why this season is my favorite. In addition to the story and
                  characters being the most compelling they've been, this season has arguably one of the best (if not the best) action scenes with Levi. And the spoilers within the credits amazingly foreshadow some hard times ahead. Overall, very enjoyable.",9
"
                This season might be the most forgotten season out of all of them, and I did as well, but it is a very vital part to the show, and I feel like the plot was some of the best in AOT so far.   
Story 10/10: The world is shown to be more horrible than we thought it was, with nearly everyone having some kind of bad side apart from the survey corps, with even more questions to yet be answered.  The philosophy really started to shine in, and that seemed to be one of the driving forces of this season.  That
                  could also be the downfall of this season, as it was so complex that if you haven't gotten spoiled you seriously don't know what is going on for most of the season.  
Art 9.4/10:  I missed a lot of the titan to titan action, but in terms of pure art and ODM action, this was by far the best Attack On Titan has ever been, and probably ever will be.   
Sound 8/10: Very underrated opening, not as good soundtracks as previous season as it was not an action filled season meaning they weren't able to use all the best songs. 
Characters 9/10: This is another place where this season really shines.  We explore Levi's backstory and how it relates with Kenny.  Both of their arcs are really amazing and it has a great payoff, especially with Kenny and his philosophy in life.  Eren as well finally comes to understanding of the whole situation after his breakdown and by the end of this season he has let go of some of his rage and actually starts thinking more and becomes more logical and how rash he was in the past.  
Enjoyment 7/10:  First time I watched it, it was so confusing I just did not get what was happening for many times.  Second time watching it, it was infinitely better, but that still does not totally eliminate how I really didn't enjoy this season as much first time watching through. 
Overall (about) 8/10:  A bit better than the first season, but I feel how it sometimes gets too confusing and how it can get boring makes it not the best of AOT. This is the perfect set up to Season 3 part 2, though.",8
"
                The same amount of excitement and quality has carried on to the rest of this anime, I can only be so bold to assume the final season will be amazing as well, despite not reading the manga to see what the ending will be. I loved the fight scenes in this season, it hyped me up to the utmost of their ability, which just proves that they really haven't gone down in quality. Also, the way the story unravels proves to me that it's not your basic exterminate-the-enemy-type-anime, yet it's focused on the storyline, expanding the world, letting you know nearly every character. Amazing, as
                  expected, never fails to impress, 10/10.
Reviewing this anime is, in general, pretty tough, because the seasons are pretty linked, and, how could I say this without sounding like an idiot, it carries on in a way I would not expect it to, in a good way. The way they've made this anime made me feel like I was watching a longer season, not 4 (technically).",10
"
                I haven't been a big fan of Attack on Titan, and this season really doesn't do much to remedy the situation. Keep that in mind with my review, since it makes me more likely to be critical of things I dislike. But I think this season was pretty evenly balanced with both good and bad things, so I wouldn't quite say it wasted my time. I will continue watching out of curiosity to see where the story develops.
This part gives us some much-needed exposition, and I'm glad to see some of the ideas I had after Season 2 starting to pan out like I hoped.
                  A secret ruling family with the titan power required to rebuild the walls was exactly what I thought would appear, so the developments here were overall satisfying. I'm looking forward to finding out what exactly is in the cellar, but I'm finding it hard to buy into the hype the series has been trying to build up.
But I've got pretty mixed feelings about the characters. I thought it made a lot of sense that Armin of all people was the first of the crew to shoot a person. It makes sense that the others would hesitate, but Armin has always been one of the few characters capable of looking at his situation with a balanced view. The incredible single-mindedness of most of the other characters continues to be a problem.
However, Eren in particular was just insufferable this time. I've never thought very highly of him, but it seems like he's just not even paying attention to the story. There were a few scenes where it just seemed like everyone except him understood what was going on, including me as the viewer. Then, another character has to go out of their way to explain something that was already self-evident. This is one of my least favorite things an anime can do. It's a step below having another character explain a scene to the audience because Eren of all people should really be more aware of his own situation.
The art was generally fine, but the Mr. Reiss just looked strange. His design came right out of the uncanny valley. Maybe it was intentional given his connection to the titans, but it really didn't seem that way. Titan power in general needs a much better explanation ASAP, because we need a reason as to how Mr. Reiss got so massive and generated so much heat.
The fights with the gunmen were neat. Levi continues to be my favorite character. Hange surviving the fight makes it seem like the show is really turning around tone-wise, but not enough that I can start getting invested in any of the characters. The fight with the Reiss titan felt pretty average. It seemed like it was supposed to signal a moment of growth for Krista, but her bond with her dad felt pretty tenuous from the start so it had no impact.
Eren's powers continue to change for no discernable reason. If the upcoming cellar episodes don't put in a lot of work explaining how Titans work, I'm going to be disappointed. My guess is that Eren's stubborn lack of confidence causes a similar lack of consistency with his powers.
Attack on Titan is difficult for me to recommend. While I can see the appeal, it doesn't stick for me at all. The only thing that saves it is the neat action it sometimes has and the mystery surrounding the titans. While I'm satisfied with how the mystery is developing so far, I am losing confidence in the rest of the story.",5
"
                   This part is peak Attack On Titan such an insane step up from seasons 1 and 2. The main characters finally got depth and development after all this time, Erren becomes a lot less annoying and more mature, and selfless, Levi gets much-needed background and his relationship with Kenny is beautiful. The side characters also stepped up, Historia goes from a helpless, naive, member of scouts to a badass mature warrior. The action sequences were so well done and fluent, the animation is gorgeous during the scenes. Once again another banger soundtrack that gets me hype every time.  The story this time around is really unique and complex, it took a really unexpected direction that makes the world and series itself a lot more interesting. The pacing was overall a lot better as well.",10
"
                This is in my opinion the best season of this show as the first one had more action than soul, the second had more soul than action but the third season has finally hit the golden balance. But the real reason I love this one more than any other season is because it has on of the most brilliant poster that I have ever seen in the entire world wide entertainment industry.  What else do I have to say about it, we got more intense talks, more epic hype train moments and more of the survey corps in general. Watch it if you're stll
                  that one person who hasn't seen it.",10
"
                The series is starting to get better, but they keep making major mistakes. I really want to like Attack on Titan, yet it keeps disappointing me.
Bad:
After watching season two and three episodes of season three, I realized that I am not too fond of the short piss-stained hair chick. Her voice is unpleasant; she is a Mary Sue, some other characters see her as a goddess, and she only gets attention because she is what the series is fundamentally about (which is not a good thing).
Why do they balance the weight of the series on two characters? Main character does not mean most important character.
It
                  took 44 episodes for the short piss-stained hair chick to turn into a real character. I understand why she was a mindless doll, but not really. Having gained what she gained made no difference in her mentality. The writer(s) changed the character to keep the plot moving. Therefore, the short piss-stained hair chick is most definitely the worst Attack On Titan character written so far.
The pacing is still poor. I had to skip through a few episodes filled with unnecessary scenes and stories.
The CGI was bearable before, but now it looks horrendous — especially on a certain individual.
Mikasa is the real threat to humanity. Everything she does is for Eren. If Eren wants to sacrifice himself for the good of humanity, Mikasa would disagree with his decision. Not because she thinks it is a bad idea for humanity, yet because Eren’s life is in danger. At this point, Mikasa is not her own character — she only lives for Eren. She is like a pimple or parasite.
Spoiler: In a coup d’etat, why would you replace a defective leader with the child of that defective leader? Put the candidate, who is most fit to lead, in charge, goddammit! Why do they have to have a continuing line of royal blood? If Erwin, Levi, Armin, et cetera stayed true to their characters, they would turn the kingdom into a democracy instead of continuing a stupid monarchy.
There are crazy oxygen machines and auto-titan killers, and no one can develop a working prosthetic arm? Sigh.
Good:
I am so happy that they fixed Mikasa’s art design. I roasted the hell out of her in my season two review. The main problem was her horrible lipstick/lip color and the inconsistency of her eyes, head, hair, face, and body.
People are underestimating Zoe and Erwin’s intelligence. They deserve to be treated as smarter characters than Levi and Armine — at least on the same level as Armine. Levi has a high battle IQ. Armine has a general high IQ. On the other hand, Zoe and Erwin have an exceedingly high general and battle IQ.
In the beginning, there are a few action sequences with Levi in them. I could die complacent knowing that something as beautiful as that action animation exists.
I am extremely thrilled that food girl got a lot less screen time. Also, her scene with the meat was pretty funny.
This is how I see the characters at this point (from Best to Worst):

Levi>
Reiner>
Annie>
Zoe>
Eren>
Armin>

"
                My perception of of Season 3 part 1 has changed since rewatching it. The first two seasons were already finished airing when I started watching the show, so this was the first one where I was watching week to week rather than binging it all at once. The result was that I thought this season felt slower paced and a bit boring compared to the first two. In actual fact the story is just as tightly written and well executed as anything that came before.
Admittedly there is a shift away from large battle set pieces toward more political drama, but they even find a way
                  to make that exciting. The military's coup was a supremely satisfying end to the bureaucrats that were ruining life inside the walls, and sets the tone for how the series would progress and continue to tear down corrupt powers in order to secure more freedom.
If all the bird imagery and the rhetoric of Eren Yegar wasn't blunt enough for you, the central theme of this series is freedom. People complain that this season strays too far away from Titans and just has humans killing humans, like later seasons of Walking Dead where it forgets it's a zombie show. But even while the Titans fade into the background they're still essentially fighting against the same forces. An oppressive government can make the common man feel just as helpless as a Titan can make you feel.
So, I think that I'm going to up my grade for this season to match what the rest of the series as a whole deserves: 10/10. It's a masterpiece all in all and even if it seems like some parts are slower or not as dramatic, when taken in the context of the greater story it's all just so good.",10
"
                This season is a real improvement over the last one. I feel it’s a little bit arbitrary to review just part of a season (or even seasons as part of a show for that matter), but what can you do. 
About the first third of the episodes had a fast pace but the later two thirds were slower. I like to take my time, and to have time, to digest everything that’s happening instead of being bombarded with new and possibly incoherent information. So it’s fine on the whole, but I would have liked it if the earlier episodes were a bit slower. 
Following is
                  a rapid fire of small things that annoyed me when watching the show, without spoiling anything with too much detail. Almost the first thing that happens in the first episode is that Levi manages to deduce exactly when, where and how something is going to happen just before it does happen. This obviously looks kinda cool but it’s unrealistic and dumb. Tricking the audience by showing something that didn’t happen should be forbidden. Also discovering that a person is a fraud is obviously a big deal for the characters, but for the audience that has barely seen that person it isn’t much of a reveal. 
Why did Eren’s memories return when two people placed their hands on his back? This time the deus ex machina is obvious when Eren actually finds a bottle containing superpowers. Does this show even care anymore? But I guess it’s not one because he secretly trained to achieve those powers. Ah, that’s fine then. Not. Mikasa is still cool when she’s not obsessing over Eren, too bad that’s all she does. How can anyone call her a real character? She possibly develops in the coming seasons, let’s hope so. 
But this season isn’t just filled with small annoyances. It explains a lot of things that were still left unexplained from the previous two seasons. And the explanations aren’t totally unreasonable. This gives me hope that it will continue to evolve into something more cohesive and interesting. This was the season which finally made me interested in the world by actually giving some backstory to it instead of just hinting at one.",7
"
                to my opinion the season 3 part 1 of snk os the best (for the moment) because in the first seasons the heroes fighting titan but in this season they fight humains which brings out their monster side and which allows to develop many characters like Armin they show us that they are ready for anything to achieve their goalsand it is also the season that makes us discover Erwin the most so far we only see him as a monster ready to sacrifice everything while in this season 3 we are shown why he has such an obsession to discover the truth shows us
                  that even if he lost an arm he is still just as legitimate as the leader of the exploration battalion that his greatest strength is his impartiality, his analytical strength in all situations and his intelligence . Historia too is many developp in this season at first she is naive and suicidal but in this season she has a real character she no longer wants to be dependent on anyone just to live her life fully as she is and to be able to die without regret we discover too the incredible past of Levi with Kenny and we have a fight just légendary levi vs kenny the student has exceed the master and the past of Kenny with Rhod Reiss the obsession of Kenny we have the begining of the verity 
now about the animation nothing to say just wit studio 
the sound the ost are the best and for me the opening is one of the best of all snkhe is as this season diferent but people don't like what is different and they are wrong 
Overall this season is perfect",10
"
                Season 3 of attack on titan for me was a little less enjoyable. Personally for me I really liked the action and wish Eren always would do more. I still really like all the characters and each one has a purpose in the show. Season 3 mainly focuses on developing the storyline and making it more complex. It is a lot slower and features more human against human battles which was actually fun to see. I thought Kenny was a great character as well and overall everything was fine. I understand why this part exists my only compaint is that it slows down a lot.
              ",8
"
                I know you already hate me for this rating, but I’ll have you know that I’ve rated all other attack on titan seasons either a 9/10 or 10/10. No, I’m not just one of those people who hates on popular anime just to be different. So hear me out. 
(spoiler free)
 
Story - 6
The story starts out slow, with just about no titan action. There are some backstories revealed here, like Levi’s past. Couldn’t be more boring. Levi’s “father” wasn’t great to him. Boohoo. That doesn’t excuse how cocky and mad Levi is 24/7. However, the story picks up in the second half and we get
                  more action, just not titans, instead it’s between humans. Luckily more of Eren is shown, and there are some suspenseful moments. A lot is added to the history of titans. But at this point, I wish the characters could be closer to the cellar. Even Sasha says “wait, the cellar is actually going to be important now? I almost forgot about that” once there is talk about the cellar near the end of the season. I honestly can’t tell if this was a joke put in by the writers... because this is literally what I was thinking as a watcher, except it’s not a good thing to have important plot points forgotten about do to the slow pacing of an anime. Also, why the heck has nobody talked about Reiner and Bertholdt? You’d think that these people would be going through an existential crisis, digging for any answer they could possibly find, and talking about how shocked they were of that extreme betrayal. But no. Seems like our characters have somehow already moved on and don’t worry about how two of their trusted comrades literally were the reason that got them into this whole mess. There is some titan action at the end, which was scary just like the first season! Defiantly the best part of the whole season. 
 Art - 10
Art is great as per usual. 
 Sound - 8
I get why some people are mad about the opening, and don’t get me wrong, I love the fiery and exciting openings we got in season 1 and 2. But those just wouldn’t fit for this season, since there is a lot less action. The opening is nice and peaceful with some cute visuals of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin as children. However, it doesn’t come close to beating an opening like Sasageyo.
 
Characters - 4
I didn’t see any character development throughout this season except for Historia. That being said, I didn’t really care for Historia. Her character isn’t that interesting - she’s the quiet, nice girl, and who would have guessed that she is going to have a turning point where she decides she’s not gonna be that quiet nice girl anymore? Come on, everyone has seen that kind of character before. Another problem is Levi. His tough guy attitude is really cringe worthy this season. There is a scene where Levi and Erwin are arguing about something, and Levi threatens to break both of Erwins legs if he doesn’t change his mind. Erwin remains completely calm and basically says “No...” and what does Levi do? Eventually accept that he isn’t going to change Erwin’s mind, which he could have done way earlier. I mean seriously, who talks to their higher up like that? Shouldn’t Erwin be threatening to break both of Levi’s legs if he doesn’t cut the bossy and unnecessarily rude act? It’s almost as if Levi is trying really hard to be like Kenny. Even though Levi claims to hate Kenny, he is a lesser version of him. Kenny is a tough guy naturally, which actually makes him a kind of like-able, cool character. But Levi tries way too hard to be tough like him and it just makes him look stupid. Another problem is Mikasa. I swear 99% of what she does in this part is just coddling Eren. “Eren, eat your food! Eren, get to sleep! Eren, you need to rest!” It’s like her only personality trait now is just being obsessed with making sure Eren is in perfect condition. 
 Enjoyment - 4
It’s frustrating how slow this season went, but I still enjoyed parts of it, mainly the end. Honestly, one of the best moments was in the last episode. While it felt at first like a total dud finale with nothing really happening, Sasha gave us some drama! She goes crazy for some food yet again and Connie and Jean struggle to rip her off of it. This is unfortunately one of the few times in this season where I was on the edge of my seat: “how will they get Sasha away from the food? Will tying her up work? What if she eats all of it and the other people hate her?”. I’m not even kidding, most of the season is so slow that it doesn’t even beat the levels of suspense in what’s supposed to be a funny scene of Sasha going crazy over food. 
Overall - 5
I’m disappointed. Don’t skip this season, because it does have a lot of important information on titans. Just don’t expect to be on the edge of your seat like you were for season one. I can tell you that it’s defiantly worth it to power through this season, because part two of season three is so much better, and back to the usual titan action like in season one! 
 TLDR: I couldn’t really help but be bored while watching a good portion of this season due to a lack of character development and slow pacing. It’s by no means terrible though, and has some redeeming moments you will really enjoy.",5

                - some spoilers ahead -
FANTASTIC ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I LOVED IT
this season was so so so so good, i enjoyed so much!! just everything about it seemed to be a step up from the previous season and it met every expectation i had, and more
so in terms of the plot, this season was more focused on historia and the reiss family, and in turn that led to more information about eren, his father and the true nature of titans, all of which was part of the quest to discover how to retake wall maria and return to eren's basement. i really appreciate how the plot is
                  starting to tie together more, in my opinion it flowed really well - even though there are things still left to be answered which i can't wait to see, like who the beast titan is, what is in eren's basement. and although this is a show about titans, this (half of a) season contained very little of them but still managed to be incredibly dramatic with its political intrigue and squad missions that were like a cat-and-mouse game, a theme which i LOVE
also the action was PHENOMENAL. totally mindblowing in its detail and insane pace and artistry. really brilliant to watch, i could not get enough. levi vs kenny's squad is seriously one of the best scenes i have ever seen ever, just brilliant. they really stepped it up in this season and i really loved it.
it's a shame eren spent a lot of this season kidnapped or then feeling rather maudlin (as usual) (even though it is a change from other protagonists i've seen so it's certainly interesting), and mikasa spent all her attention on eren (as usual), but the other characters showed a lot of personality and growth! levi i love you so much my number one guy you're the best <3 i love characters that have a cold exterior but are actually really soft hearted and concerned for everyone else inside so of course he's my favourite. plus the fact that we got to understand more about his youth through the introduction of kenny, who could have been a really interesting character had he been featured more in the show. also hange and sasha and jean i love you guys too
really really great stuff

                this is so hard.... THIS IS JUST TOO HARD..... again, this season was great like the previous one. ima just start babbling the whole series here by the categories.
story: no pls. it was just outstanding. the plot goes smooth and well-put. no comment.
art: like every wit animation. amazing
sound: ok i need to say something here. im basically rewatching rn. for my fellows who already saw season 4 as well, you will agree this opening was a pain to see and hear... okay back to the main thing, the sound was not bad at all.
character: this season's character development was next level. we found out about
                  historia's past, eren's parents, levi's past as well and more. much information that was totally needed to understand the characters more.
enjoyment: its always a 10:)

                Shingeki no Kyojin season 3 and all the seasons before it have been about the survey corps and how humanity is constantly fighting the titans in order to attain peace. Issue is that after season 2 things have started getting a little boring, there is not as much comedy and the whole theme is just more boring, almost completely about killing titans and protecting walls, sure it looks spectacular and season 3 blew all the previous seasons out the water with this quality and animation but that is not quite enough to keep me glued to the anime. 
I would give the story an 8,
                  the overall feel of this anime has not changed but I think season 3 just made what season 2 started downgrading even worse, it isn't like this anime isn't interesting or anything but it had blueballed us too many times and it needed more content that has refreshing my head as its sole purpose, instead of that it has more boring and bland moments.
The art is not exactly a 10 but easily a 9.5 (9), it just looks outstanding, the views and everything are just very good, great art but it is not exactly a 10.
The opening is ""Red Swan"", fine song, has some english lines and it is overall fine, easily one of the worst. 7.5/10, it sounds like some part of ""creep"" by radiohead and space oddity or something. The ending is ""Akatsuki no Chinkonka"", okay this is a nice song. Sounds good, 9/10, the sound is an 8.
The characters are still interesting, we got stuff happening like the godamn basement, Eren and his giant transformation stuff, Erwin's goal and all that. It is interesting and they're a fine group of characters but not too good this season, a bit drier. 8/10
Overall Season 3 was alright, not bad, not good but it sure is worse than the previous seasons. Not fun, not miserable, quite average but because I liked the theme and overall anime I would give it an 8.",8
"
                I love Part One of Season Three’s uniqueness. This is when the show began to transform into people becoming a threat and I enjoyed every second of it. The introduction of Kenny and the detail that was put into the royal family really stand out to me. A lot of this season laid down the blueprints for what AOT becomes. The end of Historia’s arc was very fun to watch and quite satisfying. As well as a dive into the back story of Levi, this season was a fun twist on the usual. It’s definitely up in the 9-10/10 range, mostly depending on how the
                  viewers reacts to the shift in enemies.",10
"
                This is kind of a build up season to the part 2 following it. But it still has such a fascinating arc in of itself. You find out a lot more about the universe, and the Royal Family. The revelations are drastic and change the show a lot. Getting to learn more about Levi's backstory was cool, he's a fan favourite and even I appreciate learning more about the short fella.
The titan hardening present is cool, I like the icy look of it. The animation looks particularly beautiful here due to it's settings being a bit different from the past two seasons. The royal family
                  members have good depth. A flashback shows on of the ones who's already gone. He is a very likable person surprisingly. I like that kind of non-black and white character building, where supposed enemies to people aren't necessarily enemies to them.
The animation, sound, music etc. hold up well. Although the opening song is weirdly emotional and sentimental. Kinda strange but it's a little funny. It's a leg up from the previous two seasons. It's a great first parter for a great third season. And for that it gets an 8/10.",8
"
                Season 3 (part one) of Attack on Titan has one, count it, one issue. It cuts a sizeable of manga content, content of which makes the characters and the story more perfect then without (they also removed a scene of Levi shirtless, which should be considered a hate crime.) Season 3 isn't as action-packed as the first two seasons, but the amount of plot, worldbuilding, and character is genuinely hard to fathom. It makes you sit on the edge of your seat, always wondering what will happen next. The animation is absolutely bonkers (a scene in the second episode had a whole year of animating
                  and polishing. If that doesn't speak for the animation quality, I don't know what does.) Once again, my only gripe is the amount of content cut between the manga and anime. It doesn't make it impossible to watch for manga readers, but it is still sad nonetheless.",9
