                After an endless wasteland of filler, Naruto returns! Joy! Happiness! Frowns turned upside down! I couldn't believe it when the fillers ended. I was ecstatic. 
Now I'm ready with a pillow whenever I tune in every friday. Question mark? I'll tell you why I'm prone to falling asleep while watching Naruto:Shippuuden - it just isn't Naruto anymore. It just isn't the same series.
Story: Don't get me wrong, Naruto didn't just magically start stabbing me with disappointment because the story started to totally go downhill. In fact, the first episode's preview with Naruto's future encounter with Sasuke had me on the edge of my seat. I
                  couldn't believe it: Naruto was back! No, the story continues and follows through adequately as a continuation of the original Naruto. The great elements of the original story are still here: the theme of an everlasting friendship, the importance of maintaining hope, the need to endure and persevere .. these themes are all still there! Naruto is still a great guy and he still strives to protect his friends and 'save' Sasuke while taking on Akatsuki at the same time. So what happened to Naruto? Well, story-wise, nothing. I still love the story. I love the world of Naruto, the ninjas, the techniques, the weapons, the themes, the plot. Although the story doesn't present the viewers with anything deep or complicated, I still like it. But the story isn't the problem. The story as it is and as it continues, gets a 7.5/10 from me.
Characters: It was great to see how much the characters changed from the original Naruto. Character development in this aspect, was great. Pretty much everbody had a new design and they all looked great. In terms of personality, well, they were the same loveable characters, unique in their own way. In terms of Naruto and Sakura, they really developed. Although he still acts like it, Naruto isn't the same happy loudmouth he used to be. He's been deeply scarred from Sasuke's betrayal, and despite all thats happened, he's still obsessed with saving him. Of course, Sasuke's betrayal affected Sakura too and she's really toughened up. She isn't the useless twist she used to be, and shes really grown to respect and care for Naruto. Character development is great, the characters are great, old and new. Sai for example, is an interesting add on, he brought the funnies and kept the comedic aspects of the show alive. The characters aren't the problem either: 8/10
Art / Animation: Here is where Shippuuden starts going downhill. In terms of the new characters and their new character designs, I love em. But Naruto just isn't animated as well as it used to be. There is a lot of repeated animation in Shippuuden. This ranges from terribly animated tree jumping scenes (it actually looks more like they're flying instead of jumping half the time, lazy much?) to staring faces and overused flashbacks. I can understand the need to repeat the frames from things like the tree jumping scenes that are filled with dialog, or the occasional flashback to remind us of what happened in the original Naruto or something a couple of episodes ago. But the extent of it is teetering on the cliff side. The quality is just going downhill. Kakashi's new Sharingan attack for example, was terribly done in my opinion. I could have done that effect in photoshop. To make it worst, they drew it out for minutes on end ... completely destroying the 'cool factor'. There are also several still scenes that consist of pure eye to eye combat with wind blowing in the background. Cool? I think not, not when pointless staring takes up about 15% of the episode's air time. Asides from this, the coloring and detail of the characters in terms of shading and such also seem to be lacking in contrast to the original Naruto. Looking at the two, they just aren't on the same level anymore. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to the series, or because I've watched so many more series since the original Naruto, but the quality has definitely deteriorated. Of course, some of the big fights are still animated quite nicely: 7/10
Sound: Things just get worst from here. While I loved the new opening and closing songs, the episode bgm just isn't the same. The upbeat action music heard in the original Naruto has been replaced by lame 'lets make this fight seem really tense and epic' music that fails horribly. I want the old soundtracks back! Granted, the series is alot more serious now, but the background soundtracks really can't shake the excitement meter up to where it used to be: 6/10
Ok, so it's the same story, continued. The same characters, with some cool new additions are there. The animatiors are getting a bit lazy, and the soundtracks aren't making me chew my fingernails anymore. Does this really warrant a 6? 
Pacing: This is what has killed Naruto. Not Akatasuki, Not Orochimaru, not Sasuke, not Sakura's poundings - the pacing has killed our beloved hero, Naruto. This is the sole reason that the plot development seems slow and nonexistent, this is why character development is hard to note unless you really love the series, this is why animation is being reused, repeated, or not done at all, this is why I can no longer enjoy Naruto like I used to. So much time is deliberately wasted on mundane scenes such as staring, or camera panning that there are often many awkward pauses that make you wonder, 'did my computer freeze?'. This should NOT be happening in an anime! The amount of still scenes and overused camera panning should not be in surplus and evident enough to deteriorate the quality of a show! There are so many episodes that had amazing potential to be jaw-droppers, but they weren't. Intense battles like episodes 41-43 are completely ruined due to horribly SLOW SLOW pacing!
Arguably, the animators want to avoid killing its viewers with a plauge of fillers, but is it really worth it to completely destroy such a potentially satisfying anime? In my opinion, they're ruining the series. We waited and endured just as our hero taught us to - only to be attacked by this monstrosity. The pacing effectively destroyed my love for this show. You may argue that fillers are worse and thats debatable. What isn't however, is that there is enough manga material for at least another 50 FAST paced Naruto episodes. Thats a year! Probably more when you consider that by the time 50 episodes are released, there could be enough material for another 20 or so potential episodes. 
Overall: Same enjoyable story with great potential. But the pacing needs to change. That pillow I mentioned at the beginning of this long, terrible review? It wasn't for sleeping. It was to stop me from killing myself from bashing my head against the desk as I watched a potentially good series slaughtered before my eyes. 6/10",6

 Naruto Shippuden : Review |
-------------------------------------
Naruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years. 
Let me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times. But please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has
                  been the best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular while also explaining its flaws.
-----------
Story - 8
-----------
The story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun while being able to take itself seriously when it needs to. It starts off where the first part of Naruto ended and the very first scenes gives us a sneak peak of things to come. The series eases you back into the world of Naruto with a slow paced , almost SOL like first few episodes. And the story then on is presented in a collection of long well constructed story arcs with the bigger picture stories of Sasuke and the Akatsuki being told parallelly till a certain point. Down the line this is series deals with more mature themes and darker tones and manage to execute well on most of those themes if not all. The story is mainly hampered (not ruined) by fillers and pacing issues which I will discuss below.
Let's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole.
The issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plot line at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don’t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself. 
However, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is,
Pacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up.
Now that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives.
The main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply. 
Another thing that this series does very well is explaining its core concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile and detailed power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out.
The amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming pretentious.
Something that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he has already started setting up major events that happened in the last of episodes of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. Same thing applies to the moments that tug at your heartstrings , they feel genuine because how the story builds up to those moments.
Being a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines.
As I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series. 
Variety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these!
The last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer as the villain had almost no personality and motives were shaky at best. Without spoiling anything all I can say is that decisions taken during the last war arc felt like it was done to unnecessarily prolong the final battle and messed it up with a poorly written villain and bad story decisions. But the final episodes after the War arc manages to reign it all in and give a proper farewell to the series it so richly deserves.
Throughout the series you will witness friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, characters growing up, politics, romance, and the world itself change. It can be flawed at times but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning.
--------------------
Characters - 10
--------------------
Now this is the core of the franchise. 
Each character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out.
No matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths. 
You will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships.
Now let's move on to the ""Villains"" 
This series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes.
*Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex* [checked] , *Money Hungry Villains* [checked] , *Religious Psychopaths* [checked] , *Villain who is after Revenge* [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the ""heroes."" The morality here is blurred.
But coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it.
-----------------------------
Art and Animation - 7.5
-----------------------------
Again we have a mixed bag here. 
This show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par.
I think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita’s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11! 
Despite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation.
And as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this.
--------------
Sound - 10
--------------
This is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like.
------------------------------------------------
Enjoyment and Overall Experience - 10
------------------------------------------------
Naruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment. It's by no means a flawless anime , but it's an anime with highs that more than makes up for it's lows. It reaches for the stars but makes a few tumbles along the way , but the best moments of Naruto are some of the best moments in the medium itself.
And with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation.
Sub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended
-----------------------------------------------
| Recommendations for Similar Series |
-----------------------------------------------
[Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series.
[Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well. 
[Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here. Whether the highs of Hunter X Hunter matches up to the highs of Shippuden or FMA Brotherhood is up for debate, but you won't have to sit through any lows like you have to endure with Naruto or Naruto Shippuden.

"
                I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuuden is one of my absolute all time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why with this review of mine. 
First of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuuden is the darker tone, the maturity and the depth in Shippuuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage,
                  being clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke. 
I loved Naruto's dorkiness but in Shippuuden he becomes serious. The series as well. Now the friendship and loyalty takes over. The mysteries get their answers and new questions take form. 
Akatsuki, the moon plan, Madara, war... the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, the cliffhangers... these things are what makes Shippuuden one of the best animes I know. Kishimoto has built this massive foundation for us to walk on during the first half, and now he slowly digs into the core of the story. It keeps you on the tip of your toes. That's why the story itself gets a 10/10 from me. Story (10/10)
Of course the art is much better than Naruto. Shippuuden has much more attention for details, the characters' outfits are much better made, the colouring and effects are so much better animated. The landscapes are beautifully drawn. Fighting scenes and emotional scenes are something I've noticed myself are paid much more attention to. The characters movements flows better.The realistic feeling is all over Shippuuden. Great! Art (9/10) 
To be honest, I prefer not to notice the sound at all. Sound in movies and series shouldn't be noticed. The music is there to strenghten the mood. And since I don't notice the sound and it makes me feel what I'm supposed to feel, I guess the sound is well picked. I really liked the piano pieces in Naruo. Grief and Sorrow is an extraordinary piece. But I especially enjoyed the Pain soundtrack with the choirs and dark pipe organs in Shippuuden. Sound (8/10) 
In Naruto and Shippuuden, Kishimoto is very focused in telling all characters stories. All characters have their backgounds and special personality. They all feel like real people that you know and they all grow throughout the series. You follow their Changes and that's what is so great and important about a series that is this long. The character development.  (10/10)
So, to justify and defend Shippuuden... 
First of all, you have to understand the use of fillers. With an anime this long the writer can't keep up with the pace. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of the manga. When the anime has reached too far, they have to buy time for the writer to write more. Or, they could make it like many other animes... Make up another story and end for it or just pause it for a couple of years while Kishi draws the manga like crazy. But that wouldn't make anyone happy. Please, stop going on and on about the fillers. They are there for a very good reason. 
Naruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wishes to become the Hokage, to a serious, hardworking, loyal friend who doesn't only want to save his friend, but also the whole ninja world from the neverending cycle of hate and despair. I enjoy the series extremely much and I hope that you do too. ^^",10
"
                First off I just wanna say that I am super sad that this show has come to an end.  Naruto was my childhood and with it's ending I feel like a part of me is now gone.  This is the show that got me into anime and I'm grateful for that.  This show is no where near perfect, but is anything really perfect ? 
I'll start out with some of the cons of this show. As many other reviews have already stated, Naruto is loaded with filler episodes and this can't be any more true.  At times the fillers can be
                  funny and interesting, but most of the time you are just impatiently waiting for the show to get back to the real story line.  There were tons of flashbacks and honestly they show the same scenes from the past multiple times.  The story can be rushed, and at other times it feels like it's been the same battle for like 5 episodes. The artwork in the battle scenes can vary from good to not so great.  But even with it's many faults, I still gave this show a 10/10. ( honestly if you hate fillers that much, just skip around)
I don't know where to start with all the great things that this anime has to offer.  I'll start off with the characters.  The character development was great for the main characters and even some of the sides characters.  I think that the show did an excellent job in giving each character a unique personality and they really made sure that you knew all the characters and their backgrounds.  The development of the characters was so great that I was constantly questioning who my favorite character really was.  At the beginning I honestly thought that Naruto was annoying and ignorant, but the growth and development of Naruto really grew on me and he began to become one of my favorites. Okay next is the story line.  The plot was pretty interesting, but very long.  While it did seem like the story was at a standstill for a while in the show, the writers did a good job at subtly setting everything up.  Little things that happened in random episodes sometimes came up later as being important.  The plot was like a puzzle at times, where I would try to put the pieces together.  I actually really enjoyed how they set it up like that.  Like Naruto and his friends grew, the story grew as well.  In this sense I mean the vibe and mood of the show.  It starts off more as a fun action comedy, but as the story goes on, it gets more dark, emotional, and the maturity level of the anime just increases.  I'm not kidding when I say that this show can actually teach you life lessons.
 I highly recommend watching this whole anime.  Even though it is loaded with fillers, by the time you get to the last few episodes, you'll start to feel emotional and sad that it's come to an end.  While this isn't Your Lie in April or Clannad, this show still will definitely hit the feels.  The end will have you feeling nostalgic, sad, happy, you'll honestly be feeling so many different emotions.  This anime may be 500 episodes, but it is totally worth it and in the end you won't regret it.",10
"
                Let me just clarify this now while we’re both still at the very first sentence of this review, and also, at the very first sentence of my very first review ever, but; Naruto Shippuden, and the entire Naruto series in and of itself, is my most favourite anime of all time. Yes, you may think differently, or even otherwise, but I’ll just simply state this now, it is my most favourite anime ever. If you’d care to know why, or you’re simply curious, read on. 
Story: 10/10
I personally think that the story of Naruto/Shippuden is great; it may not be the best, and it may
                  not be perfect, but then again, when is anything ever like that? Shippuden follows the life of the protagonist, Uzumaki Naruto, as he attempts to retrieve his former teammate, Uchiha Sasuke, who has left the village and everyone around him, in the pursuit of gaining power to get revenge on his older brother, Uchiha Itachi, for the massacre of their entire clan, including their own family. 
In the beginning, back in the simple days of Naruto, it was all about the story of a boy whose dream was, and still is, to become hokage; the greatest ninja in the entire village. This young boy wanted to prove just that; that he was great. He wanted the village to respect him, to prove that he wasn’t just some ‘demon-fox child’, who was feared of, due to the terrifying nine-tailed fox that was sealed within him. And now, it’s without a doubt, safe to say, that this story has evolved from so much more than that.
Everything in the original Naruto series has ultimately lead up to Shippuden, as we, the audience, learn more and more about the characters and the story as a whole. We begin to delve deeper into the core, as more enemies emerge, and more stories and secrets are revealed. Questions that have went on unanswered are finally beginning to obtain an answer, as more questions take their place, and everything slowly, but surely, begins to get tied together. Shippuden, apart from its former series, takes on a much more serious, deep and mature tone, causing us, the audience, to really empathize and act, to either cry in joy or sadness, and I for one can honestly confess, that yes, here and there, this anime has made me cry, multiple times. This anime teaches you; a lot. Shippuden teaches you about the true value and significant importance of family, friends, and life itself. Sure, perhaps, a few other animes have been able to do so, and maybe even to a higher and greater extent, but nothing compares to Naruto. The long amount of episodes only causes the audience to grow with the characters and the story itself.
Art & Animation: 8/10
Simple. I’ve seen better. But, Shippuden has really stepped up from its former, in regards to visual aspects and animation, it’s improved greatly. There is much more detail in Shippuden than in it’s former, and the colours are either much more vibrant or the complete opposite, in order to properly convey the scene better. Fight scenes are played out more smoothly, with an adequate use of blood and cuts and scratches and such. Close-ups on the characters’ faces are also quite good, the emotion on their faces seem true, real.
Also, I agree with plenty others, that flashbacks are completely overused. I find myself saying, quite often, ‘We saw that scene literally an episode ago!’, and honestly, it’s not helping the story so much. I understand the need to replay flashbacks, even of episodes we’ve already seen, and most of the time, I can handle it, but it’s overused, and fails to portray the expected suspense of the current scene. Other than that, art & animation; quite well done. 
Sound: 8/10
The openings. The endings. The OSTs. Most of which are particularly good! The improvement in the sound is evident, and the animation played out during the openings and endings are well put together, matching the song rather well. Emotion is thoroughly conveyed through the amazing voice actors in this anime, who, excluding the dub actors, perform screams and cries and laughs next to flawlessly. Great!
Character: 10/10
Character; also translated to the sum of ones’ personality and being as a whole. The characters in Shippuden are great, excellent even! Each and every one of them have a completely unique personality that differentiates one from the other, and seeing them all come together, as friends or as foes, it’s easy to admit that the character development is superb! There are so many characters, each lovable and excellent in their own unique way, with beautifully well-put together pasts that create the particular character we see now.  We see how the ‘heroes’ have come about, and how each of them have managed to cope and move on with their lives, to become something else entirely, something better than they ever used to be.  The ‘villains’, too, have a particular past event, or particular emotions that somewhat humanizes them and redeems them to a strange extent, and we realize that they’re not only ‘evil’ simply because they are. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do, and who they are as a whole and that’s what makes each character amazing in their own way. Sure, some may be bland or dull, weak or annoying, strong or insane, but if each character didn’t even have a single flaw, what would that make them? Human? Surely not. The characters in Shippuden are beautiful and lovable, which in turn, causes us as the audience to feel for them and empathize, and that’s, honestly, great.
Overall: 10/10
Shippuden is clearly one of the greatest animes of all time, and perhaps that’s an overstatement, or maybe even an understatement, depending on your own thoughts. But, if given enough thought, Shippuden wouldn’t have become so popular if it wasn’t great or amazing, even to a short extent. Some of you may have seen animes better, or worse, or even of equal value, but towards the end, Naruto/Shippuden is clearly one of its own. I, and anyone else probably, couldn’t agree better that the fillers in this anime are truly horrid and awfully annoying, but, you know what, overlook it. Don’t watch them. Simple. An animes’ worth isn’t valued by its amount of fillers or overused flashbacks or anything, its value comes down to how much a person, themselves, think it’s amazing. So if you haven’t seen Naruto/Shippuden or you dropped it for whatever the reason may be, I encourage you to watch it and give it a shot. 300+ episodes, along with the original 100+ episodes in Naruto, is crazy, sure, but they all add up to one hell of a story and I say, sit, watch, and enjoy the ride.",10

                  Oh, I hope that I’ll be the first to write the review when all the Naruto anime series end. Well, what should I start with… 15 years. For FIFTEEN years this anime brought me joy and unspeakable emotions. For FIFTEEN years it taught me right from wrong. For FIFTEEN years it … it’s been a guide of light for me. Jeez, I was raised on this anime, I became older with its characters, I just LOVE IT!!! 
  The Naruto series started when I was in a preschool age, and for 15 years it never stopped to surprise me. Though
                  the journey was long (some might say too long) it was always exciting and brilliant. And I am really sorry if I get carried away by emotions, but true Naruto fans will understand – this is a tale, a unique and flawless tale, of nearly all of my life and now that I look back and see that little Naruto who used to be always alone, without parents, without friends, and I turn my look to who he became through these years – the Hero, who saved the world, Best Friend that was always there to help and to understand, and now – a husband… ah, I might cry. Seriously. Perfect ending. Naruto and Hinata deserve their piece of happiness. And though we did not see this in original manga series, I was really glad to be able to see that kind of and end in anime adaptation.
  Now let’s get back to the show and analyze everything peace by peace. 
  I’ll start with the story. Indeed the plot, the fantastic world, all the jutsu techniques, all the creatures and characters, everything that we saw in Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden world is a creation of a mastermind – Kishimoto Masashi, and for that I bow to him to the ground. Just imagine how impossible it was to create such a wide universe with all of its own structure (villages, clans, fractions), its own history (all the clans and villages wars), its own beasts, beings and heroes etc; and how unimaginable was it to make this huge machine work. There is everything I love about the story and about how it is served to the viewer revealing its genius from all sides. It is groundbreaking in every way possible.
  Now let us head to art style. Generally it is satisfying. Well, it is hard to make every episode look like Kimi no Na Wa (you can consider this a recommendation), especially when you have more than 700 episodes (Naruto + Shippuuden). But I can praise creators for really good special effects and the way they’ve made all ninjutsu types look like. And though I must admit that Naruto movies absolutely compensate lack of original shows’ drawing it does not make the original run look worse.
  Unlike art styling – music really is the VERY strong side of the series. From top to bottom it is impeccable. Every opening, every ending, every song from the series is something breathtaking and mind blowing. I truly enjoy every track and I can sincerely call the Narutos’ OST one of the best of all time in anime industry. The openings like Hero’s Come Back (OP 1), Sign (OP 6), Toumei Datta Sekai (OP 7), Diver (OP 8), Shilhouette (OP 16) will fire you up and make your spirit riot; the endings like Shooting Star (ED 1), U can do it (ED 15), Dame Dame ga (ED 31), Spinning World (ED 32), Zetsu Zetsu (ED 40) will make you believe that you just witnessed a dream that you never want to end. I am not even mentioning stunning Hisou, Kikyou, Sengunbanba, Utsusemi tracks that appear at very exact lyrical moments and touch your soul in its deepest corners. The chorus tracks like Akatsuki and Pains’ theme songs make you feel goosebumps and your hair stand as you stare through the eyes of our heroes at fearless overwhelming enemy hordes. An incredible work by the composer – Yasuharu Takanashi.
  The characters. Oh, there is so much to say. This is something galaxy lvl. Nearly 100 characters, each with their own temper, beliefs and credo, each of them is trying to make an impact at the world they live in. I will always remember characters like Madara, Itachi, Nagato, because their own vision of the world and the steel will they’ve shown to everyone is something worth of admiration and respect. All the heroes are versatile, unique and incomparable to each other. I am not mentioning the number of skills and techniques each character possesses and how multiform and complex they are. Worth mentioning are beasts like Tailed once. They are that destructive force everyone is trying to lay their hands on, but the author shows that they are something more than that – they have souls and feelings, and no one can see their good hearts under the scary masks. 
  The enjoyment that I personally got from this show is something outstanding. I enjoyed it to the core and absolutely adore it. Maybe that’s because I felt much the same as the main hero and ‘ve been a witness of many injustice things in this life, and the anime shows it very good. The human’s greed, the way we only think about our own sake, even the way kids treat someone who is not similar to them – it is a part of the masterpiece that Naruto is.
  Colossal work by Date Hayato and everyone who worked to make this show to be this titanic and go on nonstop for 15 years.  I personally bow to all of you and say: “Thank you for the best childhood memories, I will always carry them!” And again I want to congratulate Naruto and Hinata with wedding, and thus my beautiful dream is over, meaning that I grew up and it is time for me to let my childhood go.",8

                Shippuuden was a step-up from the original series in some ways, but it's worse at other points, making it just so-so.
The story has become increasingly complex compared to the original series. You still have the whole deal with Naruto wanting to become Hokage, but that is very overshadowed by many new plots. You have Akatsuki who's after all the Jinchuuriki, there's Sasuke and his quest for revenge, Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Team 7's quest to get back Sasuke and Danzo's plot to take over Konoha. Yeah, there's a lot going on, and I enjoy that a lot - a plot-rich story is always fun
                  to watch
But - and this is a big but - there's severe pacing problems. And by severe I mean excessively dragged out nonsense which could've been done in half the time... at least. The first arc took 30 episodes. It could've been finished in much less time, but they absolutely have to drag it out with endless nonsense fights. The Sasuke and Sai arc was fairly okay, though, but still a little slow on the pacing.
&quot;But if they quicken the pace it, we'll get more fillers. Oh noes!&quot; Yeah, some people think that. However, I'd rather have them quicken the pace and have more filler than getting my viewing experience ruined by a sluggish pace. Fillers can be good, you know.
The animation in Shippuuden is better. The new character deigns are great, and I find that the coloring is less dull than it was in the original series. It's becoming more flawless too, but it still struggles with small flaws here and there. However, it's still Naruto, and its animation has always been simple in my eyes. There are no big details to brag about, but sometimes simple works; it's mainly a matter of getting used to (and most people watching Shippuuden should've already watched the original series, which means that you've most likely gotten used to it).
The soundtrack so far in Shippuuden is fairly decent. I still haven't heard any remarkable themes, but none of them has been outright bad either, so I'm fine with it, but I wish they threw in some good themes. They do, however, fit right into the current events, which is a small plus. There's not much to say about the OPs an EDs so far; they've been very average. 
As of episode 58, there have been low amounts of character development, and for 58 episodes that&rsquo;s not really good. The reunion of the new Team 7 and Sasuke is pretty much the only traces of any character development so far, aside maybe Sai's interactions with the rest of the group, which is always funny to watch, and it's interesting to see if he'll ever learn how to properly interact with the others. The introduction of him and his actions is pretty much all that keeps my character rating on 7, because we've hardly seen any of the other characters, and the small amounts we've seen of them is nothing special, really; it's like most of them have just faded away. I'm still hoping that some good character development and all that will come though, seeing how Naruto will probably have to struggle with the Kyuubi inside of him, and not to mention getting Sasuke back; I'm hoping that it will provide us with some neat character development.
So far, I'm very &quot;meh&quot; about Shippuuden, but if it rids itself of the pacing problems I'm going to enjoy this much more than I'm currently doing now.
EDIT: Well, it has improved as of late (Dec '08), so I am upping the character and enjoyment ratings to 8

                Naruto Shippuuden! The series that would never end finally ends! After ten years, five-hundred episodes and several movie tie-ins, this milked cow is finally laid down to rest, resulting in one of the worst shounen anime adaptations ever made. While I did enjoy myself with the series and certainly found myself even liking it for the first two-hundred episodes or so, the insane amount of filler, padding, and the abysmal final three or four arcs made me despise this show by the end, and all of the characters and narrative. The filler in this anime is such a goddamn problem that it destroys the entire
                  anime, and at this point, if you did want to get into Naruto, I would recommend reading the manga, or skipping over the filler because, for the most part, the filler is absolutely abysmal and is rarely interesting or adds onto the overall world of the series. Since this review is going to spend a long time detailing all of my problems with the story, I will address the animation and music now. While I still prefer the original soundtrack of Naruto, Shippuuden is still great. The action pumps you up and there is a great variety in songs and moods to fit each moment and scene. The animation is a different story, however. The anime is very inconsistent, and that is to be expected with a show with over five-hundred episode; at its best, it could be movie quality, it’s worst, trashy nineties OVA.
Shippuuden is the direct continuation of the original series, set two years after the events that transpired in the original in which Naruto has trained to hone his skills and jutsu. Upon returning to the village, he fights off against the Akatsuki, a group of powerful, rogue ninja who wants to collect all of the tailed beasts to create the ten tails and rule the world, while trying to save his gay lover, I mean best friend, Sasuke. Now, I want to clarify first of all that I enjoyed the first season very much (excluding the fillers, that is). It was fun, the battles were original and creative, and the characters went through great development; it captured the hard life of a ninja perfectly and the cruel world in which they live in. Shippuuden was also pretty good for a little while in the beginning of the series, albeit not as interesting or engaging as the previous story arcs of the show.
One good thing about the sequel is that Shippuuden is a lot darker and more mature than the original series, now with the Akatsuki clan running amok and killing many of the tailed beasts. There is this constant sense of looming danger and tension in the series and the Akatsuki were easily the best thing about part two. All of them are interesting, had unique abilities, and for the most part, are allowed to shine in their own respective battles. Hell, there are even a few character deaths which took me by surprise, which added onto the steaks and tension of the show. The first one hundred episodes of content (minus the fillers) are pretty great although I did have some problems, most notably being Naruto and Sasuke themselves.
Naruto in part two is annoying, whiny and irritating, and his constant journey to save Sasuke feels boring and without much sense logically, since Saskue becomes a complete dick head, hell bent on destroying the entire village. Sasuke starts off wanting to kill his brother, and after the worst plot twist in the series where we learn his evil brother was, in fact, a good guy, which I’ve always hated, all he wants after that is to destroy the village and everyone in it, and his character fluctuates so much throughout part two that it becomes hard to keep track of. Both of their respective story arcs hit brick walls by the end of the Pain arc and hardly develop at all past that, just in their power levels. Speaking of the Pain arc, the conclusion to that very same story arc was so bad that I lost all hope in the series. After a great fight in which much of the main cast die, Naruto has a friendship speech with the villain in which after, he brings back all of the people in the village who died! This removed all of the tension from the series and was such a cheap way to bring back characters that I began to hate the series from that point onwards. Combine that with characters who did receive some screen time in part one, now being pushed to the sideline with no development, aside from Shikamaru, but even after his own arc, he is pushed to the side to make way for the yellow-haired twit. In addition, Naruto’s character is ruined after we learn he is the child of destiny and was destined to save the world since he was born. This meant all of his hard work was for nothing and is such a giant middle finger from the author, that after this point, I hated the series. From this point on, we know that Naruto can never die nor lose since he is destined to save the world. His fate is pre-determined from the start, which does remove some tension from the later arcs.
It also destroys Naruto's main theme at the same time. Naruto's driving force was that hard work and endurance would pay off in the end, and earn you  respect from the people around you, even when the whole world is putting you down. In the early parts of the series there was a genuine sense of satisfaction in watching Naruto grow as a person and the catharsis pay off that entailed was great after all his hard work. Learning that he is a destined child, and was destined with all these great powers from the beginning ruins all of the hard work and endurance he had to go through to gain respect as a shinobi. Essentially, the author shot himself in the foot and omitted one of the driving forces of his story. 
Now, let me elaborate a little more on the Itachi plot twist before I go ahead and why I didn't like this twist in the story. To me, Itachi was a great villain, someone who killed his entire village just to test his limits, leaving his younger brother alive to act out revenge on the part of his fallen clan. Like Saskue, we hated Itachi at the beginning, which we should of, since this makes a great villain. Itachi is strong, ruthless, and cunning. All of this, in my eyes, anyway, made him great as a villain, but Kishimoto, works in a twist that reveals he was a good guy all along and killed his clan to prevent a war from occurring. Essentially he had to carry a huge burden on his back from the village elders, which is admirable, but it also causes Saskue's character to go out of control from this point, and fluctuate so frequently. I always found this twist to be kind of ""meh"", for a lack of a better term. I never hated it per say, to the point where it broke the series or anything, it's just that I think Itachi was much better as a villain than a good guy. But hey, this mini-rant is just down to my own personal preference. 
The worst character out of them all is Sakura. Now, I don't think she is useless in this series. Hell, she has a pretty okay fight against one of the Akatsuki members and wins, which is something I can appreciate, it's just that her character goes nowhere. She stays so stagnant and boring, whilst crying about Saskue. And holy hell does her love for Sasuke feel forced as hell. It makes no sense why she loves him to this extent, especially after the bastard almost killed her and threatened to destroy the entire village, killing everyone she loved and had known. Back in the original I could kind of excuse her crush on account that she was a young child, but now it's laughably pathetic and doesn't even make any sense. This applies for most of the female cast in the series since Kishimotot can't write good female characters. They're either completely useless or completely superficial. That's it.
And this brings us to ninja war arc and everything that came after. These final arcs were awful. All of the clever tactics and strategies the characters had are now gone, in favour of who could pull off the most landscape reducing jutsu, and Naruto and Sasuke become so powerful, to the point they rival gods, even going as far as having them both die and then re-birth as an act of destiny. What I always hated was that all of the characters that died before; characters that I liked and had well-completed arcs were brought back to life since the author was too lazy to create new ones. This ruined many of the original arcs these characters went through, and I found this, for the most part, to be completely boring since they just repeat what happened previously. Sure, there is some development and growth with the characters, but it's hardly substantial enough to raise the bar. All of the previous rules and ideas that Kishimoto establishes in the early part of the series are thrown out and it's painfully obvious that he didn't even care about his own series in the end since the justsus and abilities some of the characters can perform goes against the rules of the world that he established. A good example is when Kakashi gets two Sharingan which would require a large amount of chakra to use. We've been told time and time again that this character, while having a wide range of impressive jutsu, doesn't have much in the way of chakra and thus can't battle for too long but in the final arcs he performs so many Jutsu it is unbelievable and when he does require the double Sharingan it makes no sense how he can utilise its power, especially since he obtains it at the end of the war and thus his chakra would have been completely gone! Another example of crap writing is after Naruto is reborn, he somehow saves Gai from dying just by simply touching his chest! It makes no sense why he can suddenly do this and this element is never explained to us at all. Not only that, but a few moments later he restores Kakashi's eye in the same fashion, but fails to restore Gai's dead legs, for whatever reason. What an asshole!
These final arcs are so full of ass-pulls, random power-ups and last for so long that I can’t stand the idea of watching them again. The final fight between Naruto and Sasuke was pretty impressive and I’m glad it wasn't stuffed with filler but it’s not enough to save the whole series. The “final” villain Madara was the only thing I liked about the final arc but even then, he was replaced by the true final villain who was terrible, since the author had no idea how to end the series nor of how to get rid of such a powerful enemy.  Kaguya was such a terrible final villain, only being relevant for about ten episodes or so. The biggest problem is that she came out of nowhere. There was no build-up like Madara. Madara felt justified to be the final villain because of the build-up and the pay off with him was pretty good, but Kaguya was boring, dull and had no narrative steaks or intrigue behind her character at all. She was truly the worst final villain I've ever seen.
I could go on and on about every little thing, but I’ve covered everything that pisses me off the most so I’ll leave it at that. I do enjoy Naruto, despite the obvious flaws, but if you want to get into the series, just read the manga.",3
"
                First off, I would like to let you know that this is my first ever review and I'm glad it's going to be for Naruto.
Naruto was an anime which would leave first time viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, it was like this immature anime with not much of a story to it and it's main character was just this silly, clumsy immature kid who is determined to become the Hokage of his village some day. It made viewers go through a painful number of fillers to get to a serious part which made many fans disappointed at the end of the first
                  series.
Naruto Shippuden. This was basically like a present for those true fans who sticked through the endless fillers to finally get serious about the show. It shows how deep and how matured the show was meant to be.
Story: 10 (Outstanding)
I know this may sound biased, and many would feel 10 is too much for a show like this but bear with me. The MC, Naruto Uzumaki who seemed like this not so tough, silly, immature kid and all he thought about was being the Hokage but the story actually revolves around him in so many other ways. It finally isn't just all him anymore, the different characters who took part in the first series become more important. The suspense of revealing the truth behind more truth is intense, it makes you want to keep going on. There was even a touch of love in the series and it was felt throughout the series. It's a story which will make you get into each of the characters but expecially Naruto as it doesn't miss out a single day of his life.
Art: 9 (Great)
I didn't want to give art 9 as well as I've recently sceen better art in several other animes but what made me stick to 9 was the fight scenes, the minute details of a single move, the background reacting to every other things and also the characters started to look more like how modern animes had their characters drawn with a clearn touch, and so my score.
I think sound enters this catagory and so, let me explain. Naruto Shippuden has wonderful soundtracks which fits in perfectly for each situations in the anime. You would get that feeling of getting deep into the series with the help of the soundtracks as well. And so I give art, with both great sound and great animation a 9.
Character: 10 (Outstanding)
I've mentioned before about Naruto just wanting to be Hokage someday but the character development of this single person was too good, his reasons become more clear as he grows. This anime is named Naruto as it follows him through everyday with every other main characters in different episodes. You get to see him grow up to be a very mature young man with huge responsibilities. But why this anime stands out is that, it doesn't completely miss out on the rest of the characters. Each characters have their out arc and it's explained well and the whole story with it's well times flashbacks makes it as though, the detailed bits and pieces are filling out a huge puzzle, the puzzled world of the Shinoby.
Enjoyment: 9 (Great)
I had to think twice here about whether to give 9 or 10 and be honest to myself. Though I love this anime so much, I actually skipped all of the fillers, just seeing the start and the end. But that's the only downside for this to miss out a 10. The reason why I did that because I couldn't wait any longer to get back into the series, the story as it was how much I enjoyed watching it.
It has his humorous moments which would make you laugh for quite sometime but there can be annoying parts where Naruto just stays silly like always but you still end up laughing at it. But as much as it has it's funny parts, it has it's intense parts, love, loyalty, despair and even hate.
Overall: 10 (Outstanding)
Overall, this is one anime which stands out for itself, though it has it's endless fillers to catch up with the manga, it's something you shouldn't miss out. It's one of those very matured, well developed, well characterized anime which keeps you on your feet while you grow up with the series. 
On a side note, the majority of the people who hesitate to try this show from what I've seen was because of the huge number of not so fun fillers. I would recommend skipping out on fillers as they hardly include stories related to the main story.",10
"
                TL;DR: Believe it! Took 10 years and 500 episodes but it finally ended. Guess that cow finally ran out of milk! 
[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 6/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 7/10]
Believe it! The series who was never meant to end has finally been laid to rest… or has it? It may have taken 10 years and 500 episodes (280 Cannon and 220 Fillers, believe it, I counted), thank you Studio Pierrot for finally stop milking this cow. Let's be real, all the real fans got so tired of your shenanigans they finished the manga long time ago. So why would you invest in this
                  super long show?  
Rage aside, what's Naruto: Shippuden really about? It's a story about an unwanted ninja shinobi boy who had the dream of becoming Hokage and believe it he will overcome all the adversaries (including fillers) to achieve it! (But if we are being honest, it's really about Naruto's journey of finding his angry dark lover, Sasuke, to bring back home and he will ignore all his other friends to achieve it)! Jokes or Fillers aside, the main plot has two major arcs, the Akatsiki tailed beast arc and the Fourth Great Shinobi World War arc. This is your traditional archetypical heroic journey style shounen anime filled with every trope known to mankind. So if you believe it, they will employ it! The overarching theme is Friendship & Love conquers hatred & evil. How boring yet sweet & addictive. 
If you are wondering how can such a boring storyline keep the audience captivated for 500 episodes? The unique characters can be a possibility. This show has exactly 212 unique characters (villagers and background people excluded) and believe it do they stand out in one way or another! The major protagonists are Naruto and his Nakamas (which is friends for those weebs who don't know) Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi. On the other hand, the list of antagonists just goes on and each successive one is more ridiculous with godlike powers & jutsus than the previous. Seriously, how Naruto overcomes them and befriends them will leave viewers breathless. Shoutout to Ittachi, for being one hell of a memorable antagonist the anime industry will never forget and should not forget, believe it! 
If the story and characters don't do this show justice, (it desn't) it's definitely the animation and sound accompanying it. Narutoverse completely changed the landscape of fighting style with its unique farcical jutsus that were hand-drawn and animated adequately well. It's impressive that most of the characters were very distinct from one another given this show having 212 unique characters. Fillers aside, the Cannon episodes were actually drawn well and the standard was reasonably maintained throughout, believe it! Moreover, given that this show is 500 episodes, it actually features around 60 unique OP/ED songs. It's a definitely a first for a show that took a decade to finish. The OP/ED songs are well received among fans and non fans of this anime. Furthermore, the background OST is composed beautifully well and it accompanies the fight sequence rather too well. This show really knows how to create HYPE and hit you in the feels so hard it will make even Chuck Norris shed a tear. 
Overall, I don't really see myself rewatching this show but I would recommend people to atleast give this show a shot. Why? Because I'm evil, no, because why not? If you are serious about it and only want to watch cannon episodes then definitely give it a shot. It's an interesting bingable show (over few weeks) and if you get tired, then just finish the manga. This show is nowhere near perfect and it has too many flaws that is just not worth ranting about it. If you ask fans of this show, they will say 10/10 but realistically looking at cannon episodes it's 7/10. Therefore, maybe you should really watch Naruto: Shippuden. Believe it!
P.S. Below is the outline for all the cannon episode.

                Why people are rating this series so low, I don't know
It's truly the end. Naruto was always something that I considered bad due to the  fillers, however once I got into it I was hooked.
Story:
Ah, the story. It's just filled with so much emotion and it was amazingly executed up until the Pain Arc, yes it went down, and we all know the War was dragged on for far too long but surely that doesn't ruin the moral of the story? Naruto always had one goal, and we always knew that he would meet stronger opponents, some that could challenge his goal, and Obito
                  and Madara were those two. The later of the War Arc is amazingly written in my opinion, the Obito regret, Madara's reasoning and much more. Overall, the story remained the same and always had one goal, and didn't go off that path. Naruto wanted to become strong, he wanted to be acknowledged and lastly he wanted to the Hokage. All which he achieved.
Art:
Sadly, Naruto's Art hasn't impressed me much, however animation in canon episodes were spectacular, especially in the final battle. Not much can be said.
Sound:
Naruto's OST is the best I have heard in any anime. Sadness and Sorrow, My Name, Gehika, and many more. They hype you up, just like any OST is supposed to be doing in a Shounen. Naruto's OP''s were great too, I can listen to them all day anytime.
Character:
Naruto has lots of great characters. Although the bad thing is that in the war the spotlight is mainly on Naruto and Sasuke. This doesn't take anything from the other characters though. Characters such as Obito, Nagato, Itachi and Madara are so amazingly written. Never in an anime have I cheered for a villain. Nagato and Naruto's conversation really hits and it also makes you think about  today's society. People kill and kill but they know this leads to more hatred and revenge, something that will eventually bring the world down, just like it did in Naruto. Naruto and the rest of Konoha are great characters, all are special and are all someone you can get invested into, of course there's the ""muh sakura is useless"", but it's still great to see all characters nevertheless. Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry is unrivaled in my opinion. I have yet to see a Shounen that has a better rivalry.
Enjoyment:
Wow, Enjoying Naruto is something very hard for some people, muh fillers, muh the anime show drags on for too long. Naruto can be enjoyed, if you take your mind off other people's. You have to go into it expecting something, if you go into it like many people you will be disappointed. We all know Naruto isn't the best shounen but still, when it gets good, it can be one of the best. I've really enjoyed Naruto as a character. 
Overall:
I enjoyed Naruto Shippuden alot. The first few arc were dragging for too long, but I still managed.  Once it got good, I really got hooked. Naruto as a whole is a story which has a really amazing world. People saying, ""wow it's another Dragon Ball Z at the end"" should know that in the first Chapter it was made loud and clear that one single demon Fox wiped out a whole Village. We all knew what Naruto's character was going to become. Naruto is something that will get alot of flack but in many years time, we'll look back and happy we experienced such a great show.",9
"
                Love gives birth to sacrifice.
It's one of the trinity of most popular animes, which includes Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. All far into the hundreds and hundreds of episodes. I finished the first Naruto series, and I'm close to catching up in Naruto: Shippuuden. So, Let's just jump right into my review, may turn out to be a long one.
Story: 6/10
I loved this story, at first. The reason it didn't get a 10/10 is the fact that it's not necessarily an original story, the concept of a ninja based anime is not at all an original concept anymore. Also, there's been reoccurring issues with the
                  plot as of lately with the manga ending and the anime still in a filler arc. But basically, the story follows along Naruto's life as a shinobi, but to take it a step further, there's added a ton of drama between characters, love interests, and how it's done throughout the series makes it such a great anime. It's an anime that I couldn't stop watching for long periods. However. The one very LARGE issue I had with Naruto as an entire franchise, and I think that all the Naruto watchers agree with, is the darn FILLER. If Naruto had little to no filler, I'd be a very happy camper.
Art: 7/10
It's pretty good, the graphics of it have improved a lot between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden. They've changed for the better and I love it even more now.
Sound: 9/10
I loved most of the intros to Naruto, but not so much in Naruto: Shippuuden. I loved the background music that was in the fight scenes or just random scenes all together. It was great to finally see an anime that understood how to choose music for specific scenes.
Character: 10/10
This anime brought out some of the best examples of characters I've seen in awhile. 
Naruto: Immature, hard headed,  strong willed, cocky, I could go on. He is a great character, he went through so much crap when he was younger, that I sympathize with him. However, I still get tired of his immaturity. His parents were killed while trying to save him, and he was sealed with the nine tails beast. The people in the village didn't take the time to understand Naruto, and they didn't see how hard it must have been for Naruto to live with that thing, or live without any friends or family. He lived by himself! It makes me mad how ignorant people were back when Naruto was a child. Naruto had to save their village from being destroyed before they really acknowledged him.
Sasuke: I know a lot of characters also misjudge Sasuke as well for being too cruel. However, he is a very strong individual who has his mind in place, and is very determined to finish whatever he has started. He feels like a very misjudged character, but he's just a very hard person to read;  you never really know if you picked up on the right notion or if  you were completely off base.
Sakura: She's a very strong willed individual. She knows what she likes and she will not stop till she gets them. She's a very determined young lady and she is very powerful.
Kakashi: He was Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura's mentor and really liked to pick fun at Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. He's a very mysterious character, but in this series we got a very lengthy but interest flashback to when Kakashi was younger and in his own team. It was very informative and very traumatic to see how sad and heartbroken his past was.
Pain: He is my favorite character out of everyone. And by Pain I mean, Nagato, and the 6 Pains. Hence the first quote on this review. It was a Pain quote said to Naruto, in the fight at the leaf village. Nagato was part of the Akatsuki. I love that group, I wish they would base a new anime on just them, and how they came about more in depth, because they explained, Nagato and Konan, and their story but they didn't really explain the rest of them, nearly as much. Anyway, Pain is just my favorite character, I can't express it in words, just his actions, his speaking, and his quotes, all just come together so perfectly.
There are so many more neat characters I could have mentioned but I feel like the review would go on forever.
Enjoyment: 7/10
My overall enjoyment of this anime was an 7. I loved the plot of the story, and the different battles, but the overall enjoyment was brought down by the whole filler aspect of the show. I realize it's a small portion of the anime, but for me I just want to stick with the main plot of the story and not drift aside. I know I can't change it, and I know that's not the only problem with the anime..
Overall: 7/10
My overall has been updated to a 7 out of 10 because of the characters in this story. They were all awesome, and well played out. The characters in this story really saved the over all rating, because if it was just based on the story and the plot I don't know if it would be that high. Now I'm not saying that the filler was the ONLY big problem in Naruto, not by a long shot. There's issues I have with some of the plot holes that seemed to have formed as of lately (seeing as though the manga finished and yet they're still showing filler that's unnecessary). I'm becoming more and more lost as the series goes on. And now it's just become a nuisance to have to keep up with it.. 
*I love criticism! Please feel free to write on my profile the pros and cons of my review, I know some of these sections were short, but that's because the characters were the only thing that I really liked about this anime. But anyway please feel free to write on my profile, I want feedback!",7
"
                   This Anime is one I have taken to heart more over then any other. Before I begin this review I want to leave a couple side notes. This review may not be entirely accurate on account of my own feelings towards the series. I will grade it the same way I did my Bleach review. If their is anyone unsatisfied with my review, then please massage me with ways of improving the presentation. With all that in mind I hope you bare with me and enjoy what I have to say.
   I'll begin with my view on the story line.
                  I had watched the original Naruto series to ensure I wasn't missing any information in shippuden. The series starts back up where it left off. Naruto had left to train with Jiraiya and become strong enough to save his friend. I figured I was going to find shippuden as bland and unsatisfying as I did the original series, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. The story is quite long, considering the show is on it's 320th episode, and similar to it's counterparts ( Bleach, DBZ and OP ) is riddled with fillers. What makes these fillers less of a nuisance is the fact that each one focuses towards Elaborating on the original story, instead of opening entirely new ones. Since the show is generally straight forward it often has many of those ""Yeah, I get it"" moments where you want to skip dialog that simply states what we already know. Small issues like this can become tiresome and seem to be the biggest issue. It seems that each episode is laid out in a manner that anyone can drop in and have some understanding as to whats happened, happening or going to happen. As for the story itself, well there's a reason this show is one of the most popular. The story isn't your basic young hero kills bad guy story like everything else these days. The young hero is confronted with an enemy that can't be defeated with a spirit bomb or a Bankai. Something beyond all other bad guys seeing as how this enemy exists in reality and is still the cause of a majority of strife in the world. He fights for the sake of his goal not just to become hokage, but to free the war ridden shinobi nations from the very claws of hatred itself. Which includes fighting with his own hatred and overcoming it for the sake of all those he holds dear and the one he seeks to save from their self inflicted fate.
   I suppose I should move on to art now. The art style is very fluent in most scenes and other then some minor issues, mostly flawless. In truth the animations only issue would be the repetition. Some fights will replay Physics animations of trees or rocks being torn or pushed or pulled, then replay it in reverse representing the other side of the explosion or whatever is causing things to go flying. Though the biggest nuisance is the over abundance of flashbacks. Again, this acts on those ""Yeah, I get it"" points and can often kill an otherwise amazing moment in the story. The tree jumping phases can get annoying as well, but are usually used to provide Dialog or representation of travel from plot to plot. The world Shippuden takes place in is beautiful in all rights, with differant climates and cultures that seem to despise each other due to their unstable history of blood shed and chaos. The fight scenes that inevitably arise from this tension gives way to some of the most unbelievably well done animations you could ask for in a fight. Sometimes, I could find the show simply breathtaking, other times people would have to revive me do to my lack of breath ^_^
   Next would be sound it seems. I'm a subbed anime kind of guy so that's what I'll be basing the rating on. The voices were excellent and suited each character like a glove. The soundtrack to the Shippuden series is amazing as well. I enjoyed it so much that I put them on my PSP and Phone. My personal favorite being Hyakkaryouran. This theme was exceptional at building up the pressure right before some of the most badass fights I've seen in all the anime I've watched. Though their are so many others that had the same effect, I found my self attached to that one song more then the rest.
   Lastly would be the characters. Naruto being the main character starts out as a slightly less obnoxious version of who he was in the original series. The few years of training have calmed him very little, and though he is significantly stronger then he was as a child, He still isn't quite as strong as he needs to be. What made Naruto stand out for me was the fact that he wasn't very strong in the beginning and was quite frankly a horrible ninja, and yet was necessary. You see, though his life was just as hard if not harder then his rival Sasuke, He chooses to move past his pain and hatred to make his future and the future of his friends worth living and dying for. To obtain the secrets to peace, though he doesn't acknowledge that as his goal in the beginning, he soon accepts his destiny with open arms and intends to shoulder all the burden so his loved ones can live happily without the pain of hatred or regret. Then theirs his Rival Sasuke, who instead of attempting to better his life, chooses to hunt down those responsible for his pain and make them pay. His power is clearly greater then Naruto's in the beginning, but his goals are clouded in the very darkness and hatred that Naruto seeks to protect him from. I personally hate him, but that's just one of the connections I have to the series. With the two main characters out of the way I can involve Sakura, who's significantly less useless then she was in the original Naruto series. Kakashi, who's just as calm and collective as ever and still one of the funniest characters in the anime. Though with so many new characters such as Killer Bee and Omoi, he might not bear that title much longer.
   Overall this anime is my favorite for many reasons. With a story and characters that I can easily connect with. Action and adventure with small traces of romance and drama thrown in. plenty of laughs and tears ( Both of Joy and Sorrow ). A story that lasts more then just one or two seasons and continues to impress. But most importantly the ability to keep me enthralled in even the most unimpressive episodes. I find that this show causes so many different anime's to go unnoticed and that makes me happy for some reason. Could be reassurance that I'm not the only one who holds the show in high esteem. Or maybe it's just my way of drawing some enjoyment out of all the haters getting riled up over their shows simply because this show's got them beat. With or without my personal opinion, I will always recommend this anime to action adventure fans... Unless they screw up the ending like they did bleach... Who know's, I might have to redo this review later.",8

                At the time of this writing, Naruto is all but over. In fact, it might as well have been over way back when the fillers started in the first season.
What started out as a great anime with a deep story and tons of charming characters has inexplicably turned its back on most of what was good about it, first and foremost the relationship between naruto, sasuke and sakura. And there are still filler arcs in Shippuuden, one of which has just begun.
We are now at episode 95 of the second season and sasuke is still basically nowhere to be seen. The first arc showed bits
                  and pieces of him, and he was on screen for 5 minutes at the end of it. Since then, he's appeared sporadically in flashbacks and extremely short vignettes as a way to tease the audience into thinking he will return soon and naruto will get back on track...but then another arc starts without him. And another. To top it all off, another worthless filler arc has just begun!
I don't mean to say that sasuke makes the entire series. Akatsuki is an interesting group of characters, and the majority of those great characters from the first season are still present and basically unchanged. However, Sasuke is a huge part of naruto, and he's gone. Gaara is one of the coolest characters ever, and he's gone. And another filler arc has just begun.
The art has also taken a huge hit with this series. I don't know if they changed production companies or what, but everyone suddenly looks disproportioned and the animation looks choppy and cheap. Sakura has a tendency to look quite mannish when viewed in profile. There is an infamous part of the new ending where Hinata's hair seems to be falling off. The art seems to get even worse during fillers...i don't know if i've mentioned this yet, but a filler arc has just begun!
Naruto is also no longer funny.
Well, I could sit here and write all day about how much naruto has jumped the shark, but there is one thing that should be said: I still watch it. I'm not sure exactly why, but I never miss an episode. If I had to pay even a cent for it, I wouldn't; but I still watch.
Although I might stop watching until this filler arc is over. The problem with fillers is not that they are worthless (i'd rather have fillers than nothing) but that they are so often boring and cheaply done, and often stray too far from the roots of the show. There are ways to get fillers right (see Bleach: Turn Back the Pendulum), but Naruto's fillers fail. Miserably.
Another %*#@%&! filler, and still no sasuke. Can you believe it?",5
"
                I cannot believe this poor excuse of a directing team gets a near 8 overall, and MANY 9's/10's for their work. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that a ""6"" constitutes ""Fair"". Meaning, this anime is better than ""Mediocre"", better than ""Decent"".
(the mean of the subcategory values doesn't equal 6 because MAL lacks a ""flow"" category)
Naruto Shippuuden is probably the most famous anime to the general American populous. You might consider that one guy the whitest guy on the planet, yet he's probably watched some form of anime: Naruto. In fact, Naruto is so widespread that you could actually have friends that can
                  relate to you about an anime for once. It is just that popular. However, that exact popularity could lead it to being ""overrated"", and that is exactly what I believe it to be.
The story, to be honest, is amazing. I like ninjas. I like people fighting. I like people dying. However, Naruto Shippuuden took a turn for the worst. One of the biggest changes in the show (from Part 1 to Part 2) was the feeling of ""ninja battles"" vs ""demon battles"". In the first part of Naruto, the highest-caliber battle was between the three Hokages and Orochimaru. Their jutsus were so badass, nobody of a lower level could contest with them. However, that level of power is absolutely LAUGHABLE in today's Naruto world. Sasuke's Susano'o will just eat the living crap out of the Hokages. Nagato will use some overpowered six-path rinnegan jutsu that he pulls out of his ass. Oh, but of course Naruto can defeat him. And that's yet another problem with the story. Naruto is apparently able to do everything, and WE ALL KNOW the Fourth Great Ninja War is going to end with Naruto reigning victorious over the antagonists. We already know that. So, with the lack of suspense, why do people still watch this anime? The only reason I can think of is its development of drama.
Indeed, this anime capitalizes on ""Talk no Jutsu"" (as coined by Sawyer7mage), where the characters are apparently in a national speech and debate competition over the gold medal or something. Seriously. There is so much talking in this anime that the fighting gets devalued to nothing. And when there is fighting? YOU HIT A WALL OF 20 FILLER EPISODES. IN A DAMN ROW. And that is what I mean by poor directing. A somewhat great storyline with promising battle scenes is RUINED, absolutely RUINED by the existence of filler episodes. Literally 90% of them are completely off-plot and not funny at all; ""oh, they're just saving the 43rd Snow-land Daimyo/Princess/cat/dog/frog"". It is ridiculous how good the producers are at pissing off the fanbase, including myself. Nothing is more irritating than waiting excitedly for the next episode, only to realize that it is a filler. And when you hit a filler, you know you'll be there for a while. Good luck man, it'll only take half a year to get back onto the main plot (or almost half a year; most filler runs are 20 episodes long). By the time they get back onto the main story, you already forgot half the story leading up to that moment, forcing you to rewatch some of the previous episodes.
Overall, Naruto is a great story and will captivate its audiences for certain; however, Shippuuden's great shift from Naruto Part 1's original premise seriously hurts its cause. The incredible amount of ""overpowered"" ninjas along with all the ""demon"" powers and the over-glorification of Eye Techniques leads to a story where only a handful of characters can even function. Couple that with the mass of fillers, and you get an anime series that is much worse than its potential implies.",6
"
                227 episodes....A good point to make a review in my opinion.
Naruto had its ups and downs but for me the ups were better cause the fillers weren't all that bad.
Now we have Shippuuden and i am both happy yet disappointed. I'll do my best to keep things brief and simple.
This series has great potential. Naruto still has his goal for becoming Hokage and being a Jinchuuriki doesn't help at all. The akatsuki keep getting in the way trying to steal the Kyuubi. Naruto is of course much older but not that much stronger as i would personally have hoped. If you also are disappointed by
                  this DON'T drop this anime! Many things will happen to make up for it including him getting considerably stronger.
Others may have dropped it based on the dubbed versions, well I'm here to tell you that they are rubbish and you should watch the original japanese version with the english subtitles. It sounds much more realistic and believe me if you are new to it, it doesn't take long to get use to it.
Fillers are also a reason people put this show on the drop list. Yes, most are annoying BUT some are actually rather interesting. Trust me on that. If you don't wish to watch any fillers or want to know which ones are good then by all means post a comment on my profile. Don't post a comment randomly, asking which episodes to avoid and such because i will ignore it. Give me a range of episodes and i will tell you which are fillers or not. You can find the list on wiki if you like.
The story is extraordinary. The anticipation and suspense of it all is worth it. As time goes on more members of the Akatsuki are brought forward and hidden details are revealed, like their special abilities and their ""forbidden"" past. You grow to love each member in your own way. You learn who is the true ring leader behind everything and why they did all this. There will be heartbreaking moments. I know because it happened to me once. I actually shed a tear before realizing that i was emotional :P The humor is still the same as before so expect much difference. It will make you smile but not fall off your chair laughing.
Some people may find the idea of Naruto trying to do anything to get Sasuke back a bit stupid or i should say what my friend said ""gay"". I understand that but think about it. Naruto never had any friends to begin with and he was able to make some as the story went on. Sasuke was his best friend and later became the FIRST person the acknowledge him. That is what makes Naruto give his all to bring him back. It's not just a simple reason like friendship, it is much more deeper.
This is a shounen series that very few surpass. Many will disagree but everyone has their own opinion. Maybe you don't like shounen and that's fine but that is no reason to not give this anime at least a try. It's one of the legendary three. (NS, B, OP) If you liked any of the other two then i see no reason not to like this one. If you still have any questions on it please feel free to post a comment and i will reply as soon as possible.
How you found this review even remotely helpful.
Feedback greatly appreciated XD",9

                As 'good' as the normal naruto series. 
Reminicent of Inuyasha - characters keep running around and nothing really (ever!) happens plot-wise(what plot? There is no plot!) for the next 300 manga chapters  and 500 anime eps... Will Inyasha, ops I mean naruto, save kagome, ops I mean sasuke.... Seriously.... 
Most of the time is spent showing characters: running around (mostly jumping from tree to tree, it seems), standing tensely, with the wind blowing between them...Very productive and oh so tense. oh, almost forgot sakura's endless whining about poow nawuto and/or sasuke or someone/something else equally as unamusing. And naruto's whining about sasuke.
Had to watch
                  most of it on FF (3 second skip) towards the end of the eps I had.
Another useful parallel quality-wise, would be DBZ...Except DBZ probably had more variety in the lack of plot :D. But about as much action, except characters there stood around powering up for half an ep. Which is ALSO present in naruto. 
Save yourself, watch something else...",3
"
                In the original Naruto, you have a simple plot with youthful, childish humor befitting for children, as it is an anime about children and typically for children. As you near the end, the fillers can become unbearable, and everyone is excited to just get it over with and fly off into a whole new world that is Naruto: Shippuden. Naruto Shippuden is the continued story of Narutos life journey about 3 years later. Although 3 years may not seem all that long, at a crucial age as Naruto is in the anime, and the life that he has to lead, it is in fact an
                  extremely large factor in the noticeable differences between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. It seems that many Naruto fans begin watching with a mindset that still sits with the original Naruto and it's light-hearted ways, and are unprepared for the sudden strifes and seriousness of the new series. Yes, it is true. 3 years later, Narutos life is no longer fun and games.  He is thrown into a world with struggle and complexities befitting for his new age and the era that has begun in Naruto Shippuden. There is little room for the fun and simplicities as Naruto grows and begins fighting for his village and for the lives of his comrads. The series no longer focuses on childish dreams of friendship and play, it's begun a whole new era of the young Konoha's lives where pain and strife become evident in the role of growing up and they are forced to fight for survival and their ""ninja way"", be it peace or revenge, etc.
This anime is by far one of my favorites. It goes from the fun-loving story of children and continues on with more complexities and seriousness that much resembles what happens when you truly grow up in the world and must face life's tests and troubles. This anime could have either continued on with everyone growing older but their character staying young (in turn keeping the childish nature of the original anime) or it could have had them mature with age and inevitably give Shippuden a more mature, serious flow. I believe that they made the right choice by making the anime mature with the characters. It makes it feel as though I am watching the true life of the characters- Aging, maturing, struggling, laughing, crying, and becoming who they are as a person- as an adult. In the beginning, Naruto always talked about who he wanted to grow up as and what he wanted to be- and I wanted to see him do it. With Shippuden I feel like that is exactly what I am getting. Naruto's finally growing up, he's finally realizing the life struggles around him and taking charge and making a difference instead of being the ignorant child that he once was. Let's face it- their is truly little fun in a ninja world once you start growing up. I like how this anime shows the horrors of their reality finally coming into play, even if that means adding complexities to a once simple anime. 
Taking the laughter of a youthful story and turning it into the tears of a growing pain as the years continue. Watching the characters go from innocent, young villagers in (ninja) grade school, to young adults that risk life and limb everyday. This is what I've wanted from an anime. Most anime stories are just  ""this or that"". Simple or complex. Funny or sad. Cute or dark. Etc. But Naruto is different. Naruto is the life of ninjas from simple beginnings to hard endings. Happy, youthful days to waking up with the heavy burdens of adulthood. I feel like I could watch his whole life play out if it were to be written out for me, I really do.
(I am a simple anime lover and as it is a cartoon, I don't take my opinions to extremes as some other might. I don't pick at animation or subtle issues, I look at the overall picture. So, that being said, please note that this factor will show in my review.)(Also, Shippuden might have been 2 in a half years later. Idk, I'm no expert. So, I put ""about 3 years later."" I know anime fans can be very picky about your ""facts"". :d)",9

                Another Shippuden Review
by radiantfire
Context:
This review analyses Naruto: Shippuuden (simply referred to as Shippuuden from herein), an anime adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's shounen manga Naruto. At the time of writing, I have watched 39 episodes of the series.
Story:
Two and a half years after Naruto has ended, Shippuuden picks up with fresh new characters and story arcs. Although the anime generally remains true to the manga, small fillers give the story an unnecessary drag. It's somewhat amazing how, in some instances, 1 chapter can equal 2 or more episodes. However, I do find some fillers a pleasant addition to the general plot of the series.
Animation:
The animation, in
                  general, is good. Most of the time, you get decent to good animation. Other times, however, offer repetitive frames as well as poor cases of movement and facial expressions. In fact, some positions just looks so awkward. Nonetheless, I find it decent to watch.
Sound:
The BGM is decent but it is incomparable to the amazing work of Toshio Masuda (main composer of Naruto). Emotions and moods aren't expressed as clearly by the BGM. Sound effects are generally alright, so too is the voice acting. 
Character:
Shippuuden, at least, captures the essence of the characters. I like how they're generally portrayed. Evil characters are evil, good characters are good. What more can you ask for?
Enjoyment:
As a sequel, Shippuuden doesn't match up to Naruto (that is, if you don't consider all those fillers). As a separate entity, however, it's a pretty decent anime. I'm pretty sure there'll be mix comments on how people have enjoyed the series. I, for one, find it okay to watch.",7
"
                Naruto Shippuuden is the new Dragonball Z. Remember back in the day where it took like 6 episodes to finish something that should only take 5 minutes? Yeah... Naruto is turning into that. 
One of the biggest problems about the show is not necessarily the flashbacks (hey think of it as a supplement to the manga), but instead, the recaps. Recycling footage may have worked in the late 80's/90's, but this is ridiculous. You can tell that they're really just trying to prevent the show from going past the manga which, based on past experiences, is a good idea. However, fillers are better if some
                  effort is put into them (unlike the fillers from the original Naruto). 
Other than this complaint, the sequel series has been a great improvement from the original series. The animation was superb and the music fits well into the scenes. The characters are well drawn, and it's great to see the battle scenes drawn well (I still cringe at the thought of what happened to some of the battle animations back in the original). The music, well, I'll admit that some of the ops have been really annoying, but I was instantly hooked with &quot;Hero's Come Back&quot;.  Furthermore, it's great to see some better insight of some of the characters (which means, yes, I do appreciate some of the flashbacks). However, my biggest complaint about the show's character development is the fear that the script writers will revert back to the cookie cutter characters that they made in the past show, which just made things dull. I understand that a lot of the characters have a sad past, but please, cut down on the melodrama sometimes eh? The show is going to turn into a drama at the projected rate that we saw in the last filler arc. Other than that though, it's finally nice to see some villains that I don't hate with a passion though (I'm sick of seeing Orochimaru's &quot;I can't die&quot; routine). Anyways, here's my breakdown:
Story: (10/10) Hey, the core story is very great, simple and yet it involve so many different characters.
Characters: (9/10) Gotta admit, the characters are well done. It is great to finally see a better development of the old characters, and also, it's great to see the new characters be unique in their own way (how do you not like Sai's lack of common sense?).
However, I'm sick of this &quot;you have no idea how hard my life was&quot; crap from some em...
specially the last filler character, it's a bad reminder of the cookie cutter side protagonists that they made from the original Naruto in the fillers. However, other than that, 
Animation: (9/10) I think one of the strong points of this show was definitely the animation. Everything that was shown was very fluid which made the show very mesmerizing to watch. I gotta admit, one of the highlights that I found watching this show was watching everyone use their own specialty set of moves.
Music: (9/10) Ok, I liked the music, it is so great and has it always make me so emotional.
Final comments: Naruto Shippuuden is the ultimate anime out there for me. I will keep watching it week by week till the last episode (unless there are fillers involved)^_^!!",10
"
                Naruto Shippuuden
Story(9)
Well, to begin with, the main thing is still the same as in Naruto: Getting Sasuke back. But, the difference is that there are new enimies, some which you've already seen and really fight now and some you haven't which makes the story a lot more interesting. And there are some new good guys as well. Of course there are fillers(the makers of Naruto seem to do that a lot) but they are still beter than the ones in Naruto and really have a story. But....at episode 90, there starts a filler which is very boring(till 94). They could have done it in 2,
                  maybe 1 episode, but they have to put in in 4 or 5 episodes, and when you have to wait one week, and you know that the coming episode will be boring, well, it sucks. But don't skip it, because it still is cool. And it's a lot better when you can get through it in a few days.
Art(9)
The art is nearly the same as in Naruto and it is still very good. Everything is done very good and looks nice, and makes the action feel a lot more reel.
Sound(9)
There are some new sounds in Naruto Shippuuden, but they sound-alike a lot. And the sounds in Naruto were good, so these are too. 
Character(9)
As I had already said, there are some new, cool characters and of course you have the old ones. A very good thing is that they are introduced one by one, and not all at once. That keeps it a little mystery. You just want to know how they look like and what kind of new things they all can do. A very good thing about Naruto Shippuuden is, that not only Naruto is in the spotlight. other characters get a chance as well.
Enjoyment(10)
Naruto was the first anime I've ever watched, so I couldn't wait to start watching Naruto Shipuuden. And I didn't, because they had already made like 40 episodes or something. xD Just as in Naruto there will be a lot of fighting and training, what is even better than in Naruto(sometimes) and what makes it really great to watch.
Overall(9)
Well, I can only say that Naruto Shippuuden is a great anime and that the fillers are good as well, so don't be scared by that. ;P",9
"
                Yes, I'm writing a Shippuuden review. Why? I really don't know myself. Well screw that, lets get into the review.
I read most of the other reviews to get an idea of what others are saying so I don't add to the pile of redundancy, and I see that many people have &quot;tried to love Shippuuden&quot;. After watching Naruto when I was 13 and loving it, I watched other animes and realized that Naruto was far inferior to most other quality animes. Yet, because I loved Naruto so much back then (It was my first anime), the thought of an amped-up, older, maturer, badass-er Naruto tickled
                  my anime tooth (or something like that).
The first thing that excited me about Shippuuden was &quot;YES! THE FILLERS ARE OVER! Now we can have some actual plot movement!&quot; The unfortunate truth: You're not gonna be getting any of that soon...
Naruto Shippuuden feels like it could be going twice as fast, wasting half as much time, and developing characters like no tomorrow. Maybe no one has any ideas about what happens after the Sasuke issue is settled, so they're stalling. It certainly feels like that, and as the episodes drag on, I feel like im drifting farther from understanding the characters, who could be wonderfully developed.
I had set my standards high for the new Naruto, but the only thing that happened in the years that I waited was I got older, the characters got older, the plotline got moldier, the fillers got bolder, and the enjoyment got colder. It feels like even sub-main plotlines are becoming fillers, which is a shame. Naruto has such potential because of its diversity and huge fanbase, but the sad truth is that shippuuden is not much different from the old naruto.
Now that all the bad stuff is out of the way, the anime is not horrible. Its still a good anime, there's just not that special shine that you find in that anime that you usually weren't expecting. Naruto has an unbelievable amount of hype for younger kids, so if you're looking for something more mature, turn away. If you're a young viewer that just started on anime (who I doubt would be reading this, but nonetheless...) look no further than naruto. Again, its not a bad anime, its just slow, and you have to be patient. Unfortunately, that is one thing that I lack while watching anime.",7
"
                I don't know where to start, this show is outstanding. People have an annoying habit of talking down all the popular anime, and in some cases, popular anime does not deserve all the fame. But here I cant think of anything to talk down on! (Besides fillers of course.)
But anyway, Naruto Shippuden has many strong points, characters, story, music, I cant think of an any elements to this anime that have dissatisfied me. It has a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness. Its still there although the comedy starts to fade off a bit in Shippuden, but thats because so much is going on!
The characters,
                  are very easy to become attached too. The Shinobi world is full of great people, each with their own quirk or trait to better the series. The most rewarding aspect of Naruto is probably the way all of the characters, especially Naruto, grow. Coming back from the time skip from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden, you really see the characters change. Even from early Shippuden to current Shippuden, Naruto and all his friends have evolved into outstanding ninja. It really motivates me, when I see Naruto accomplish near impossible feats, when he started as such a knucklehead. My favorite thing about Naruto is that he changes all the people he meets. The author gave his character a unique way with words that makes him even more interesting! The villains, truly project the evils of the ninja world. If there's a bad character, he's bad. They have you fearing them even though they're not real. They always seem invincible, which is the scariest part.
The plot is great. There are so many things about this show that have went unanswered for so long, and the writer does such a great job of tying them all together! The plot progresses smoothly and quickly, the episodes are 23 min, but feel like 5. The twists are unforeseeable, and catch you off guard, yet at a certain degree, are slightly predictable. The foreshadowing is great. Something is said, than 100 episodes later something happens and you immediately think of the quote 100 episodes earlier. There are also so many powerful moments. I'll admit in a lot of the heart warming scenes I've cried. The best part is there's tears of joy and tears of sadness. The story really causes you to feel for the characters. The emotional/moral lessons you can get out of this are stronger than ANY anime I've seen. The fight scenes, 10/10. Each one conveys a unique message about life itself, and they are all powerful.They were all quite motivating imo. The theme of hatred runs throughout the story, and you see the clear differences of those who choose the path of hate, and those who don't. 
It also has great re-watching value, partly because you see all the foreshadowing. There are so many episodes, and a great number of them were memorable.
Soundtrack was great, I loved the openings and endings. It was a pleasure to listen to them before and after each episode. 
If there's any advice I have for this show, don't go through it too fast. The show has somewhat delayed gratification. It's hella good when you take it slow. You can't rush straight into it. I'm going to be honest, it's probably way better to people who watched Naruto as kids, because they grew up, with him. They watched him grow and mature just as they did themselves, so it's extra special. But nonetheless, Naruto Shippuden is a great ride, and anyone can love it. I'd reccomend it to anyone whose already watched the original naruto series.It really is worth the time.",10
"
                I was a little late to the Naruto party, i started watching the anime 3 years ago. I immediately fell in love with it. I was cranking out 20+ episodes in a day consistently with ease. 
As many people have surely mentioned, the fillers can be a bit much at times and they can also seem extremely repetitive and for someone who was not watching the series week by week ( or maybe even for them as well) it can be a bit frustrating and sometimes i found myself skimming though certain fillers. 
Putting aside the fillers, the story line for this series was very
                  nice, in my opinion. I very much enjoyed the fighting scenes and also enjoyed the transitions from huge fights to normal life back at the village. It was a nice blend of both. The comedic aspect was really good as well. Its tough to write without giving examples from the show, but i don't wanna spoil anything for anyone looking to watch it.
Overall this was an amazing series and it feels weird to me that its over. I had my ups and downs with it but i always came back to watch more. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a long series to watch, beware of the filler sections however. I feel this is an anime everyone should try to watch ( whether you watch it all or not). Believe it!",9
"
                ""I will bring Sauske back no matter what!""
That quote pretty much sums up a lot of Naruto Shippudean and people who read this review if you haven't watched Naruto then I suggest you watch it because there are somethings you need to know before starting Naruto Shippudean because Naruto Shipudean contains spoliers if you haven't watched Naruto. 
Naruto Shippudean is a new story that revolves around Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno's adventures and their search for Sauske Uchiha after he defected from Konoha in order to gain Orchimaru' power. There are two new characters that join in Naruto Shippudean which is Yamato and Sai. The
                  plot also involves the active Akatsuki in their quest to obtain all of the tailed beasts. 
The art style of this anime is really different compared to the first episode of Naruto.  In Naruto it was kind of a little bit cartoony a little bit but it still looked like anime. In Naruto Shippudean the art style was newer and the effects were a lot better in Naruto Shippudean.
The Characters in the story there is a lot of them but I am going to focus on the main characters. Naruto has the Nine Tails inside of him. He ultimately gets stronger because He is so obessed with getting Sauske back so Sauske is getting him stronger and making him move further. Sakura Haruno is a girl from Team 7 or apart of Naruto’s team. She has gotten stronger because she was trained by the 5th hokage Tsunade who is strong in the previous Naruto series she was obessed with Sauske and practically was in love with him but she was a weak character but now I see her getting stronger. Sauske Uchiha was a former Leaf Village Ninja who decided to wanted to gain more power so he joined Orchimaru and Orchimaru trained him a lot and how he got stronger is because of his hatred towards his brother Itachi and he wanted to kill him because of what Sauske think Itachi did. 
My overall enjoyment for Naruto Shippudean is that it’s a very good show and if you liked Naruto then I suggest you watch this show because Naruto gets a lot better and stronger. There are things that happen in the anime that will shock you or you didn’t know about different characters but Naruto Shippudean has a lot of in depth fillers about some characters past and I won’t spoil anything because that is for you to find out yourself. The show is still airing as of now and the way things are unfolding is pretty good. Overall if you liked Naruto I highly recommend Naruto Shippudean.",10
"
                A continuation from the old Naruto. While only the first 2 episodes are fillers, the remaining ones progress very slowly, probably an attempt to avoid the filler season like the first generation Naruto. Honestly, the slow plot development is worse than having fillers, because it makes each episode much less enjoyable. Conversation between characters( that do not really contribute to the plot) take up easily a third of the air time of each episode. The fighting scenes can best be described as \'same old\', apart from the intro of very limited new skills/techniques. On a more positive note, the opening theme showed great improvement over
                  the first generation.
If you haven\'t started watching the new season, don\'t- read the manga instead.",7
"
                Let me make something clear, it says ""watched 130 episodes"" at the time of writing this review, that's when I stopped watching the show. I've kept up with the manga, I know where it's going, and I stopped watching the show for a good reason.
Naruto, great show, lots of filler, but hey, I watched all 220 episodes, you did too probably. So what, who are we to complain? It ended with one of the best fights anime has ever seen, and a cliffhanger leaving us wanting more.
Shippuuden is that more. And frankly, it's kind of like going to a fancy restaraunt, having the waiter charm
                  you with the menu, bring out some great bread rolls and appetizers, and then fart on your main course. Naruto went downhill, because frankly, the author stopped caring somewhat.
Story:
Shippuuden starts out alright, they wanna get sasuke back, they see him, leaves you wondering what's going on. And the story at first is pretty good, see some good, detailed fights (which is what Naruto is mostly about) and some interesting twists, strategies etc... which is what we all fell in love with when watching Naruto in the first place.
Then came the stagnation. Looking back, it's hard to say why it's just not as good, the events themselves are fairly important and well thought out, but it's the way they're executed that leaves you with a feeling of boredom afterward. Every story arc seems to start out with some promise of development, and end in disappointment, be that because the development in the end didn't really matter, or because the development itself decided it didn't want to exist.
SPOILER ALERT
Example, Naruto vs. Pain. The entire akatsuki thing concentrates into this little duel, and Konoha is destroyed, Loads of important people die, Naruto appears to mature as a leader, and the entire thing reeks of ending.
Then everyone's resurrected cause Naruto knows how to sweet talk his enemy into self-sacrificial suicide. Everyone who died is brought back to life (except one, who died earlier), and the village goes about it's business as if it was just a tornado that blew through.
SPOILER DONE
Let me ask you this, would Romeo and Juliet have been better if at the end, Juliet woke up and said ""jk! lolz,"" and then wandered off with Romeo, who also had woken up, and gave some half-assed speech explaining how their love could defeat even death. If your answer was anything aside from NO, then please feel free to stop reading and enjoy Naruto Shippuuden to the fullest.
If yes, then you are sane, and you will not appreciate this anime after a while. The strategy that everyone enjoyed is slowly replaced by sheer power, leaving a horrible Bleach/DBZ feeling to it. I mean, remember when Naruto and sasuke teamed up against Zabuza and he hid in the shuriken shadow? That was cool! It caught you off guard, and was mentally stimulating! Now imagine if that scenario had ended with Naruto raging out and beating up Zabuza just because it'll lead to an end of the arc. It loses it's touch doesn't it? That's what Shippuuden ends up doing, and it's terribly dissapointing. The plot takes some turns, but overall decides that even it would have rather gone straight, and the character development... actually improves slightly, but that's not what you're watching Naruto for. And besides, the best characters get less cameos anyways, so... meh.
Art:
Shippuuden has good quality artwork, that much you can give it. But art doesn't really matter much towards enjoyment. If anything, it's only important during fights, and I guess it gets the job done and then some, they had the budget and they didn't cheap out.
Sound:
Soundtrack works to establish mood, op and end are enjoyable, and characters have suiting voices. Sound is A-OK.
Character:
Certain characters (main only) have good development, and some new ones show up, but honestly, I miss Shikamaru. I know he shows up, but he doesn't do anything anymore. I miss having characters actually matter. They got all serious, and it's lost it's fun factor.
Enjoyment:
If you can't tell from my review being full of sunshine and farts, Naruto Shippuuden starts out enjoyable, and then turns sour. I dropped it for a reason. If you don't get it, read the story section again.
Overall:
There are other anime more worth your time than Naruto Shippuuden. If you want to find out how the story ends, pick up the manga, it's faster anyways.",5
"
                This anime is much better then the first series (naruto)  the story is much more interesting and the fight scenes are much better also.  The fillers do get annoying in Shippuuden but not nearly as annoying as Naruto's fillers did.  Naruto Shippuuden is a typical shounen anime and I don't think that any of them should really get 10 overall.  But Naruto/ and Shippuuden has just a warm and interesting story that you just cant help but love.  One of my all time favorites for sure.

"
                Naruto Shippuuden. One of the most popular anime series to ever be created. But did you see what I said? I said popular. Not best, not deepest, and not the saddest. But it is far from being, and I mean far, a bad anime. I came on to MAL completely surprised when I saw that it was rated #510, and even more so that Naruto was #800 something. I sat and thought ""why in the world is it rated so low?"". I looked around on MAL for a little while, and I figured out that there are a couple reasons it is so bagged on.
                  1. Filler. People decide that because Naruto has more filler than the other ""Big 3"" that it has a horrible plot and deserves a 5 for a score. To you people that do that, you should be ashamed. Where do you get off rating a wonderful anime like this one, a 5 because you think there are too many fillers? It's just stupid, honestly. 2. People like to throw rocks at things that shine. I've talked to people who, no joke here, rate low because it is popular. That isn't as common here, but I still see it. and 3. People come in to Naruto already thinking they're going to hate it. News flash, if you come in like that, you come in looking for flaws. And trust me, you will find flaws, Naruto is definitely not perfect. Although, those flaws don't merit this anime the score it has here. 
That's all I wanted to say. I didn't come here to talk up Naruto, I came to defend it. And sure, you can call me a fanboy. You'd be right, but I'm not so ""fanboyish"" to let it get in the way of my judgment. 
I've decided that I wont make this into a ""real"" review because I'm satisfied with the other reviews. I just really wanted to get that off my chest.",9
"
                This Tv Anime Series is the most amazing one out there. Dont get me wrong i do agree with many people that there can be one to many fillers but that shouldnt sway your judgement of this amazing anime.
Story: The story is just amazing it plays out great even if it has one or two fillers before they get to the real stuff the action ect. Everything fits and it is quick witted when it comes to connecting the dots.
Art: What can i say? Its great art for anime imo. The fight scenes are nice and clean art as well overal put together well
Sound: I
                  really Think the sound overall is very good in this series it all fits and you dont find off beat rhythmes
Characters: The characters are amazing there arent many that dont play a full part in this series. 
Enjoyment: Really whats not to enjoy? This has all of it Action, Adventure, And its just great to see ninjas doing all sorts of amazing jutsu's it really is entertaning.
Overall: Overall this is anime satisfys your every need. I really am astonished to see its rating i feel its VERY under rated and is a most see for all",10
"
                TL;DR
+ some OP and ED songs
+ short-living cool moments
- fillers and flashbacks
- visuals, all of them
- overused sound assets
- pacing and episode direction
Story
Story continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable.
Story in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is
                  blinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination.
Art
Animation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the ""characters move so fast""... Right.
Background images could be split into 3 types - trees, village, cave. None of these are eye candies really.
Sound
Personally, more often than not I enjoyed opening and ending songs. What's worse though are background sounds. Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible, but they were nice to listen to the first million times. They've become something like a trademark now and watching the episodes muted wouldn't wouldn't make any difference as you can easily guess what'll play.
Voice acting has been ok at best. Naruto is still voiced by a lady.
Character
Characters didn't change at all at start, except they grew bigger and stronger. A lot later there's some development going on, but only between 2 main characters. It's still very refreshing to see though.
So basically, Naruto is still gutsy dude who wants to be the very best and Sasuke is still darkness. That's about it.
Enjoyment
I enjoyed few nice battles or moments. Unfortunately, most of these were partially or completely destroyed by horrible pacing and animation. Most of the rest can be easily skipped.
Overall
Started off as ""ok"", but for a long time now, this show has been a mass produced garbage made just to milk more money from fans. The only way an episode can keep my attention is if I triple the playback speed.
I suggest you watch this ONLY if you haven't seen the previous season and stop as soon as you start getting bored, because trust me, it will only get worse. Whether we like it or not, Naruto is a big piece of anime history and it shold be experienced by all fans (at least a bit).",3
"
                Like many people know Naruto it's one of the most famous animes and a smash-hit manga that sold 5 million of copies or more just in U.S. and besides that it's one my favorite animes that I could watch and rewatch it many times. Although many people say that it's not so good as they expect it i think Naruto and Naruto Shippuden ( but more this one) it's that kind of anime that we learn something usefull to our lifes since muscular strenght until the strenght that comes from our Heart, and that can't be paid at any circumstances.
If you're thinking in starting to
                  see it I advise you to do it because it's that kind of anime that when we stop watching and then we have 20 episodes of delay we can't stop watching, and yes it sure has a lot of fillers but you don't have to watch it.",9
"
                Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. 
Shippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite
                  of the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja. 
It is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. 
While Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant. 
This is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. 
There are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack. It has a more serious tone to it which add to the intensity of the situation.
If you are a fan of anime's such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Rurouni Kenshin, Samurai 7, Pokemon. There is a massive possibility you will like it Shippuden. If you have watched the first series then you will adore it as in my opinion this sequel is even better.

                [Story]
Great story, won't put too much because I wouldn't want to spoil anything.
The story of Naruto Shippuden follows a few years after the events of the original series.
Naruto, the main protagonist, is a ninja that everyone loves.  He is goofy, nice, not always the sharpest tool in the shed, but determined to help the people he cares about and gain the respect of the people in his village, never straying from his path to become the Hokage. (Hokage = Leader of the village)
Naruto is a Jinchuuriki, or a person who has one of the nine mystical tailed beasts sealed inside of him.  This
                  often caused him great grief and sorrow early on in his life because the villagers feared and hated him for what he was.  He occasionally has bouts with the nine-tailed beast inside of him, usually over control of his body and the use of it's evil power or chakra.
In Shippuden, a lot of the focus is geared towards the Akatsuki, an evil organisation with a plan (not revealing) and Naruto's childhood rival and ""friend"" Sasuke.
I'm done typing about the story, so if you want more, watch the show and you'll quickly pick up what's going on.
[Sound]
A sound effect for everything, like there should be.
The ambient sounds and situational music haven't changed in forever+2.
They were good when the series started and that hasn't changed, I only give it a 7 for never ever ever ever changing.
[Art]
Well they don't change clothes, so they must either not sweat or have really great hygiene.
I'm not one to judge art too harshly, but the angles are good and you can usually tell what's going on in a fight.
[Character/Hate]
Main characters:
Naruto - Pretty much described in the [Story] section.
Sasuke - Emotional, tormented, get's exponentially stronger every time you see him.  Sasuke is Naruto's childhood rival and ""friend"" that Naruto is always trying to save.  Sasuke has a horribly tragic beginning in which his whole clan was slain by his brother who then taunts him to grow spiteful and strong to eventually come and get revenge on him.
Tobi (No spoiler) - A member of the Akatski with a plan. All I can say when putting the words ""no spoiler"" in it.
Won't go on about the side characters, except for this following hate part:
The characters are great for the most part, except for Sakura... ok, pretty much every female ninja.
All the female ninjas in the series are portrayed as weak, emotional, annoying, bothersome, in-the-way, etc..  overall useless individuasl in a male oriented ninja world.
Sakura does nothing in fights other than get in the way and attempt to heal people (pretty much always failing) at the end.  When she's not failing, she's punching our friendly protagonist in the face and being an all around bitch.
Hinata is portrayed as thinking of Naruto all the time, like she has no life apart from her childhood crush, except from when she's being put down at home for being a girl.
Ino, short story, she's a bitch that you could never want to relate to.
I'd have to say the only women in the whole series that isn't a total failure is Tsunade, because she doesn't take shit from anyone.  She still has her occasional emotional breakdown though.
[Cons/Hate]
First off, I love this series to death.  
The five minute episodes go by so fast, and I say five minutes because that's about all the time in each episode that isn't dedicated to some flashback of the last episode's flashback.
When the plot is actually being advanced, it's exciting and attention holding.
Unfortunately the show is also so entangled with filler episodes, which I skip, so much so that it feels like they make an episode once a  month!
[Overall]
Great show, been following it weekly since the original Naruto series first aired.  If you are looking for something entertaining, this could very well be it.
This show would be great if you just start watching because you can browse through the currently 254 episodes, skipping over countless fillers and flashbacks, and actually enjoy the advancing plot, exciting battles, and interesting twists.
Even though I consider Shippuden superior to the original series, I would recommend watching the original first to get some background as to what is going on, or you can actually watch the flashbacks.
10/10 - I hope Naruto Shippuden stays alive.",10

                Naruto: Shippuuden review
Naruto: Shippuuden is one of the most famous anime of all time, but sometime, being famous doesn’t mean it is good. People generally just base their opinion on what they liked but not on what they disliked about Naruto so that’s why you might have heard that it is a good show. If people love so much this anime, it is basically just because they found it entertaining or because they grew up with it, but if we look at it objectively we can clearly see that it is a huge waste of time and attention.
First, the main story line is about Naruto
                  dealing with Obito’s past. Let me explain myself, Obito was in love with a girl called Rin when he was around twelve years old. That girl died because she had a beast sealed inside of her that was supposed to destroy her village. Instead of coming back to Konoha, she decided to kill herself to save some life. Even if she suicides, Obito couldn’t bear it so since that day he decided to avenge her by destroying the ninja world. Naruto will have to counter all his plan to save the ninja world and his precious comrades. So what sucks about this is that Obito is now a lot older and still didn’t get over it, which is just stupid. Almost everything that’s going to happen in this anime was indirectly or directly because of that incident that happened many years ago. It is so exaggerated, the Akatsuki exist because of Obito and there will be another Great Ninja War that last for more than the half of the anime (which is 500 episodes!). 
Second, the psychology of all the characters is messed up. You will learn the story of a lot of them and it might seem like a good thing at the beginning because it justified the fact that some of them are evil. In facts, it makes the anime last a lot longer for no reason because they all have the same story. There is more than one hundred characters and none of them has a unique story, including Naruto they are all thinking the same way so they all doing the same thing. Here’s a few of the characters story that you’ll see many times:
1.	The character loses someone he holds dear, so he will want to avenge him by destroying the responsible and his village (Ex: Obito, Nagato, all the member of the Akatsuki)
2.	The character is a total failure for martial arts and has a genius (a genius in Naruto is only someone who his not totally stupid cause they are honestly never doing anything smart) in his team, so he’ll try to surpass him and become hokage (Ex: Obito, Naruto, Guy sensei).
Third, as I said before it is too long for no reason, but not only because of all the unnecessary character’s story. A fight in Naruto: Shippuuden can last for many episodes because of all the efforts of the director that wanted to make it epic. I remember that fight against Orochimaru that was like 4 episodes and two of them were basically Naruto standing in the middle of a bridge just to show the power of his beast and Orochimaru talking to Naruto in beast form that can’t answer him back. All the things that Orochimaru said were useless, it was only a reaction to Naruto’s power. Another proof of that is clearly the Ninja war that last for hundreds of episodes. Every time that Naruto’s side finally succeed at beating Obito or Madara, there will be a stupid reason for them to come back with more strength. You’ll see that those two will be beaten two or three times each, but there’s always an excuse for them to recover. 
Fourth, there are a lot of character (especially girls) that are useless. Sakura for example which should be one of the three principal characters after Naruto and Sasuke isn’t doing anything and gives nothing to make the story go further. She is only in love with Sasuke since she saw him and always try to stop Naruto that want to bring him back to the village. Pretty much every female Ninja student in this anime exist because they love someone or just because some teams miss a girl. Even the Hokage (the chief of the village) is useless. She is one of the most unqualified person to take that role. She is very weak and dumb, the only thing she knows to do is how to lose a fight and give orders, but again she is a girl and her team needed one when she was young.
Fifth, Naruto’s way of thinking just doesn’t make sense. He is always saying that what he wants the most is to protect his friends, but you’ll see that he will excuse Obito for killing a lot of them and his parents just because the guy said that he hoped for Naruto to become Hokage. All the bad things that happened to Naruto were in some way because of Obito and he wants to forgive him because of some worthless words? That is ridiculous! Normally I wouldn’t waste time on one specific characters like this, but it is the main one, so I think it is worth mentioning. 
To conclude, I think that Naruto: Shippuuden only has one quality, it is entertaining. Unfortunately, this one isn’t enough to make this anime a good one because of all the defaults that it has. If you are looking for an anime that has a good story, good characters, relationships with real feelings or some interesting psychology, you are not at the good place because it is too simple, too repetitive and doesn’t feel real for a bit. If you are interested, I can suggest you Katanagatari which has some theme in common with Naruto: Shippuuden but certainly a lot more mastered. Also, you can go look at Ranma ½ that inspired Naruto, a little bit too much in my opinion (It is a lot better, but not a masterpiece).",3
"
                Naruto is and always will be one of the great long shonen series out of all the shonen series. It has provided a story that still makes its fans wanting more, it has revived criticism for its filler but when filler is not being aired  it is excellent.
Story 10/10
Naruto Shippuuden is the sequel of the first series of naruto and continues on from when naruto goes to train with his personal sensei jiriya so he can get stronger to find and rescue his best friend and rival sasuke. But the story of naruto becomes much more than that as the series progresses with so
                  many unexpected twists and turns. If you want a good story i strongly recommend this anime.
Art 7/10
Naruto has shown that is has many strong points when it comes to animation but when it comes to consistency of quality in animation it dose not fair to well. The anime has had moments when the quality has strongly declined (Battle of Pain) but most of the time the anime keeps up the quality.
Sound 9/10
The sound fx of Naruto Shippuden to the soundtracks and sounds of attacks are nothing short of awesome. The music playing while people are fighting in the anime have an elegant sound to them and gives a nice feeling of relaxation while watching the fight unfold.
Character 10/10
 The Characters are nothing short of amusing and interesting every single one of the are different and they all have different goals in mind. Which leaves you wondering in naruto shippuden every time a new character come on screen you become intrigued about what the character will be like.
Enjoyment 10/10 
I Saw the original series for the first time in 2006 from a recommendation from a friend and i loved it after a few episodes once i finished i had to go on into shippuuden which was twice as good. The original naruto was differently a calm before the storm for shippuden because of the amount of enjoyment that shippuden gave later on.
Over al 10/10
I would recommend this series to anyone in a heart beat regard less of their anime preference.",10
"
                Where to start ¬_¬
The series is full of action and comedy, lovable characters and great build ups. The story itself is very clever and full of twists.
However. THE FILLER IS F*****G stupid... yes it was great to see Naruto fight ""the bad guy"" but then, when you think you will see the rest of the story, like 20 episodes of filler are chucked at you. NOT SO GOOD. 
Overall i love Shippuuden, and actually find it better than the original Naruto, the filler is once again... unreal
thank you for reading ^_^

                OK, this is my first review.
So far in Naruto Shippuuden, I got to say I enjoyed it but most find it slow because the days it's being aired and you have to wait 1-2 weeks. I, for one, read the manga, which is really starting to yet interesting but I also watch the anime, when the episodes come out. There are some who are starting to dislike Naruto Shippuuden because of &quot;fillers&quot; and yeah.
Overall, I find the animation similar to the original Naruto, but there were some changes in it, too. There is and gonna be more action in Naruto Shippuuden, I can tell, since
                  I read the manga, some do too. If you are a Naruto fan and just can't wait until the new releases for the episodes, I suggest to read the manga, there are some sites online like; onemanga.com. If you've seen the latest release of Naruto Shippuden, which is episode 27, you should start on Chapter 276. But it would be nice to keep up with the new releases of the episodes and chapters.
The new releases of chapters also take 1, sometimes 2, weeks to be release, similar to the episodes' releases, but the manga is way far ahead.
The Characters in Naruto are totally awesome and have interesting powers/skills/techniques, well, the characters that are going to appear, later on in Naruto Shippuuden, so the excitement of Shippuuden only just begun, there's much more that's gonna happen, Enjoy!
I hope I did okay for my first review.",10

                        *********it's not a review it is just a oneway conversation from my heart********** and yes it is has spoilers 
Today at 5 o'clock in the evening something came to an end it was series which I cherished for the longest time since I can remember with the end of the series I want to share something with some one whoever they may be. I clearly remember the first ep of naruto which I ever watched its was a episode from the chunin exam when naruto is writing the test which he doesn't know but the way he
                  handles the situation was pure epic then I watched the first season of the series the zabuza arc and I was star strucked. The strong desire of the main character to be acknowledged by by his village and his friends was something that resonated with my thinking's. Then the series was such a great part of my life that I cannot put it into words
When naruto cried I also feel the pain when he work hard he inspired me to do the same and when he achieved some thing it made me so happy that tears started to flow from my eyes
There were many moments  which I will never forget like say for instance 
The first time he defeats neji after he wins he takes a victory lap around the arena and everyone in the audience is just shocked to see him win. At that time I was feeling like this is what I want to be. And the infamous scene from after naruto returns the village after defeting pain and the scene in which iruka is telling his story was so heart touching that it made me proud. 
The story itself was so good that I can overlook many things 
The back story of naruto was so sad I clearly remember the ep 'thank you' in which he meets with his mother it was just so beautiful 
At this point you may be thinking that he is just overestimating the series so yes I am. But I too cannot ignore the curse which was making a epic series a avrg one 'filler' it was bullshit pure bulshit, no no it was worse the bullshit
Only the novel adaptations were worth mentioning. 
But living that aside it was a good series and for me a inspirational one
So seeing the last episode made me a bit emotional it was 9 years of journey for me and yes I am happy that it ended but I also feel a bit sad 
So if you have not watched naruto a you feel that you are a failure I think you should give it a try Bcz I know if you can connect with it you will not be disappointed.",10
"
                How do I even sum up this series? How can I review something so special to me? Still, it must be done, so let me tell you why Naruto is a series you can't leave on your PTW list. 
Let's start with the basics: sound and art. Naruto (especially Shippuuden) has one of the best soundtracks in anime. Not only with its openings and endings, but its OST songs fit the anime and its tone better than any other anime I've seen. The art is GORGEOUS. Again, especially in Shippuuden because it's more recent compared to the older animation of the original Naruto series. The
                  lighting effects and bright colors make every scene entrancing. 
I don't know whether to talk about the story or the characters next because both are as high quality as high quality can be, but I'll start with the characters. You can't FIND development like this anywhere else. For one thing, each character is indisputably unique, and it's nice to watch an anime in which you can find a piece of yourself in every character. Also, each of their stories-- heroes and villains alike-- was developed with such care that you can't help but be interested. More than both of those things, though, the sheer power that these characters hold is what really makes them remarkable. Not physical power (though, that type of power gets developed really nicely and realistically throughout the series as well), but mental power. These characters are written with goals and convictions that bring them to life in a way that will capture your heart. You'll become addicted to the characters simply because they give everything all they've got.
Now, finally, we come to the story. This is going to be hard to talk about without getting detailed, so I'll keep it as brief as I can by saying this: this story is special. It isn't always unpredictable, and things don't always end happily, but the journey you'll take is-- dare I say-- one of the best you'll ever take. The care that was put into developing this story so that it had the most impact it could have must have been immense. This very well might be the only story I've ever experienced in which I didn't want to skip ahead to see the ending at some point. Every part of the story was important and made me feel so lucky to have found a story like it; I wanted to savor it as long as I could. The story itself is an art piece. 
A lot of that was my emotions reviewing the anime and not actual critiques, but isn't that more convincing? Naruto has become so special to me, and I'm really, really glad that I got past my assumptions about it beforehand and took the plunge to watch it. I don't think I'll ever find something quite like this again-- and that's why it's so beautiful. Please watch this if you're even a little curious because it'll change your life, I promise you.

"
                Naruto Shippuden. One of the most hated series that is super popular. Why is it so hated? No real reason to be honest. Atleast that is what I believe. But don't worry I am not calling anyone who hate it 'morons' or whatever i'm just saying I 'think' it should NOT be as hated as it is. Not even CLOSE. I myself though think that episodes 1-110 aren't THAT good but after that is when it starts to become a 10/10 anime.
I will get on to the why. And don't worry I will not make it too long since I think people won't read it
                  all meaning it will all probably go to a big waste of time.
I will not give a summary of the series because you can just read it in the main page or pretty much anywhere else.
OK now I'll say why I gave it a 10. (Scored FILLER-FREE).
Animation (for the most part) gets a 10 and the music gets a 10 too (i also believe EVERYONE should give this a 10 music wise). I believe it has the best music ever along with One Piece CLOSELY beating the music of Pokemon, Bleach and Fairy Tail. The story gets incredible as it progresses and so does the level of enjoyment. Naruto and Sakura become better characters than before but Sasuke declines character wise (that's a given though since he does turn into a heartless villain). All the other characters are as awesome as they were from before (I myself only don't like Ino). The akatsuki are the main villains of the series and in my opinion best villains ever (beating Phantom Troupe and Homunculus  by a LITTLE). They have unique special abilities and are VERY fun to watch. And there's Sai, Sasuke's well ... replacement and he is actually not a bad character at all either especially as the story progresses. The action is superb and VERY entertaining and at times you don't know who is going to die (not mentioning names). Sometimes the action is clever too. A lot of strategy is going on in them. So as a result from these things there is too much suspense in it for words. It is unpredictable and VERY suspenseful. They are in such situations at times that you do not know how the problem might get solved.
Now I will counter the negative things it might have/people say it has but some reasons might not be good. 
First problem people say it has- Some parts are RIP-OFF from hxh (both). I have watched hunter x hunter 2011 (my 2nd favourite anime if anyone is wondering where it goes in my personal rank) but I do not at all think this series is a ripoff of Hunter X. The whole eye deal is similar. But it is not a copy.More like inspiration. a copy is doing it exactly like it was but the eye deal in Naruto has a different twist and special things added to it. Like i'm pretty sure Kishimoto (the author of Naruto) knows that something this big will be noticed. Why did he do it? Because he knows it's no big deal or that it shouldn't be. And I haven't heard the author of hunter x complaining to him either so yeah Naruto is not a copy of hxh at all. And to anybody who mentions the hunter exam and Chuunin exam rewatch both they are VERY different. The concept (again) might have been taken but the actual content is EXTREMELY different. 
Second problem people say it has- FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. Naruto doesn't have too many enjoyable ones but some (Chikara arc for example) are very good (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of Naruto (Shippuden in this case) filler' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip.
Third problem people say it has- the length. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 4 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times).
Anyways I know there might be reasons you will disagree with but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this a 10. Action, suspense, great animation, it is almost perfect (for me). 
Finally, I hope you enjoyed the review (took me quite a lot of time to do it) and that you give it a chance (especially from episode 110). Before that it is enjoyable but I find from episode 110 it's MIND-BLOWING.",10
"
                this is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. 
There are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack. It has a more serious tone to it which add to the intensity of the situation.
              ",10
"
                I find the series enjoyable and captivating at times although it does occasionally lose track of the main story due to filler episodes and becomes quite dull when it slows down a bit, it will frequently pull you back with spectacular fights and hilarious character situations that will keep you watching.
Overall I recommend this anime because it makes you feel almost as though your are standing next to the characters, fighting alongside them and makes you hungry for ramen...
You will often find yourself getting attached to characters, whether it's because they are similar to you or you like the depth of their character you will
                  find yourself rooting for them whenever they are in trouble.",8
"
                Although this series might not have started out as well as everyone had anticipated. The series has come a long way, and has me sitting here every week waiting for a new episode at this point. The story started slow, but they truly have sewn a masterpiece.
              ",10
"
                Back in high school, I was an avid Naruto fan. I discovered the series when I was 14 years old and binged it all in 2 weeks, and started Shippuuden soon after.  I loved it at first, and revered it during the Pain arc, but soon after I found the show started to decline in quality. And now looking back, I find the show had pretty serious problems throughout its run.
Just to get this out of the way, the egregious amounts of filler amidst very few canon episodes as well as a lot of episodes consisting of 70% flashbacks and 30% actual content is
                  seriously off-putting. 
Yes, I know Naruto spent his childhood alone on a swing-set; no, I don't have to see that scene for the billionth time. 
These aspects became so unbearable that I (and many of my friends) ended up dropping the show halfway through the Great War arc and just read the manga chapters whenever they would come out. Doing this made me realize how poorly the pacing and execution of that last arc was handled, and when I eventually went back to catch up on what I missed, I wasn't surprised to find these errors hadn't been rectified at all.
I think there's a common theme to be had in considering the series that is Shippuuden: inconsistency. In almost every aspect here, Naruto excels at some point in time and then fails to deliver otherwise. The series is definitely one of highs and lows, and I think the lows have overwhelmed whatever high points the series ever had.
Story: 6/10. Our first look at the inconsistency of Shippuuden is targeted at how the various arcs vary in quality and immersion. I want to talk about what I consider the highest point and lowest point of the series: the Pain arc and the Great War arc (respectively).
The Pain arc was a beautifully told story focusing on themes of abandonment, true peace, war, perseverance and acceptance. We saw amazing character development in Naruto: from the loss of his mentor/friend/father-figure to his ability to finally surpass his limitations and become a great ninja, it seems this was what the whole show had been built up to. Furthermore, we had an amazing villain to complement Naruto: Pain. A rather intriguing villain who we can empathize with, Pain and his tragedy really helped build on the themes of the arc. He challenged Naruto, both in physical prowess and personal philosophy, and through it all Naruto was able to learn what he holds dear. All in all, a really great arc; not without its flaws, but still a great story well told. 
Then comes the Great War arc, which is 1) too drawn out, 2) ignores character development and replaces it with obscure power-ups, 3) ignores 99% of the interesting cast to focus only on characters with special eye powers and Naruto, 4) has too many villains, each one diluting the significance of the other. 
This arc didn't need Kaguya. Obito and Madara were fine villains on their own, and whatever themes the arc wanted to handle could've been well done using only them. Once Kaguya is introduced, we go into the territory of power creep, bs powerups and no one being able to keep up with the villain unless 1) they're a main character like Naruto, 2) they have special eyes like Sasuke, or 3) they randomly get god powers (i.e. both Naruto and Sasuke). Chakra was such a great power system in the original Naruto that didn't model rather one-dimensional power systems, lie Ki in DBZ. It seems now that chakra unfortunately devolved into becoming glorified Ki.
As an aside, if you watched this arc while it was airing and stuck through it, I'm not sure how you did it. I watched this arc while I was an avid fan of Naruto and ignored every criticism of it, and even then I had to drop it for a time to read the manga before I could eventually get back to watching it. The filler; the flashbacks; the slow pacing: all of these put me off. When an episode is 15 minutes flashback and 5 minutes of actually story progression, the show loses sight of where it wants to go and just becomes something that beats already explored themes and concepts down your throat. 
Art: 5/10. Inconsistent once again. Some scenes are downright shoddily drawn and bland. I understand that long running shounen tend to have this problem, and we see it a lot in shows like DBSuper and One Piece, but it still holds that the art leaves something to be desired.
The show does have its moments with some pretty aesthetic character designs and well animated fights. The Pain fight is an example of pretty bad art at times, but amazing animation.
Sound: 9/10. The OST for Naruto is pretty freaking great. However, given that the show has around 20 openings and endings (maybe even more, I haven't counted), there have been a fair share of really bad and really good songs.
Character: 5/10. After the Pain arc, we see character motivations start to morph into one-dimensional determinations or become outright forgotten. The biggest offender is the Great War arc, which takes away 99% of an interesting cast to focus solely on Naruto and Sasuke and their bs powerups. 
Also, imo, Sasuke is probably the worst written character in the show. I don't want to get into an entire essay on why I think this (because trust me, I could), so I'll just list out some of my points for why I really despise him and the writing that surrounds him and his circumstances.
1) The love relationship between him and Sakura makes no sense. They literally have no chemistry together.
2) Itachi gives up his life to ensure his brother can live in peace, and Sasuke decides to start a war to honor him. Way to respect your brother's wishes. Alright buddy.
3) Dude causes grief to literally every character in the show, then pops up like it's nobody's business during the war and lets it slide that he's going to become Hokage. I actually had to pause because I burst out laughing. Did he really think he'd be taken seriously? 
4) His overbearing arrogance borders on stupidity. He attacks a 5 kage summit, ignores advice from others and then cries about the arrogance of the leaders of the hidden leaf who put Itachi through pain. You're not any better, dude.
5) My last point, his undeserved strength and the fact that his relevance to the plot hinges on that alone. Without his eyes, he would be NOTHING. Everything special about him comes from Kishimoto giving him powerup after powerup; atleast in Naruto he had to work for things like Chidori. Now, he can just fire off infinite Chidoris, summon black flames that never go out and eventually conjure up a gigantic Titan made of chakra to dispose of enemies. 
Enjoyment: 5/10. My enjoyment, as well, was inconsistent: it varied a lot while watching, from downright bored to immensely engaged. I consider the Pain arc the highest point of the series and one of the best arcs in shounen, and that arc alone deserves a 9/10 at the very least. But after that, I'm afraid the show went through a downward spiral and destroyed itself with the final arc.
Overall: 5/10. 
+ Pain arc
+ Everything up to the Pain arc is somewhat interesting
- Show falls into a downward spiral after the Pain arc and crumbles during its final arc
- The diverse and interesting cast is underused in the final arc
- Chakra loses its nuance 
- Fights after Pain become a matter of who can stack on more god power + eye powers to win
- Some sub-plots are entirely ignored and never answered in the show. 
If you really want to watch Naruto, you might have a better time now that you can skip the filler, but the pacing still leaves something to be desired. At the very least the manga fixes the pacing problem somewhat, but I still find it fails to deliver in terms of story and characters. All in all, the show was a major disappointment.",5
"
                Did you enjoy watching Naruto, or are you still reading Naruto's manga, impatiently waiting for next chapter?
Then Naruto Shippuuden is NOT for you.
As Naruto was an great anime, it's successor is just one, big soap opera. This &quot;work of art&quot; is overloaded with fillers and many sub-plots. What is more, every one fight or event is extended to the maximum possible amount of time - because of &quot;we-don't-want-to-reach-manga's-plot-so-soon&quot;.
Oh, look, it's Kakashi preparing an eye technique! In manga, it was prepared within 2 frames. In anime, it took _whole_5_eps_ to make it prepared (that's 5 weeks of waiting! o_O)
If you have plenty (I mean, very, very
                  much) of free time and you're sure NOTHING will bore you, try watching Naruto Shippuuden.",6
"
                An incredible work ethic and boundless determination should never be underestimated. 
At first glance, Naruto Shippuuden, the continuation of Naruto, has a few noticeable differences. Firstly, Shippuuden shows its complexity and serious undertone early on in the series, through the obvious change in Naruto’s personality. And secondly, protagonist is easily defined as Naruto, opposed to our duo of Naruto and Sasuke in the previous season.
The story of Shippuuden is driven through the ploy of the Akatsuki, whom are fixated on capturing the jinchuriki and extracting the tailed beasts within. The canonical plot of Shippuuden is definitely attention grabbing, through the use multiple plot twists and
                  numerous life or death situations. The non-canon plot however, is not so great. Overused flashbacks, dwelling on insignificant season one plot, and the apparent need to remind us of events that take place no less than a dozen episodes ago gets tiresome, quickly. It’s truly a shame that the amount of filler in Shippuuden is so high, because the canon portion is outstanding. 
Once the storyline unfolds after a few episodes the character cast of Shippuuden presents great depth and variety. Each of the reoccurring Hidden Leaf Village shinobi and kunoichi are developed to a great extent, they each have a unique back story and you’re almost certain to find someone you can relate to, if not, become attached to. The ninja of the other main villages and the antagonists all display distinctive features that allow them to be memorable, be it the untouchable Kazekage, Gaara or the cunning missing-nin Orochimaru.
The quality of artwork in Shippuuden’s canonical differs greatly from the non-canon. It’s painfully obvious that the filler in Shippuuden is of a lower standard than its counterpart. With that being said, in the main storyline, Studio Pierrot has done a great job. Battle animations are fluid and eye-catching, the scenery is vivid and emotions are portrayed outstandingly. 
Simply, an outstanding soundtrack, those are the first words that come to mind when I think of Shippuuden. With outstanding openings such as OP3 “Blue Bird” almost welcoming you into an episode with open arms, and endings such as ED12 leaving you begging for more, the soundtrack of Shippuuden is definitely a memorable one. The composer Yasuharu Takanashi incorporates gritty strings, rhythmic percussion, penetrating woodwind instrumentals that captivate the moment, from intense, heart pumping battle music, to calm, vivid emotion evoking melodies, no expense is spared. 
Overall, Shippuuden is an amazing ride if you can either grind your way through the filler, or skip it entirely. The canonical plot more than makes up for the shortcomings presented though out its counterpart. Comedy is used at appropriate times, the action is engaging and the emotions are high. If I’ve learnt anything from this viewing ,it’s that sticking through the bad times with your head held high whilst never lowering your work ethic will rewarded, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely someday, believe it.",6

                My biggest problem with this anime is that it takes way too long for a scene to happen. Over the course of around 15 episodes, 2-3 fights take place. Naruto in general is known for it's &quot;Filler Arcs&quot;. I would recommend this anime, but only if you have seen the first 220 episodes of Naruto. Watching the first series; Naruto is a must in order to enjoy this anime. Overall I thought the anime was enjoyable and would Recommend it.

                FAIL
That sums up Shippuuden in one word. The animation looks cheap and the facial expressions are not noticeable. Not to mention, the lack of character development is unforgivable, especially in the sub-characters. They show up in the first episode and then disappear. Very good. -__-'
Just don't watch it. Watch something interesting like Gintama. At least it retains it's sense of humour, which is sadly lacking in this anime.

                I have to say, shippuuden's a great show, but naruto could've started shippuuden a little after the sasuke retrival arc, and skip all of the ridiculous fillers!
          But thats not the point, the point is that shippuuden's a great anime pick if you want your fill of great naruto action and comedy!(filler free, mind you) The show's pretty good itself, but one of the flaws that most animes have is theres TOO much talking and flashbacks during fights! I mean, when some ninjas bust in to an evil ninja groups lair, you dont have conversations with
                  them!!!!! But overall, the shows great! Also, it has one of the best theme songs EVER!!!! If you've finished the entire naruto series, then shippuuden's a great choice for you!",8
"
                Naruto Shippuden is the continuation of the series Naruto. Well, this is more exciting compared to the first one because it talks about a more mature Naruto. The plot is getting to its climax (according to the Mangaka) and it is really good to the point where it can make you cry. Trust me, you'll cry a lot of times because of this series. The art is good as well as the music. You'll enjoy the fight and every character. One thing that annoys me though, is the never ending fillers (because i really cant wait for the episode to continue). You wouldn't dare miss
                  Naruto Shippuden. If you enjoyed Naruto, surely You'll enjoy Naruto Shippuuden",10
"
                I really love this series. Since the first inception of Naruto in 2007 up until now, I have not been disappointed. Naruto, a seemingly trite and boistrous young man who wants to become the next Hokage in the hidden leaf is now fighting to keep his friends and family from harm from the most volatile enemy he can ever face, which is Sasuke Uchiha. A long time classmate until Sasuke's sudden disappearance to join a hidden group of cut throat killers. Naruto now finds himself closer to his nine tailed demon as a partner rather than foe because of his mothers implanted consciousness. With the
                  help of her, Naruto nears his goal of attaining the most powerful demon as his own weapon. But he still has a few fights left to overcome the obstacle. However in the middle, are his new friends from the hidden cloud clan. Bee, a man of weird intelligence which he likes to mix with rap in a conversation, helps Naruto beat his Nine tailed fox to such a degree, that the fox has no choice now but to listen. Yet their foe the Akatsuki, still need to acquire the nine tail fox in order to bring back the original demon - The ten tailed fox. All that is left is Naruto's and Bee's demons to make it happen. In the middle is Sasuke who wants nothing more than to destroy the hidden leaf, and with the akatsuki's help, his dream might be realized. Although now, with naruto's new powers of his sage mode and nine tail, sasuke will have even more of a challenge using his own dark evil demon. I think this series is great, to see naruto grow up from series episode to the next until his teen years, to now where he is virtually a full grown man, is enlightening. I have to say that for all the anime's I've watched, the story just keeps getting better and better. I can't wait until the huge final showdown between Sasuke and Naruto. But for now, I want to watch the Naruto Blood Prison movie coming soon. That should be quite the story.",10
"
                Though I really like the storyline due to reading the manga I must say i'm really disappointed with Shippuuden.  Before this series came out I couldn't wait to see it because of how good the manga is but sadly I realized it's different.  Naruto Shippuuden has got to be one of the most boring animes out.  If you think you're gonna see an action packed anime think again for the characters stare at each other for 15 minutes before anything happens.  By the time the fight starts you're already asleep.  I don't recommend anyone watch this anime simply read the
                  manga.",3
"
                If you want to be hung in suspense Shippuuden is for you.
One of the best anime pick-upd ever. Naruto Shippuuden this is the show 2.5 years after Sasuke leaves Kanoha to train with Orochimaru.
A show with action, Drama, and Fantasy was created by Masashi Kishimoto. There are currently 20 episode out but not for the US. 
I have been reading the Manga\'s and watching the episode for some time now and love it. Its keeping me in suspense waiting for the newest episode to come out when I\'ve read the manga already, but hey the shows sometime change you know lol. ",10
"
                I only read the manga of it. 
But the anime; I stopped at 263. 
This anime is the like the COD of anime.  Well, you know why. 
If you are a MAJOR Naruto fan-boy; then do not read this. And please be mature about this. I also want nice comments about this review. And it's a tad bit long. 'Tis appeal. 
Well: as known as some might say; THE MOST POPULAR ANIME IN THE WORLD. But, what I want to know is: ''Why?''. Is it because it is 'Tis an action anime or is it your favorite ongoing show? 4 years ago when
                  I was in the 8th grade; I'm in 12th now. I used to love this show. But, there is something about this such as on fan-base and applause for this. Many also compare this show to other shows even some from a different genre. Like, some person at my school said that: NARUTO IS THE BETTER THAN FRUITS BASKET BECAUSE NARUTO HAS THE NINE TAIL CHAKRA!''. And many say that this anime can kick any other anime's ass. 
And I know it's an opinion. But, this starts a bad view of mere. 
At my school, not a lot of people like anime and some don't even know what it is! Baffling! Pretty much; people at my school only care about sex, dating, and reality shows like ''Jersey Shore'' or ''My Big Redneck Island''. The few that know what anime/manga is only know about Naruto, Bleach, and the BIG 3. They are not real anime fans really. 
They are just enthusiastic about anime. 
Let is be specific here: 
Naruto lacks character development. I don't want to spoil anything; but this has to do with THREE CHARACTERS that appeared in the manga and anime; but introductions for them was bad. 
And art was fine. 
Story was dreadful because with poor character development and there is no other form of intro to us when in lookout for other parts. Trying my best not to spoil.
Sound and music was good; ARR-DUFF! 
Decent enjoyment; but the story utter.......... 
Overall with the extra 2; well whatever.... 
I don't care about fillers or deaths. 
BIG 3? Really, it also gets boring. 
And annoying characters? Well, there are some.......
The only character I like is Gaara. 
And no more: ''BELIEVE IT!'' 
That's my review.",2
"
                Okay so after seeing so many bashings of the anime i've finally had enough and decided to write my own review.
STORY:10/10
Okay so the story is the same as the original Naruto series or rather almost the same , because as the characters develop and change so does the plot. And even though everyone complains about how the whole ""Save-my-best-friend-from-the-evil"" is really cliche i have to disagree. The story is so much more than saving Sasuke if you have failed to see that then it's understandible why you don't like the anime. Every character in the anime  and their own story can be made into
                  different animes that's how interesting some of their past and future acts are.There are alot of plot twists and i don't know about you guys but i find the idea to split Naruto into two part , Naruto and Shippuuden as in young and older, is really great. Even though we have this gap of 2.5 years of training ,as the anime progresses further we ,step by step, begin to uderstand just how much the charcaters and their atitutes have changed.
ART:9.7/10
I don't know about ypu but i personally love the art , true at some point it does get lower in quality but i still like it. The fight scence are done really well ,you know the more inportant fights.Lately as the Kage Summit arc has started  the animation is really smooth and good, too.
SOUND:10/10
The openings and endings are great i don't know just how many of them i have downloaded and i listen to them ,like, everyday.The backround music is fitting too and the voice actors are doing an amazing job so far, too .I can't even imagine what it would be if the VAs change .
CHARACTERS:10/10
Okay this is one of Shippuuden;s strong points, if not the strongest. Every character,almost, has development and if you actually look into them you'll see that Naruto, the main hero,  has one of the littlest developments. We see that Sakura is stronger and she doesn't cry that much she is more independent and she has some feelings for Naruto as well , to what extent is unknown yet. Shikamaru's stories is also one of the best and we get to see just how responsible and genious he is. Sasuke is well.........Sasuke but he has changed alot too [ and i actually started to like him ] His and Itachi's stories is amazing you have to see thaat it's really complicaded and yet sp meaningfull and tragicly beautiful. Gaara has really been opening up to people , he smiles sometimes and he is friendlier and he puts alot of effort to change and act like a normal person.So as you can see most of the characters's backrounds are revealed even the Akatsuki members's and it's done in a really good way.
ENJOYMENT:10/10
Naruto/Shippuuden is one of the best animes I have evr seen , even though i used to not like it so much at one point . The fillers i have nothing to say about, every long anime has fillers so that it won't chatch up to the manga that way there won't be anything to animate.
OVERALL 10/10
I love this show mainly 'cuz at first it seems so childish and so smiple but it's actually alot more complicated and wonderful but i guess it's not really for everyone.
P.S I enjoy feedback and sorry for the grammar mistakes :)",10
"
                Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. 
Shippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite
                  of the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja.  
It is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. 
While Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant.",10
"
                Naruto makes up one of the Big 3. This review shall be for the entirety of Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden and shall contain my opinion of Naruto while trying to be as unbiased as possible. Before anyone asks, yes I have read Naruto entirely, and it was one of my first mangas/anime and I was somebody who thought Naruto was a perfect anime before realizing its fair share of flaws and before watching/reading other animes/mangas.
Progression (6): Naruto is a manga with 700 chapters... 700 CHAPTERS, it is definitely long and of course has some useless arcs which make you wonder what the point of that
                  arc was. There are also useless conversations that feel repeated between two characters in the show, and there are the past of characters remembered that are often repetitive. However, the fight sequences are done absolutely spectacularly. The hype level while major fights occur are often unreal and are often deserved because the fight scenes are quite good.
Story (4): The story of Naruto is somewhat mediocre to be very brutally honest. It is riddled with Deus Ex Machina writing, so much so that the fans have dubbed the very often Deus Ex Machina writing with a term called ""Plot no Jutsu."" There are also some plot holes within the show, but I do not find too much fault with the plot holes as any show this long shall probably have at least one plot hole. The themes of Naruto would be good if they were not told from a black and white morality viewpoint in which the victor of the battle was always correct. Also the themes are not depicted very well (as with the case of Neji believing that heritage meant everything, and oddly enough turning out to be correct in the end as we find out who Naruto's father is, even though he concludes that heritage does not matter.) The biggest theme in this show seems to be about friendship, and although it's interesting the first and second time they talk about it, it becomes too repetitive whenever all Naruto says is his answers are his friends. Humor also loses its effect in the story when it's done in the middle of the story which breaks immersion. I wouldn't mind it if it was a slight chuckle, but the fact that they are trying to make you laugh uncontrollably drives you away from the story.
Art (8): The art is not anything to write home about in Naruto, however the fight scenes are done very well. Very little times have I seen fight scenes in other anime and manga be able to compare to Naruto.
Sound (10): The music in Naruto goes very well at times with what is going on in Naruto. In fact some soundtracks are good enough to be listened to without any accompaniment of the episode, such as ""Sadness and Sorrow.""
Characters (1): My reviews are always honest, and being honest, I must be brutally honest that the characters in Naruto were AWFUL. The reason why I say this is that although there are interesting characters in the show, they become quite insignificant. My point is this, there are maybe 10 characters that matter in the entirety of Naruto, and everyone else could have never existed and the plot would have been relatively the same. Fan favorite characters such as Rock Lee or Neji become insignificant enough that towards the end of the manga, my brother (who also reads this with me) asked me who Rock Lee and Neji were. The characters that do matter are often cliche and even boring. There is the main character who falls very easily into the shonen mainstream hero archetype, there is the angry child archetype, the girl who has a crush archetype, and the wise teacher archetype.
Enjoyment (5): Although the story was not very great and the characters were terrible, at the end of the day the product was still somewhat enjoyable. The main reason why was because of the fight scenes and the fact that you get to see MAGICAL NINJAS FIGHTING. If that isn't an awesome setup for spectacular fight scenes, then I do not know what is. However, the really boring and generic story, the boring characters, and the nothing that often happened in an arc puts this score down quite a bit.
TLDR?
Pros:
*The fight sequences are spectacular
*Good soundtrack with the fight scenes
*Chuunin Exam arc has remained up to date one of the best shounen arcs I have seen
*The humor can be funny as a pick-me-up.
Cons:
*Terrible Story - Much deus ex machina (plot no jutsu) writing, or writing that feels as though it were made up in the last moment, and there are few plot holes. The plot holes are faulted slightly less by the fact that any story this long will probably have at least one plot hole.
*The length of the story is far too long. It loses much charm and interest after such long periods of time. After a while you lose immersion.
*Much filler (doesn't really apply to the manga or to those who skip filler so it does not have much minus on the review)
*Very cliche characters, and the minor characters who were fan favorites become completely irrelevant to the point where they could be nonexistent and nothing would change.
*Themes are not depicted well, especially with the black-white morality. It feels as though whoever wins the battle has the correct viewpoint which is narrow-minded.
*Plot often feels repetitive, just about everyone has lost somebody close to them in the past and have decided to become the villain because of that.
*The pacing is inconsistent. At times you'll be going down a rollercoaster ride having a character learn much at one time, other times Naruto will be yelling Sasuke's name and looking for him in a fruitless attempt to reconcile.
*The humor can also get in the way of the story. At times, the tone will be feeling more serious, but when comic relief (beyond a chuckle) happens the atmosphere is broken, immersion is lost, and you lost the chance of taking that scene very seriously.
Overall Score: 5.5/10 (Just round it up to 6/10)
***Please keep in mind that this is just a review and a personal opinion. I am just being entirely honest here about what I thought was good and what I thought was bad. This is not a hate review or a love review, and I try my best to be unbiased and write what I truly thought about the show/manga after watching/reading it. If you enjoy/hate this anime/manga, feel free to accept my thoughts on said anime/manga or discard it.",6
"
                Before I even start the review, I would like to mention this is based off of the anime only.
Story 6/10
I have to admit Shippuden starts off weak, but gets better once you reach the Hidan and Kakazu Arc which is the 5th anime arc. Then it keeps getting better until the Shinobi War Arc where both the manga and anime go way downhill. I always found Naruto had the best pacing and the most consistent story out of the big three. Even though many fillers, it wasn't until the War Arc where it started to directly affect the canon material and this was due to
                  canon episodes and filler episodes being mixed together in one arc.
Art 1/10
At first I defended Shippuden's animation because it was just new, not worse. And it was like that for a long time. Then came the famous fight between Naruto and the final Pein where the animation was just horrendous. Then it got a bit better, but when the 5 Kage Summit Arc started, animation began to go downhill. The point where I stopped defending the animation was the double episode 220 & 221. This double episode was the most inconsistent animated episode I have ever seen. Even if you are an anime only watcher, you could tell canon from filler just based on how the scene was animated. I am serious on this. But that wasn't even the worst yet! And the next example I am going to use may not be either since at this point it is only at episode 321, and unfortunately the animation may get even worse. Anyways the worst animated was episode 298. This was the first episode of a 2 episode fight; the fight Naruto and Killer B vs Itachi and Nagato. Don't get me wrong episode 2 was also bad but this was worse. Not only did the characters look like rag dolls swinging around when they fought, but Itachi didn't even look like Itachi. At least in episode 2 he looked like himself. And BTW these were canon episodes.
Sound 9/10
I've always like the openings and endings better in Shippuden than in Part One. I guess they are more of my type of music. As for the soundtrack, it was different than Part One, but I enjoyed it just as much. I have always found that the OST's in both Part 1 and 2, were matched perfectly with the scene and the music is just really overly well done.
Characters 5/10
Why I am giving this such a low score is because all attention is focused on either Naruto or Sasuke and every other character that showed promise in part one, seemed to be instantly dropped from the canon material. At least the fillers gave them a bit of spotlight, but in my opinion it was by no means enough.
Enjoyment 6/10
Why I am giving this such a low score is because of all the filler that interrupts the series. Now that wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing if the filler was good, but its just really bad; except for the Konoha History Arc which was done well.
Overall 5/10
Face it, Shippuden just isn't as good as part 1. Maybe if Masashi Kishimoto would have focused on making more characters a part of part two and he paid even a little attention to what goes on in the anime, it might have been decent.",5
"
                Story: Its the continuation of Naruto so its got alot of back story and character history, right now there is alot of people who dont like how this series is turning out and is not much to compaire to early naruto. But if you love the series and want more after the end of the first chapter of naruto then this is what you have been waiting for.
Animation: Characters have changed a bit, nothing much besides that, same style.
Sound: Same as naruto. nothing note worthy
Character: Everyone is back and they added someone new people to and it will just get better. However naruto is still
                  pretty lame so it isn\'t perfect.
Enjoyment: You get to see what happens after naruto, thumbs up to that.
overall: Meh, IMO it should have been done like the manga and they shouldnt have changed the name of the show but hey atleast they havent had a single filler because of the giant span in story between the manga and anime. Maybe all that filler was worth it...NAH :)",8
"
                Naruto: Shippuden - what can I say? I used to love this shit. Back in 2007 I would wait for the episodes, coming back from school every Friday to excitedly check whether or not the latest episode had been uploaded and subbed. Unfortunately I no longer find the series nearly as enjoyable as before.
STORY 
 I know this might anger all you angry Naruto fanboys out there, but come on guys, where is the story in Naruto: Shippuden? All it's about is our title character, Naruto, trying to bring Sasuke back from the dark side. I admit that Kishimoto isn't as bad as Kubo in
                  this department (who seems to be making the shit up as he goes along; either that or he likes trolling us (eg: ""Who said the Espada numbers go from 1-10?!?!"" *trollface*) but of course that is an entirely different matter. All I can say is that at least Kishimoto seems to plan a few weeks in advance). I wonder if people ever get bored of Naruto chasing after Sasuke. 
""But no, psyxwar, Naruto isn't just about him chasing after Sasuke!"" I hear you say. Maybe you have a point. It seems that the series is now about the Akatsuki, a criminal organisation, chasing after ""tailed beasts"", beasts of ""chakra"" (that's Naruto terminology for energy, ki, etc) with tails and their plan of world domination. I agree. There seems to be a little variation in events. This is why I have given Naruto: Shippuden a very generous score of ""2"" for Story. 
Of course, you, being the passionate, die-hard Naruto fanboy that you are, probably do not accept my reasoning and justification for giving Naruto: Shippuden a ""2"" in the Story department. Fair enough. But shouldn't you put this into perspective? Would you read a book that had a guy chasing another guy as its plot? I know I wouldn't. 
tl;dr: Naruto: Shippuden is about a guy chasing another guy
ART 
The art of the anime is okay - nothing exceptional, but pretty good nonetheless. There are countless examples of newer animes with better art and more fluid animation, but I won't hold this against Naruto: Shippuden. I've seen far worse in my years as an otaku.
SOUND
The sound is good as well, but again, nothing exceptional. I would usually skip over the same opening after watching it one or two times which usually just means it's ""meh"". There was nothing godly like ""Hare Hare Yukai"" (where I would watch that every. single. time.) 
CHARACTER
The character development and characters in general admittedly weren't that bad. Naruto definitely develops in skill (and maturity?) a fair bit over the course of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything so I won't really elaborate further on the issue of character development. I'd like to add that despite somewhat ""maturing"", this may simply be superficial as he still chases after Sasuke. He should know by now that he's a goddamn sociopath and wants to kill everyone and destroy his village. The characters are for most part unique with their own personalities. 
ENJOYMENT
Did I enjoy it? Meh, it was alright. Nothing exceptional. I feel as if I've wasted hours upon hours watching this shit though. I feel that if I wasn't such a dedicated fanboy in my youth, I would have enjoyed this series a lot less.
THE VERDICT: 4/10
""PRETTY BAD""",4

                oh ""Naruto Shippuden"".. it should've been titled ""Naruto X Sasuke: BROMANCE""  >.

"
                Here I am, typing out my second review of Naruto. Apparently I feel pretty strongly about this series, and not in a good way either. But first, let me tell you why I even bothered with this series.
If you were in middle-high school in the mid to late 2000s, then chances are you were exposed to the full brunt of the Naruto craze. I was in 5th or 6th grade at the time and all I was ever exposed to were AMVs. It wasn't until a few years later that I decided to take it upon myself to watch the series to the bitter end.
                  And what a wonderful mistake that was. Alright, with all the personal bullshit out of the way, let's get to business. Since I'm lazy, I'll just write a review for the original series by extension as well. 
Story: 3/10
About as predictable as you can imagine. Some bratty kid has an overly ambitious goal and the story revolves around him trying to reach it. And of course, he does, and some people might argue that the suspense lies in how it all happened. In other words, when there's already a foregone conclusion, all the stuff in the middle is supposed to be exciting. While the story is not necessarily ""unexciting"", it IS drawn out, bland, and riddled with plot holes. Villains are constantly revealed to be mere puppets for an increasingly more powerful villain, and all Naruto has to do to convince them to his way of thinking is talk to them. Rinse and repeat like four or five times. The story also contains way more characters than it can handle, as key characters from early on in the series, like Orochimaru, are simply forgotten in favor of other plot developments. The bigger fights can easily span over 5 episodes, leading to the action being just as slow as the plot progression. Ultimately, the story seems to take its focus off of Naruto and his journey to reach his goal and devolve into a somehow even less interesting Uchiha clan soap opera.
Art: 4/10
The art is nothing spectacular but also not totally hideous to look at. The REAL flaw lies in its animation, which fluctuates in quality and shows a lack of care on the animators' part. Everyone knows the notorious Naruto vs Pain fight, one of the most major fights in the series. In an attempt to make the animation look more fluid and polished, the character's faces and bodies are stretched and skewed and basically everything goes to hell. Plus, there's the animators' crippling inability to draw faces or objects that are far away. Some of the filler characters are either intentionally ugly or just lazily drawn, but we're not touching those. 
Sound: 7/10
The soundtrack is admittedly pretty impressive. I mean, it's normal to get sick of the opening after the tenth or so time, but some of them really shine. The music is a mix of traditional Japanese instruments and punk rock, and somehow they just mesh so well together. However, I can't particularly choose a favorite track. There are very few that really stand out, but all of them are great. However, I think I have a clear bias towards Shippuden's soundtrack, because it feels grander and more emotional. 
Character: 2/10 (this is gonna be a long one)
For me, THIS is where the series truly fails. As I said before, Naruto has way more characters than its story can handle. Stories with large casts that all have good development is possible, but this is not the case for Naruto. The first problem is that the main characters are significantly less interesting than the side characters could be. Naruto is designed to be a goofy yet charismatic guy who just draws people to him without explanation, but instead comes off as annoying and preachy. He inexplicably converts the worst of villains to his way of thinking, and it comes off as just plain stupid. It's possible to have one character be a moral compass and not have everyone worship them. Then there's Sasuke, who's designed to be a polar opposite to Naruto, but instead comes off as an edgelord. Rounding off the main cast is Sakura, who is supposed to be a strong heroine type but instead comes off a doormat who lets Sasuke toy with her emotions and relies on Naruto to do shit for her.
The main cast is simply bland, but it's the villains I was most disappointed with because of how they were handled. After shaping them up to be generic  bad guys without feeling or remorse, Kishimoto likes to trick you into feeling bad for them by slapping on a tragic backstory, usually shortly before or even after their death. Their backstories almost always involve the death of a loved one driving them to their current state. This is part of Naruto's message about forgiveness, but it still doesn't work as a narrative device. To make a villain sympathetic, you have to humanize them while they're still alive. The other reason Kishimoto fails at writing tragic villains is because their true motives are usually only presented to the audience as opposed to the characters in the story, and so the good guy never questions what they're doing (not that this would have worked anyway). In short, Kishimoto shouldn't have even bothered trying to make most of the villains sympathetic. 
Enjoyment: 4/10
As you can tell, I got bored with this series after all was said and done. Almost the entire cast was underdeveloped, and while the side characters had the most potential, they slowly but inevitably became part of the Naruto circlejerk that encompassed the entire ninja world. The animation tends to fluctuate depending on the animator's budget, and the story is exactly what you would expect from the Big Three: bland, incomplete, and way longer than it needs to be. I should mention that one of Naruto's messages is that previous generations should carve the path for the next generation to take their place. Now that its glory days have long since past, I think Naruto should do the same.",3
"
                So it goes like this - Akatsuki a criminal organization of rogue ninjas is on the move to capture all the jinchurikis. Naruto is on the move to bring Sasuke back. Sasuke is on the move to kill his brother Itachi who is an Akatsuki member. Other characters are inconsequential in the eyes of the writer.
There are a whole lot of problems with this series but the main problem is Naruto himself. Why would he go so far to bring back a dick like Sasuke who does not give a shit about him or any other person. Naruto completely sidesteps his ambition to become a
                  hokage. His new goal is to bring back Sasuke. Why the hell is Sasuke so important? For this series to work Sasuke should have been a real great guy who was loved by and who was a real hero but Sasuke is a self centered dick,piece of shit,asshole. The only persons who care about Sasuke are Naruto and Sakura and it is an established fact that both of them are retarded. So the main problem with me is the motivation of the hero which is completely illogical.
The second problem is the hero itself. Naruto is a weak person. He has had his balls removed. He is a self pitying piece of shit who cries on a drop of a hat , who treats important people like shit and sucks up to Sasuke. It would have been great if the hero had been a guy like Edward Elric because Ed also has a tendency to get emotional and well up but no one can call him a sissy pants.
However the most excruciating aspect of the series is its pacing. It just goes on and on and on. It eats up a whole episode to do something which requires merely 5 - 6 mins. There are flashbacks to remind you about what happened five minutes ago and this also happens during action sequences which kills the momentum and intensity which is already lacking.
Finally I am so angry because I think this series had so much more potential. It throws you into a complex and interesting world of ninjas but focuses on the faggots - narusasu. It gives us awesome characters like Kakashi and Ero Sennin and sidesteps them completely. They should have been the heroes. It also treats female characters like shit and portrays them as worthless (Sakura' Ten Ten,Hinata)  ***THAT IS ALL END OF RANT***",3
"
                I was all into this show back when I was was in middle school. At some point later, this show was moving too slow for me so i started going with it through the manga releases. Eventually I ran out of time and lost rhythm with the anime. I ended up finishing the manga version though. I already know what happens story wise. This manga is too slow paced and long winded. They could of made this show happen in 250 episodes combined. Both naruto and shippuuden. Instead it became a cash cow and quality suffered. It could be I fell out of love with
                  this show because perhaps my tastes changed as I got older.  It was one of my favorite shows when I first started watching it. Then when at some point during high school it just didn't attract me, it ended up feeling like a chore rather than an enjoyment. 
Story wise it started out good, then became way too repetitive and predictable. They drag things out for no reason. Its not like this show will make you think on a deeper level. The plot is basically what you would expect for a shonen anime. Nothing artistic or out of the ordinary. 
Overall, i would give this anime a 6/10. If you asked me to rate 10 years ago I would of given it an 8 or 9 out of 10.",6
"
                This thing which many of you call anime used to be cool at some point until the producers decided to just destroy with loads of fillers. Of course, it was never a top anime. The twists and the storytelling is fine but I don't understand why is everything so Cliche in it. I mean, one character dies on the battlefield and everyone just stand still and stop fighting and look at that dying character. Also the dialogues appear to be the work of 9 year old writers. The art is fine but it got very bad in some critical points like the Pain arc. (I'm
                  pretty sure everyone remembers the crappy animation and style during Naruto's fight with pain)
The character development is fine also but they ruin it by giving them too many crappy dialogues.
Overall it is good at some certain points but the story started to get worse and worse with time until recently when the story was just totally destroyed.",6
"
                Tl;dr: This title is a masterpiece, but with the excessive volume and poor quality of the filler episodes, watching the filler destroys any prolonged enjoyment.
This show starts out delivering a 10/10 experience right out of the gate. Its a more mature Naruto with some great villains and a story that keeps on delivering. The anime however falls into the ""we don't have enough content"" category and consistently pushes arc after arc of terrible filler that is by far some of the worst of any show. I don't know why the quality drops so much but it just does. 
When the show is on manga content
                  it delivers superb animation with great character and scene design, top notch voice acting and music, and an excellent plot with character development. Where I am now with watching the show (roughly episode 415) nearly 30-40% of the show has been filler and the current story line shows 1 or 2 episodes from the manga then goes off on a filler flashback tangent for 10-20 episodes, then back to 1 episode of actual story, then back to another 10 episodes of filler garbage. Specifically right now, we're on our 3rd (maybe 4th) flashback on the same character. I can't stress that enough, we're on the 4th filler line for one specific character and they don't even try to hide that they have 1) no more ideas for original story, and 2)  they've transplanted Naruto's character and personality into the other character's past. 
So basically we're watching Naruto, if Naruto was another character, in the same village. It is a complete degradation of the story back to the original Naruto series before this title grew out of the childish plots and ploys that made that show work, but also makes me never want to return to it again. Awful.
I don't have much hope for this pulling any higher than a 6/10 for me at this point. If you had asked me 100 episodes ago if I thought that I would rate this show any less than a 10, I'd tell you that you were out of your mind... I haven't seen a show tank this hard since Bleach.",6
"
                Naruto Shippuuden As you probably Know From Other Reviews, Is A continuation From The original Series &quot;Naruto&quot;, The Difference is That it takes place a few years later, When naruto is Somewhat More mature. OverAll I'd have To say that Shippuuden has to be WAY better then the original Naruto Series, not To Mention More Action Packed. There also Tends To Be less Fillers Then there was in the First Naruto Series, At the Same Time I Believe Even If Most Fillers are completly retarded, that they are Necessarily Because Without Them We Would catch up to the manga, and if we catch up with
                  the manga, Episodes would be delayed like crazy (Just Like our Friend inuyasha). Think About it We're currently 90 Chapters Behind them, And i'd say about 3-4 chapters are in each episode. That leaves around 30 or Less Weeks. at the same time, If We're going at 3 chapters a week, and they're going at 1 chapter a week, without fillers or DELAYS, We would catch up in almost no time at all!
Overall Despite The Similar Story For Every Filler, i Would Give this Anime an 8 Out Of 10",8
"
                I've seen all the episodes broadcast so far, what I can say is that it confirms the expectations I had of this anime, which is one of the best ever made.
Past the filler, the series opens in new facets in an incredible way, and the story begins to take hold, smooth as glass with great skill, as it happens in the manga. The only criticism that I can relate to the graphics, which compared to the first series has dropped in quality, not much is clear, however, an improvement was due at least as quality goes the others Anime. The sound, I would say that
                  there are not equal, along with Bleach, I think they are the best soundtracks ever made for an anime, there are no words to describe the great and splendid quality of the music that accompany the anime.
There is everything in Naruto, comedy, drama, spectacular fights, psychology ... I repeat, nothing is missing. For this reason I think it is superior to all other anime of its kind, even when compared to giants like Dragon Ball.
The last comment: Although perfection does not exist, I put 10 because I saw that the negative votes were the result of the insertion of filler which in effect have created much discussion, I shared it too, but it seems too fall into exasperation, because they are interesting and related to story.
STORY: The story starts from the drain Sasuke. The protagonist in the meantime has to train to be able to bring home his friend and defend himself against Akatsuki, an organization that wants to capture all the devils with tails, also it is precisely in this series that you discover many secrets, like the story of Uchiha’s clan or Naruto’s parents.
CHARACTERS: here are introduced to new characters very well characterized, especially the Akatsuki’s members.
FIGHTS: here fights are a bit longer and made much better than the first series, in some cases are even epic.",9
"
                Naruto Shippuuden, the sequel to Naruto, finally resumes the main story after endless amounts of filler. Some people say that this is the worst anime ever while there are also some other people who say that this is the best anime ever. After catching up to the latest episode, I can safely say that this is not the best anime and it is also not the worst anime ever.
Story : 7/10
Now before you start watching this show make sure that you must watch the prequel as you will not understand a single thing without watching the prequel. The show begins with Naruto returning to his
                  village , Konohagakure after 3 years of training with the legendary sannin Jiraiya. He looks stronger , taller and more muscular however he has not learn any new jutsu at all even after training for THREE YEARS. The organization , Akatsuki has also began to take action as they are starting to take action as they are slowly kidnapping the Jinchurikis for their plan. A new dark threat lies ahead and also Orochimaru is also planning to make Sasuke his new vessel and Naruto must save him from it before it happens. Now the story is pretty standard and good however the only thing that makes me frustrated is that there are always fillers that makes you think what the hell is this? What is the point of showing this? If only there are no fillers and freaking 10 minute flashbacks that always happen frequently this show would have been definitely less than 400 episodes.However, if you remove all the fillers and flashbacks, you will have a fantastic story which is filled with great action and some of the saddest scenes I have ever seen. Unfortunately the story is overshadowed by huge amount of fillers that is just plain annoying. Don't get me wrong, there were some fillers that were just plain awesome such as the Kakashi anbu arc which is a must watch.
Art : 7/10
The art of Naruto Shippuuden is definitely a lot better than its prequel. There were some ups and downs which there were some episodes which the art just looked plain weird but there were some episodes in which the art looked fantastic (Episode 322). Overall the art is average and there is really nothing much to complain or admire about.
Sound : 7/10
The soundtrack for Naruto Shippuuden is pretty fantastic. There were some ost that I listen to frequently (Pain's theme). The openings and endings are pretty average as there were some which is so awesome (opening 6 and 16) and there were some that were just plain awful. Overall the soundtrack is pretty decent as there were nothing to complain about.
Character : 9/10
The characters are the keypoint and the best part of the show. Each and every character always has enough depth and background which shows you why are they doing this. Naruto Uzumaki has really received so much character development and has grown from a young kid who loves to pull pranks to a strong and dependable adult. The supporting characters are all fantastic and amazing especially Uchiha Itachi and the Fourth Hokage who are both just plain awesome. My only complain about the characters is Sakura Haruno who at first looks like she has become stronger and more independent but as the story progressed, you can see that the author just doesn't give a crap about her and makes her do all the annoying things. Hell the only thing she did was yell either Naruto or Sasuke's name. The fillers character were also just annoying. For example there was this kid who keeps talking about his home which annoyed me to no end. Despite me complaining so much about the characters the characters were really great and it was really entertaining to watch them do the things they do.
Enjoyment : 6/10
To be honest I really enjoyed watching Naruto Shippuuden main story but when it comes to the fillers all my excitement goes down the drain and I just multitask while watching it. For example the current episode is also a filler which seriously pissed me off as they just showed an incredible twist then boom they suddenly show a flashback about a story which I don't give a damn about. Well the show is really enjoyable when it comes to the main plot.
Overall : 7/10
Overall Naruto Shippuuden has its ups and downs. Hell I cried like a baby so many times at some scenes which were incredibly sad. I also had goosebumps at some scenes which were just plain awesome. Naruto Shippuden is definitely a lot more mature and better than it's prequel and best part of all is that people actually die in this anime. Such a pity that the large amount of fillers and flashbacks really drags this show down as if they remove the flashbacks and fillers from the show, I would have given this show a 9/10. I hope you guys enjoyed reading my review!",7
"
                Note: Review has been suitably edited to match my views on the anime as of present time. Will have spoilers. You've been warned.
-I'm not a native english speaker, there may be some errors. Please accept my apology.-
Naruto or Naruto Shippuuden?
If I were to compare naruto and naruto shippuuden, somewhere down the line I would still prefer the former. Although I accept naruto shippuden has better fight scenes, the disappointing twists and turns have multiplied considerably too. 
Characters:
Naruto shippuuden has an army of fans for a reason, and one of the biggest reason is this - the characters. Almost all types of people will find atleast
                  one lovable character in this series, not to mention there are so many! In naruto there are no outright good or bad guys. Almost every character is very believable although sometimes they tend to get repetitive (spoiler >> all those ""healed"" by naruto pretty much have the same sob history as him. Gaara, pein..why?)
Character development:
The leads:
The thing I find irritating about the series is that sasuke is hyped too much. (haven't we had enough of mourning for sasuke while the characters grew up?) ..and yet he is nowhere to be seen. I'd prefer if the entire series stops going hush hush about him and actually have him take up proper screen space for once. The ""mystery"" charm is not working anymore, in fact its getting irritating.
In the recent episodes, naruto's significance has considerably increased which makes me happy because to me it somewhat always felt like naruto as the lead was being sidelined a bit. A character's importance is not entirely calculated by his screen space. He has grown up wonderfully after his recent encounters with akatsuki, and for once something in naruto made me feel all happy like the good ol' naruto series.
Sasuke, he seems to be really strong now after training for years under Orochimaru but much can't be said as the anime hasn't progressed so far. The manga is another ball, ofcourse. Although on personal or emotional level (whatever way you like to see it) he still remains the b@st@rd who will not even twitch for a split second before tossing naruto's feelings aside; who along with sakura is still ever so determined to bring him back home. Such level of coldness for someone who loves and cares for you so much is not ""cool"", its outright irritating.
The third and probably the most criticised one, sakura, is a complete contrast from her old days now. While the heartache of losing sasuke is still there, she's become a gem of a medical ninja AND has the much in/famous montrous strength inherited from Tsunade; which is impressive. I don't mind if she's not in the war zone fighting, as long as she is good in what she's doing which she is, so even though I didn't like sakura initially; I do not completely agree to her being criticized now. I just hope they give her more significant role to play. Also, her relation with naruto has developed considerably and in a good way.
The side sicks:
spoiler >>One thing I find really irritating with this series is that every character you start liking meets an unexpected end, and not in a good way. Sasuke is TEH GOD, naruto is the broken hearted kid in distress and sakura..well she still exists. Not that I have any grudge against sasuke, infact he used to be one of my favourites in naruto series; but I think there are far too many good characters with great potential in the series that are majorly sidelined while sasuke is being hyped to the level that it left some fans irritated. (Again I must go back to the point that if he is so important then don't have almost 100 episodes with pretty much no screen presence of him at all! Talk less and show more is what I want to say, and minus the army of fangirls if at all possible.)
Akatsuki: SPOILERZZZZZZ!!
What excited me most about naruto shippuudin is akatsuki. What excited me most about the entire naruto universe ever since I came to know something like akatsuki existed is AKATSUKI. When they were finally introduced, I was nearly ready to shed tears of joy. I guess that was one of the very rare fangirlish moment I had in my life as an otaku. But the way it happened made my jaw fall on the floor. With disappointment, that is. They make an awesome character like hidan, and he pretty much (almost) dies with not even one ""proper"" fight. It left me utterly frustated. And I just couldn't understand someone like kakuzu who survived a fight the great you-know-who got his ass handed to him just like that by naruto. Okay, naruto got stronger and all that but still, the transition was a bit too sudden for me to believe. As for sasori I really can't complain because what happened was no surprise (and one thing .. please he did not get owned by sakura. I find it so hard to believe why people keep forgetting that someone who actually knew so much about him was there too!! Defeat was only natural).. but I'd have been really happy if he had made a come back or something. Whatever, illogical demands.. heh.
Anime progress:
Another blooper is the progress of anime. With animes where anime and manga have become quite close, frequent fillers are acceptable and NEEDED. But naruto manga is like..zillion light years away from the anime then what is the need of such slow progress? I dropped naruto at ep 100 due to its slow progress and temporarily switched to other animes. Once it gains its pace, being a narutard I'm; I'll most likely be lured into watching naruto again.
Animation:
Something is wrong with naruto's quality, its not just the same anymore. The anatomy sometimes is horribly wrong .. to the point that you're able to notice it even when something really interesting is going on. The jumping from trees to trees scenes almost always look like people are flying, and some things just don't make sense anymore. Considering that the anime takes its own sweet time in progressing compared to manga, this type of quality is a major setback to fans but if you're a narutard fear not. You'll pretty much still be glued to this anime no matter how bad it gets.
Sound:
I'm one of those people who don't get bothered a lot by sound unless its so off to the point that its ruining the scene so I pretty much find the sounds okay. The openings and ending except one or two aren't all that great compared to other animes but still fine.
The biggest setback.. fansub: This is not important and perhaps not related.. but while I'm at it why not cover this too?
We all know dattebayo, if you don't then you probably don't watch naruto and shouldn't be reading this review because its full of spoilers. Anyway, the biggest setback came to me when crunchyroll took up naruto leading dattebayo to drop it. My source of watching HQ naruto was lost because DB won't sub it, crunchyroll won't air it for our country because its licensed here and I won't get to see it because for whatever xyz reasons CR doesn't know, NARUTO IS NOT ON SALE HERE! Shipping from abroad costs more than the actual anime, which is obviously not an option.  And its not just me, a huge chuck of anime fans in my country stopped watching naruto for the same reason after DB dropped it. 
In a nutshell, I think naruto shippuuden is a good anime with outstanding characters, but not-so-good priorities and balance between characters. Neverthless, it still deserves at least one time watch. Its one of the most popular anime of today's time, reviews only matter upto a limit.. don't they?",5
"
                Covering the 2nd half of Naruto manga, Shippuden adapts the teenaged years of the titular character. I wanna start this review by admitting that I am quite thankful there were people who managed to really enjoy the full road Shippuden brings. It's a long one, 500 episodes counting filler and around 300 even if you aren't. It took me 5 months to get through all the material skipping everything filler related. Now, it's actually been quite a while since I finished Shippuden (finished it last November) but I feel with a clearer head now's a better time than ever to go over everything with the
                  series.
I enjoyed very little of Naruto Shippuden.
To start with, Naruto is... Well, not a very fun protagonist to say the least. He starts off the series seeming at least a little more mature and less annoying than his original counterpart but as the series goes on his character takes a complete nosedive and it was hard for me to really enjoy him as a character by the end. His obsession with getting Sasuke back (who at the end of Naruto abandoned the Hidden Leaf to join that series' big bad in a move that would've potentially ended with his death), while understandable, feels completely unbelievable and unjustified. I feel this could've been corrected by exploring both characters similarities (which happens... 470 episodes in...) But for the majority of the series the goal of bringing back Sasuke feels so hard to care about. Another one of the main characters I enjoyed very little of was Sakura. Sakura is actually just not good. Her character in the previous series, while annoying and mostly unlikable, made sense. She was the most realistic of the cast, reacting to events how an actual 12 year old girl would in the events. Her treatment of Naruto and obsession over Sasuke back then felt understandable and it led me not to really dislike her much.
Enter Shippuden Sakura.
She starts off fairly well with some new abilities (becoming stronger plus learning to heal from Tsunade). However this only lasts for one story arc as by the second story arc she's reverted back to her old ways fairly quickly, rarely amounting to much in the story. She gets one cool moment towards the end of the Ninja World War when Team 7 reunities but not only is the scene poorly built up, aside from landing a good blow to the final villain she doesn't do too much. As a character her interactions with Naruto are dreadful. Really amounting to nothing more than Sakura deriding Naruto for being stupid, praising him for managing to do things despite that or maybe sometimes a little bit of hero worship. However she hits her absolute lowest as a character anytime something involves Sasuke. Her little childhood crush never goes away and while it doesn't seem to bad, the 5 Kage Summit arc is just... Well lemme explain.
Once Sasuke is officially labeled a rouge ninja which means he must be eradicated, the majority of the original Genin kids (Sans Naruto and of course Sasuke) decide that'll it'll be up to them to take care of Sasuke. Sakura however decides to fight him on her own. I didn't mind this because it shows a small semblance of character development. However she struggles to do so due to still being in love with him and honestly she is unable to hold a candle to a weaker Sasuke (having just killed a man after all). I find it very disappointing and really dumb of Sakura. 
Otherwise, the cast of characters in this series is VERY expansive but good luck seeing them on screen at all. Older characters that could use development or could be used in new arcs end up getting replaced with new characters who serve on simple purpose and then usually get put on a bus and forgotten anyways. Heya Sai, Taka members. The one exception to this is Shikamaru, the only member of the original Konoha 12 that isn't Naruto or Sasuke who continues to develop. He actually gets his own story arc, the first story arc in the anime to actually be above ""meh"" level. In fact, I'd say it's pretty damn good. Otherwise, the cast of characters is mostly dreadful in this arc. However I will admit: even many months later Shippuden has some great villains. Wasn't big on Orochimaru in the original series, so the amount of good villains actually surprised me. Whether they be mini-bosses like Hidan, Kakazu, that one guy who flies on a clay bird and uses explosives (forgot his name my bad) or Itachi. The bigger bads are definitely some of the best though. Pain and Obito are still my two favorite anime antagonists. Kinda surprising considering my thoughts on the rest of the series so far...
Though to be honest I still don't like Madara. He's not really bad, just very basic imo.
That being said, what about the story.
*Large exhale*
The story isn't bad when it starts off if I'm gonna be honest, but they aren't really all that great either. I felt very little reason to care about the story, a thing which I blame on it's characters. It's not until a major character dies around 70 episodes in where I actually found myself getting invested in the series. Episode 81 (The Episode titled ""Team 10"" is one of the most well directed anime episodes I believe. From there on the series begins to start getting back to original Naruto levels of decent. Sasuke's fight with Itachi, the reveal of Pain, many major plot events all culminating in ""The Pain Invasion"" as Naruto becomes the last objective of the Akatsuki's hit list. While overall the arc tends to become quite frustrating (One notable thing being that Naruto isn't around for most of the invasion, training in another dimension, which is something that could actually work in the other characters advantage as Naruto's capture would mean the end of the world. However Tsunade objects, wanting Naruto to be apart of the fight which is a bad idea in every way knowing how more experienced fighters lost to Pain and Naruto is a 16 year old). However the fight between Naruto and Pain makes up for it. A battle between two different ideas of peace with some amazing animation and Naruto's subsequent breakdown towards the end I'd quite heartbreaking. However, at the very end Naruto simply talks Pain out of his evil ways turning him good. While this is a fairly common Naruto story element and on that I defend in fact, it was poorly implimented and was the beginning of the final downfall of Shippuden. I could go on about the Fourth Great Ninja War arc but it's fairly lengthy (About 2/3's of the whole anime) and so a rant would probably be quite long. Overall the plot sets itself up as interesting but nothing interesting actually happens. I found more often the not I'd either be anticipating a singular event that was to take place in the story, or just straight up anticipating the arcs ending. 
Can I also talk about the series' animation? The art design becomes a lot softer and more exaggerated as the series continues, which I appreciate. However for the most part the characters look and move stiffly no matter where the series is. Every now and then the series gets its best animators on a single episode (mostly fights with spectacular results see Sakura vs Sasori, Sasuke vs Deidara and Naruto vs Sasuke) but this is only 5% of a 500 episode anime. The show looks DREADFUL through and throughout 
I can say though: Its soundtrack is phenomenal. Probably my favorite or second favorite soundtrack. It's a little weak at the start but by the end of the ninja world war it really hits its peak. 
Honestly what can I say about Shippuden. It really hurt to get through and unless there's some sort of Shippuden Kai, I'm never watching this series again.
Oh, but one thing before I finish this review. Don't forget how the series tore down it's whole heartwarming idea that hard work will pay off. Naruto, who was always played up as the underdog who came from nothing, turned out to be not only the chosen one, but was also related the VARIOUS strong individuals from the past (1st Hokages wife is his ancestor. Son of the 4th Hokage. Reincarnation of ninja Jesus etc).
*Sigh*
Why Kishimoto... Why...",5
"
                Naruto Shippuden is the long awaited sequel of Naruto. Naruto is a good anime that's  why it's no wonder why it became so popular,however Naruto Shippuden  ruined it.
Story: 4/10
Naruto Shippuden started off really good, at least it didn't failed everyone's expectation after the long wait. It was nice to see Naruto and the rest grew up as teenagers -with their new missions and new journey. However... as the series continue, the story started to get messed up and slowly went downhill. The story started to focus more on Naruto and Sasuke's relationship - on how Naruto wanted to keep his promise to Sakura
                  and bring Sasuke back. The fights took so long, not because a fierce fight was going on but because of the long talks during the fight.
Art: 2/10
The characters doesn't look as good as before. The animation is also really bad, it looks so dull. There were fight scenes that could've been great to watch, but because of bad animation, it became boring to watch. There are also times when the characters look distorted -especially during fight scenes.
Character: 6/10
Nothing much has change from the characters...except:
Some old characters that we thought of as cool ended up doing nothing really helpful and ended up like side characters.
There are new interesting characters but the attention for them slowly fade.
The are lots of characters that wasn't given the attention and development that they deserve.
Overall: 3/10
It is really sad... how a good series ended up being disappointing",3
"
                I would like to let people know that this anime is awesome and i grew up watching it. If your wondering why the overall is only 4 is because the creators are complete jerks.
 They are able to make masterpiece episodes but they have utterly no respect for their fans. Half of an entire season is fillers that are irrelevant to the main story. I watch this anime to see the great action and story following Naruto and his friends. Not some imagined on the spot character that brings up a over-dramatic life. 
They take more ""breaks"" than they make episodes. 
Just recently they came
                  back to the main story after a few months of fillers i have no interest in but just after that one main episode they decide to take a few weeks for a break, then they did it again.. and again.. and again.
I use to see stores with anime fan toys and souvenirs, They prohibited all their merchandise and decided to monopolize it at a overpriced retail.
I wish some other company would take over naruto and bring out its full potential instead of soliciting ratings from millions of students and swimming in their pools of yen.",4
"
                Overview:
It's OVER! Sweet Jesus it's finally over! This series had some cool characters, great music, excellent animation, and yet ended up very mediocre from the astonishing level of shark jumping bullshit! I found myself imitating a famous scene from MS3TK and simply shouting EEEENNDDD! EEEENNNNNDDDD! At the screen over and over again!
warning! Major spoilers!
Plot: 6/10
The plot started out fairly strong, created a unique and fun world, and provided us with years of light hearted adventure that casual fans and even seasoned otaku (although most won't admit it) were able to enjoy. Unfortunately, Kishimoto wasn't able to pick a single villain and develop him or her
                  into a truly great shonen antagonist. He just kept stretching out the story with villain A is just a sad sob manipulated by villain B, who is controlled by villain C, who is ruled by villain D. It became more and more absurd with every arc of the story! This was combined with more random ""heel turns"" and pointless ""face turns"" than a season of WCW wrestling. That is exactly what the character development reminded me of. Sasuke is gonna be a bad guy this week, then randomly be a good guy, wait, now he's bad again, nope lets end with him being good. Fucking Orochimaru got a face turn and chance to be a good guy! WHY!? He was the only decent, nasty villain Kishimoto ever created! Who in the FUCK wanted him to turn good?! It makes no God damn sense! Finally, Kishimoto ends the series with the absolutely POINTLESS antagonist Kaguya, who is never given any character development and simply comes out of nowhere to be the big bad guy behind everything. Kaguya is like Ultimecia from Final Fantasy 8, the bad guy that was controlling everything all along, but we don't feel anything when she dies because she was introduced so late in the story and we know so little about her that it destroys any chance of her being an effective villain. The difference is that Final Fantasy 8 had to be made on a tight schedule and rushed development can be blamed for a rushed ending. Kishimoto had over 10 years and absolutely no fucking excuse for this last minute BULLSHIT!
Character: 6/10
Naruto Shippuuden had a very wide cast of characters and pretty much everyone will find a couple of characters that they like. Unfortunately, most of the best characters were given little screen time and some of the most obnoxious characters were given WAY too much. Naruto is the main character, yet I would argue he is one of the worst characters in the whole series. He is a purely generic shonen protagonist that doesn't really have any unique or interesting character traits. We have seen the plucky young fighter who never gives up and always triumphs over evil. His name was Son Goku. Sakura got more ""time in the sun"" in Shippuuden, but never really became a likeable character. Sasuke was annoying as all hell and I just wanted Itachi to pimp slap him! The most interesting characters in my opinion were: Itachi, Gaara, Hinata, and Deidara. None of whom have enough screen time! At least Itachi got brought back briefly in the end to be a badass once again and Gaara was given some time to shine. Deidara was easily the funniest character and perfectly captured the snooty, ""art for art's sake"" kind of writer/painter. He left us too soon. Deidara will return in a new anime by ""nose towards the sky productions"" ""Tatami Galaxy 2: Fuck you casuals, this is ART!"" God I wish that would happen! Hinata was easily the most relateable character and captured the social awkwardness and nervousness that many otaku feel in daily life. Her progress towards becoming a stronger and more assertive person was one of the highlights of the entire series. Also unlike Shinji I didn't want to punch her in the face every 5 seconds! I admit this theme and character type has been done in anime before and has been done better, notably ""Welcome to the NHK"", but still she was a lot better written than most of the character roster. At least Naru/hina won out over Naru/Saku! My ship won! Fuck you team Sakura!
Art: 8/10
The art throughout Shippuuden was kept to a pretty high quality and we rarely had the piss poor animation and loops of the Sasuka Retrieval Arc and some of the other story arcs from the first Naruto series.
Music: 8/10
You can hate Naruto all you want, but the soundtrack was genuinely not bad. It isn't AMAZING like the Bebop soundtrack or anything, but it was honestly pretty good in my opinion. (raises flame shield against elitist attack).
Enjoyment: 4/10
The more this series stretched on, the more of a pain in the ass it was to read and watch. I took a long break, but finally came back and finished the manga. The anime technically hasn't finished yet, but it should wrap up in a few months.
Overall: 6/10
Now the final judgment of Naruto. Naruto....was ok. It wasn't a great series, it wasn't a very well executed series, but it wasn't terrible like so many critics today claim. It badly squandered its potential, jumped the shark 8 dozen times, and really went down hill in the last few arcs, but I couldn't really say the series sucked overall. It was just...meh, but with good art, sound, and budget to lift it above a 5 and to the land of 6/10. For me, this means that it is just slightly above average, since my average rating for the roughly 200 series I have seen is a 5.3.",6
"
                Alright, Naruto Shippuuden itself is badass. You just can't help but to love certain characters, the action is great and the emotion is there but most of the times you either won't care or you won't even notice. The music in the anime is fantastic and really gives that ninja/shinobi feel, especially due to iconic Japanese instruments such as the shamisen. Some tracks may be overused a bit, but it's not bothering in general. It just makes certain moments predictable.
Although I love the story, I can't stand the fillers and flashbacks. They use flashbacks and fillers on the most inappropriate moments. 
Let me give you
                  an example: In the middle of the final battle they will throw 12 fillers in your face.  After that they continue with the final battle for one episode, and while a character's performing a major act for the story.. he decides to have a flashback, continued with another flashback episode. Seriously, it's ridiculous. It totally ruins the atmosphere, excitement and enjoyment. They also repeat a lot of scenes from flashbacks, heck I wouldn't be surprised if some episodes are the exact same, but with the scenes in another order.
This is why I rate Naruto Shippuuden a 6 overall. I find myself saying ""AH NO"" way too often on the first frame of the ""Next time on Naruto Shippuuden!"" at the end of every episode, which isn't a good sign. Will they make it better with the episodes to come? Time will tell.",6
"
                I really, really, REALLY tried to like this show. I was a fan of Naruto (the prequel to Shippuden) and I really enjoyed it.... but trying to finish this show was as fun as watching seniors play checkers. SERIOUSLY.
Story: Ehhh it was same old Naruto plots and stories. Easily predictable and boring.  Some friend is in a pickle and Naruto goes all emotional to save him even if he met that that guy 2 minutes ago, because he wants to be hokage. Yawn. I saw enough of that in Naruto. Basically, if you watched Naruto and liked it, think of it as the same
                  thing... minus the excitement.
Art: It was no eye popper, but it surely was no total trash. The action and fighting scenes are still eye candy for actionholics, but other than that, it pretty much is what you'd call standard Naruto animation.
Sound: The sound is possibly the best part of Naruto Shippuden. The OPs are still great, expected from Naruto, and the endings weren't that shabby either... Shooting Star (the first ending) grew to be one of my most favorite endings of all time.
Character: All the characters show some development... but in an easily predictable way. Naruto ends up a BIT mature, Sakura grows ladylike... at least for her, and Sasuke grows to be more of a bastard than in Naruto. Some new faces pop up now and then... but they are as memorable as the dust in your belly button.
Enjoyment: Now this is where the opinions get diverse. Some Narutoholics will say this is that best thing since Spam and some will say that they watch this show at night just to go to sleep. I'm no Narutoholic so I'd say that the enjoyment for this show is just horrible, but it will be a way for you to waste time if you can get through all the predictable plotlines. 
Overall: Naruto Shippuden could be, should be, and WILL BE a huge disappointment for Naruto fans who enjoyed the show out of pure action enjoyment. But of course they say that 60% of Naruto watchers end up dying their hair yellow out of love for this show, so it all depends on how you look at Naruto. But overall, Naruto Shippuden isn't something you'd go crazy for. Take my word for it.

                I've been watching Naruto for a very long time. I've read the entire Manga and completed Naruto (Part 1) I've also seen a few of the movies and all the ova's and specials. 
The story is utter garbage. It's dragged out and supplemented with horribly written filler arcs. The pacing is painfully slow and unnecessary. The battles are relatively interesting but there is too much needless talk and deliberation. 
The art/animation is inconsistent and changes from episode to episode. It's usually very poorly done and while this might be good for saving money and time. Naruto is one of the most heavily marketed Anime in
                  the world, it should have enough funds to pay for decent Animation.
The characters are the best thing about this series. My personal favourites being Madara, Sasuke, Itachi, Orochimaru, Naruto, Kakashi, Hinata and Jiraiya. These characters are pretty deep and deal with their own struggles. 
The sound is pretty good. Good OP and ED's.
It's enjoyable to watch but people need to stop rating it so highly. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect and it's pretty damn overrated but it does provide me with lots of entertainment and I'm still watching after 399 episodes... I like this series but lets not pretend its as great as the classics.

"
                It's 2 and a half years since Naruto left to train with the Legendary Sanin Juraiya. You'd expect him to be bad*** right? Guess again. Naruto is still the goofy little kid who still gets his *** handed to him in every fight. What exactly has he learned? No new jutsu to be sure, just learning to control his Kyuuba. That sounds cool but it's really not. This lies a problem with character growth.  It's nonexistant in shippuuden until around episode 50 (avoiding spoilers). Naruto still wants to find Sasuke. Guess what? SASUKE WILL NVR COME BACK, GET THAT THROUGH YOU'RE THICK SKULL!!!!!
Another problem
                  is the story. Shippy progresses too slowly. Half an episode is just talking, the other half is the slow fighting. It will literally take 5 minutes just for someone to punch the other guy. And the flashbacks are just silly. Why do I need a flashback for something that happened 5 minutes ago? This has happened quite a few times. The character designs aren't bad except Ino's. She looks like a Britney Spears wannabe and who'd wanna be her?
I gave Naruto shippuuden a 7, but my review makes me sound like I hate it which is not true. Shippuuden actually has a deep story. If it progressed fast it'd be epic. More about the Akatsuki's goals are revealed and when a fight actually occurs it can become an awsome fight.
Naruto Shippuuden also has a different animation style to it that I enjoy. It sets the mood for a dark and deep story which I enjoy.
I gave it a 7 because when something good happens it becomes REALLY awsome. The story pacing just keeps it from it's true potential.",7
"
                Naruto Shippuuden seriously started off very strong for me. After that preview episode with Naruto and Sasuke facing off again I got so much hype. I got so excited as I thought this was gonna be so awesome. Like the be all to end all clash of epicness. The first two arcs were pretty damn good I'll give that. There were some tearful moments when a few of you're favorite characters were seen dying. I thought that was a good way to really get you hooked. But by the end of it Naruto Shippuuden felt like such an after thought. 
Now for me the original
                  anime got so many things right. The character development was big for some of the characters, The action was enjoyable and of course it really kept you excited for things. My only real complaints were that the filler lasted forever sometimes and it felt like it was taking too much inspiration from a lot of anime. As they were targeting the right audience for both kids and adults. It had just enough humor and serious action for all the fans.
But let me get to why Shippuden basically fails on some degree. The first point is that Naruto himself seriously lacks character development. I mean sure he does learn a new jutsu here and there. But he lacks his own sense of humor compared to the original series. It's also very hard to feel for him most of the time. The only time I ever really felt any sympathy for Naruto was when someone special to him died. I'm not going to spoil any of the big moments as if you are curious you can check it out for yourself. The rest of the other character development is take it or leave it. You'll have to decide for yourself which characters you love the most.
The storyline this time around is nothing to write home about. While I will give it something for trying to connect everything more. Also the fact that it tries to be very mature in some parts. Though its something I can't get into in general. The fights are also really awesome to some degree. It has a lot of amazing moments and it was really good. But I seriously began to lose interest after some filler arcs and when I was two or three arcs into Shippuuden. The artwork however is very good in general. I think the anime looks very sharp overall and the presentation is quite good to me. The music is great once again. With traditional Japanese music and some epic orchestra music thrown in. The presentation might be one of Shipuuden's strong points.
Overall Naruto Shippuden is something that has dissapointed me. I did really enjoy the fights to some degree. The music and artwork is also quite good as well. But to a degree this has dissapointed me so much. The emotion also feels very lacking and you could really careless about the story. But I find it very difficult to really enjoy Naruto Shippuuden in general.",5
"
                The show gave me much enjoyment for many years with the amazing fight scenes and great story. 
However the animation has gone down the toilet amazingly fast. There are very select fight scenes that occur every year or so that are well done, but the corners they've been cutting to keep animation budgets at a minimum is not well hidden. Half of the episodes are now filler that are completely intrusive and have no place in the show. The episodes are now long and drawn out with flash backs or long pauses.
I absolutely love the manga and it tears me apart to see how
                  they've animated it. The animations are now just borderline stillframes.",5
"
                The series brings some new things, and repeats some old weaknesses to the storytelling.  I'm assuming that anyone reading this has seen at least some of the original series, so please do so if you have not before reading this.
Story:  Just as there was a timeskip and gap between series in the anime, the author took a slight break between the two series too.  Which places the studio in an awkward position of when to start releasing the anime series and what pace to set.  Afterall, the reason for almost 100 filler episodes in the original series was to give the
                  manga author time to work.  Even then they are catching up frighteningly fast and are already beginning to ""pepper"" in a couple of filler arcs.  Unlike the old filler arcs however, these segue nicely into the original plot and don't stand out as much as the old ones did.
As for what happens, it picks up as Naruto returns to Konoha after 2 and a half years of training with Jiraiya.  I will say that I'm somewhat dissappointed with how little he's improved.  Pervy Sage must be a slack-off because the other characters seem to have improved a lot more than Naruto has (even though he's all around stronger, faster, etc.).  He's matured a little, but of course that leaves room for improvement.  As Jiraiya stated before filler hell settled in during the first series, he intended them to return right as Akatsuki would begin to move and Sasuke's life would be in potential danger.  That prediction is dead on as after he is back less than a day Akatsuki begins it's quest to capture all the ""jinchuriki"" (ninja who have tailed beasts within them) starting with Gaara.
You can go on your own from there.
Art: The world seems less...fresh than it did in the first series.  They, so far mind you, have stuck to the seemingly endless woods around Konoha and a brief foray in the lands of the Sand Village (Sonagakure).  The difference in character design  is fascinating, all due to the original author of course.  Both Sai and Yamato are intriguing for their lack of distinguishing features.  While all the other characters are as notable for their looks as their personalities.  Of course all the original young ninja have matured, all hanging around ~15 yo by the looks of things.  The differences are largely subtle and well done.  
Sound: This is the biggest letdown.  Not because it's poor quality, but because it's always the same 3 tracks playing.  There is no variety in music and the same ""Battle/danger"" music plays all the time.  The variety of music from the first series is gone and that is sad because the original Naruto has an excellent soundtrack.
Character:  Naruto is much the same, but tempered with maturity in that he is able to understand others (except Sakura of course) much better.  He is still obsessed with rescuing Sasuke, and is still reckless and rash.  He seems especially stagnated in comparison to the others who have all become Chunin and even Jonin.  Naruto does show maturity when he learns that Gaara has not only surpassed him but has achieved his own goal by coming Kazekage of his village (though it's later revealed it was for political reasons).
Sakura has changed the most.  One of my fav moments from the new series is how she actually becomes interested in Naruto (noting his physique has matured) but is quickly disuaded by discovering his lack of ""coolness"" (aka bragging about a ""new"" sexy jutsu to Konahamaru and telling her that she looked the same (she's ""filled out"" BTW)).
Due to 9 tailed fox's increased power within Naruto, and the fact that they are lacking Sasuke, Tsunade assigns two former ANBU members to join their squad (Kakashi ends up back in the hospital right away of course).  They are Yamato and Sai.  Yamato is the result of one of Orochimaru's experiments, which gives him the powers of the first Hokage.  These are the power of wood element (he can build a mansion in seconds) and limited control over tailed beasts, namely the nine-tailed fox by using the pendant that Tsunade gave Naruto.  Frequently they play off his amazingly blank face.  Naruto, and the viewers for that matter, find his face kinda eerie at times.  They don't hesitate to have fun with this.  He's very kind-hearted though and looks up to Kakashi, calling him Senpai (implying that he served under him in ANBU.  (note: Yamato is not his real name, but he continues to use it)
Sai, is originally planted in the group by Danzo, the leader of ANBU root and Tsunade's political nemesis within Konoha.  Trained not to show any emotion, he eventually begins to respond to Naruto and the others.  He provides a lot of comic relief by trying to interract with the others.
Enjoyment:  It's not as groundbreaking as the orignal, but the series continues to be fun.  Naruto continues to grow and mature over the (now 100 episodes) series and is even learning to better use his current jutsus, thanks to Kakashi actually involving himself in Naruto's training for the first time.  The gags continue a lot but now that characters are actually dying (other than enemies or the elderly (3rd Hokage) it's gotten more serious as well.
Overall: The series has a long ways to go, and since the author is far from finished it will be interesting how they decide to keep pace.  They are currently on their 2nd filler arc.  The first was somewhat silly, but gave everyone background on Asuma which is very important for reasons I refuse to give away at this time.  The 2nd seems to be explaining where the 3-tails jinchuriki came from so it'll be interesting to see how they handle it.
Of course the original story is very strong and fast paced.  To this date the highlight of the series has definately been when Naruto takes on Orochimaru.  It helps you appreciate just how strong Orochimaru is.
The battles with the Akatsuki have been fascinating, mostly because they have so few weaknesses and how hard the Konoha ninja have to work to defeat them.",7
"
                Naruto series is the reason why i started watching anime and Shippuden is honestly one of the best anime i've ever watched,or simply,the best. i kinda have a perfect life, unlike naruto, but i can relate to him at some point. i'm touched by how naruto is determined to work hard so that the village would acknowledge him as someone who is worth to be watched. Despite his lonely and sad childhood, he didn't let those things to overcome him to become dark, but instead, he let those sad memories as a fuel to drive him to become a better person. i love everything about
                  his character, his annoying yet funny stupidity, his unconditional love towards his friends and comrades, his endless hard work even when everything around him comes crashing down. most importantly, i love  how he use his past to understand others instead of judging them. being as strong as he is but still is humble enough to lower himself for something he believes in is just pure inspiration. from being a loner to being around many loyal friends and comrades and have the trust of all shinobi in other hidden villages. he will make an amazing hokage. this anime might be fictional, but i value this anime so much it has more meaning and depth than that. im very sad that this anime is coming to an end, but this anime and the messages it contains will forever live. 
thank you Kishimoto for this amazing journey you've shared with me and the rest of naruto's fans. Arigato",10
"
                Well I dropped this a while back, but I figure I leave a little something regarding it. Naruto was one of the first anime that I did pick up when I was actually getting serious about watching. I watched the original series, OVAs, and movies. It was ok overall, but I felt it could do something with that story. Then comes along Shippuuden, which I thought it would do expand the story and make naruto seriously epic. I was wrong. I don't even know how I managed to get to episode 255 including all those countless filler. I mean sure Bleach and One Piece have
                  fillers, but Naruto takes it to a whole different level. I really can barely recall at least 5 episodes for Naruto that were seriously epic. So on that note, no more naruto for me. I may peep the manga from time to time, but its not a priority.",5

"
                Given the voracity of the backlash against the ""not-so-bad"" rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don't think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance.
So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more
                  or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn't as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.
The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke's blandness and Naruto's charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level.
The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed.
It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn't saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto's Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.
How one feels about Naruto probably depends, in good part, on their anime viewing mileage. As a person that has been watching anime for a decade and a half, there isn't too much here that I haven't seen done better elsewhere. However, it has managed to get better as it progresses. Although uneven in most aspects, this show is a good introductory title that will likely bring many newcomers into the fold of anime fandom.
In closing, Naruto, while being better than worse without a doubt, doesn't quite succeed in being as mind-blowing as the hype-machine would have you believe.
This anime volleys between a two-star and a four-star feature depending upon your anime viewing mileage and how easily you can stomach an anime so action laden. If you are relatively new to anime and a fan of DragonBall Z and YuYu Hakusho, it is a four-star feature. Otherwise, this is a three-star series at best",1
"
                Well this time I'm writing an anime without being a fanboy or anything like that, to be honest I once dropped Shippuden in its 50's but I caught up about 300 episode in 2 weeks,and I'll be honest this 7  could be 9 if not the characters and the Art (the animation as well).
Story : I think most of all know what it's about , a teenage orphan who wants to be a hokage the strongest ninja in the village etc.. Yep this is a predictable mainstream shonen so don't expect some original mindblowing things in the story, however it has its good points
                  and bad points.Let's start with the good ones, naruto has its own pace, its charm that makes you love it, and no matter what score you give to this show , you love its simple story about the kid naruto and his adventures and misadventures. Also the fights are quite epic and exiting , getting to the bad points, the fillers, Omg the fillers, I won't talk about it more.7/10
Characters : Now getting to this point , the characters in naruto is one of the very very weak points. Most of them are useless , and apart from Naruto and probably Sasuke the development isn't really present , most of the characters are used to help naruto or to be in opposition to him finally to get by his side in the end of the arc or the fight etc.. 5/10
Art/Animation : Okay this point is really weak too ,an 8 for the art ,  Gj kishimoto , and the animation mm it's a 2/10 yeah I don't like it at all , Bj studio pierrot. so it's a 5/10.
Sound : Nothing to say , good ost, good openings , aand good endings.
Enjoyment : Now the best point of naruto , nobody can deny that this anime will have you sitting in front of te screen for hours without caring about any shit in this world in the beginning of the summer I watched about 300 episodes in 2 weeks ( already said it lol ) and that shows ust how much I enjoy this shonen stuff.
Overall : So as an enjoyable anime with its good and bad points I would recommand it to everyone even if you hate it or you don't like watch it it's probably worth your time. (7*2 +5(characters)*2 + 10 * 2 + 5 + 9)/8 = 7.25 
So it's a 7.",7

                When I first heard that will be a sequel to Naruto i thought WOW that's cool, but I hope that the filler episodes won't  apear in the new Shippuuden. But to that Later...
Story/ The story is great, many twist, many thrilled moments and so on. But that's only the main sotry from the manga. Sadly... everytime when a main arc is enden a new filler arc begins... I wouldn't complain if the filer arc would be over 2-5 episodes, but those damn fillers won't get off of my screen!!! The avarage duration is between 15-20 episodes so that means over 15 weeks of suffering
                  and bleeding... But if it wouldn't of the grat and I have to it again GREAT main story outline, the rating could be much worse...
Animation/ Well... unfortunately I have to say it's just sad... The first episodes were very good animated but as the time pased the animation gets worse and worse... But there are a few episodes that are great animated for example: Ep. 26 or 85 and the episode when team Kakashi (Yamato) meat Sasuke. First I thought WOW finally the animation gets better, but after 2-3 episodes it gets miserable again... I think it's year 2009 and not 1992... Even Dragon ball had a better animation quality and try to find how old that anime is... In my opinion animaton is the weakest part of Shippuuden
Sound/  Is very good, not better then the original Naruto but much better then other anime series. The openings and Endings are nice to hear and some openings I had to download becouse I liked them a lot. And the OST supports the episodes very well. Good JOB.
Character/  Finally the strongest site of all the Naruto series. Naruto is very well known of the deep  character outline. EVEN THE FILLER characters are well done becouse all of the characters have their own past (mostly sad). some of them are evil and some of them are moch worse and I can't think of their next move. And here we are the good characters... I'm the badguy so the goodguys are only in my way :D, but most of the good characters are losers or geniuses with a sad past and their will force them to maximum. And Naruto when he doesn't give up and tries to others believed in him then so do I. 
Enjoyment/  I have to admit that i enjoied Naruto Shippuuden a LOT and even the stupid fiilers can't change that. 
Overall/  Naruto Shippuuden is a well done sequel with some mistakes. Some of the mistakes are big and some small but the good side overhelmed the Fillers.

                I love watching Naruto series! It always gave me all different types of feels :') I'm gonna say, that it is a beautiful anime. Naruto was one of my first animes to watch and till now its one of my favorites. When I think about that soon the series of 'Naruto' will end makes me sad, because I have watched every episode of it. But because Naruto series probably will be end soon, I hope to see some Boruto series too, hehe :3 
The only problem (and some can agree with me) are the fillers arc/episode I have to say that I prefer when anime
                  is linked to the manga.. But the fillers are also  good because they tell us more about characters and show us some things that happen before. I also think that also characters from Naruto taugh us some important things in life.. for example Naruto himself has proven not to  give up on our dreams because if we work hard and won't lose the hope, our dream can come true. 
I am happy that I could watch Naruto from being an clumsly ninja, turning into a hero and hokage ♥",9
"
                ""Naruto is Naruto"" and though Ive only seen the first 5-8 episodes I would still keep watching it. The only thing you should expect from naruto is a great fight scene and a great  story. I didn't think it was that different from the older naruto. The characters do however act differently, such as naruto. Ive seen the new guy and all that. Instead of comparing this to the old naruto, you should be looking forward as things will change when he gets old and you should expect that from a series that continues as the characters get older. Things have definitely got more
                  serious but the fighting is way better. I stopped watching old naruto at episode 120 because it became to childish for me(even though I really love the series). This is why I like shippuuden. Because they have taken a more serious approach with the series. So naruto fans Id high recommended this to you: )",8

                ROAD BLOCKS IN PLOT WRITING AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM: SPECIAL ABRIDGED KISHIMOTO EDITION
1)	I created a unique main character with a great ambition, how do I make this character instantly likable?
Kishi says: I’ll let you in on a trade secret: “Tragic motherfuckin’ back-story.”  You want your character’s childhood to be filled with angst, bullying, depression, thoughts of suicide, and maybe molestation (save this one for an easy shock reveal later on!). Remember, your character in present-day needs to be NOTHING like his childhood self for he will have overcome that shitty past with the almighty “STRONG RESOLUTION”. It’s all about the compare and contrast.
                  “Good people deserve good futures”, readers love this.
2)	Every protagonist needs an antagonist. What should a good antagonist be like?
Kishi says: Polar opposite. A perfect antithesis of the main character. Have him bent onto a totally evil goal, like say... oh I donno... revenge? Also, make him sexy and make him mysterious. Chicks love that shit. And don’t you fucking forget about that tragic back-story!
3)	Should my female characters be important and useful?
Kishi says: No.
--- Many pages of wisdom later ---
56) I have followed your sage advice. My protagonist has forgotten his original ambition and is now stricken with intense homolust for the antagonist. As per your suggestions, I have also went through many INTENSE training arcs: a new ability training arc, a training arc to prepare for a training arc, another new ability training arc, a timeskip training arc, a training arc after a training arc to control the new power gained from a previous training arc, and finally, super saiyan training on Namek.
Kishi says: *wipes tear* This is beautiful. I couldn’t have done better myself.
---A few pages of growing regret later---
72) Since that timeskip you recommended, I feel my protagonist has become severely overpowered, rendering everyone, but his lover, primitive in comparison. It seems that he has already long surpassed his original goal and achieving it now won’t amount to any sort of satisfaction. What hurts the most however, is seeing my fans clinging onto the hope that the plot would carry on, only to be repeatedly swindled with more pointless drivel. Should I bring my manga to a quick close with an epic fight against a greater evil?
Kishi mutters: Don’t be asinine. Now is the perfect time for another flashback.
[After many complaints, the book has now been renamed to “WORDS OF ADVICE FROM MASASHI KISHIMOTO: EXPERT TROLL AND MILKER OF DRIED TITS.”]",6
"
                15 years.
It's the reason I have for this to steal my heart despite its flaws. The story of a loser who changes the world. Positive symbolism is through everything, characters serving as general explanations for wrong human behaviours and the complexity of life are all stirred in a thick and massive stew of characters, affiliation, thoughts, perspectives, feelings...Naruto is a huge world with lots of stories and depth. And of course with so much time you can tell so much but this also means that the franchise targeted a few stages of teenage years to create something bigger than the story itself by adding the
                  element of time to the viewing experience. Some people will call it undeserved hype, but they also probably masturbate to stuff like Aoi Bungaku, Steins:Gate or animes that did not get a second season but oh boy was it going somewhere. 
This anime is timeless, Naruto and Miyazaki are immortal and if we would be fair enough to only grant access at an hypothetical bar in upscale London to animes that were able to obtain such status, the bar would never be short on staff.
Haku should of gotten more screen time, Jiraiya's death was needed but very dramatic, sasuke is ultimately kind of a douche, sakura should of been stronger and knowing that there is traffic on narutopedia is somewhat cool.",8
"
                Naruto...one of the most popular anime to ever be created, and one of the big players in mainstream shonen anime. Regardless of whether you love Naruto or hate it, you have to admit it did something right -- nothing can get this popular while being very bad.
Story -- 9
The story of Naruto is probably the best and worst quality of this anime. It's built around the complex world of ninjas (shinobi) that is very carefully crafted with hundreds of characters, tons of ninja abilities (jutsus), and an immersive system of countries/villages. All this creates an almost surreal realistic effect. The amount of work it takes
                  to actually become well versed in all of Naruto-dom is a lot, but anyone that watches the 400+ episodes combined between Naruto and Shippuuden will learn them. So the greatest part of this anime is that it is large, evolving, changing. But the world, can, be at times, almost TOO large. You can have one episode in the middle of Konoha (Village Hidden in the Leaves in the dub) and then suddenly jump to a location far far away, with little pretext. While that's fine and dandy, it's hard to jump from place to place and time to time. Some episodes also are happening at subsequent times with others: randomly making up numbers, but 42 and 43 could happen at the same time in the Naruto world -- just in different places. The world is great, but the method they use to show it can be jumpy and confusing at points to someone that isn't used to it.
Art -- 6
The art in Naruto isn't bad. Well, yes it is. Wait, no it's not. Wait, yes it is. And that basically sums up the art in Naruto -- it will be pristine one moment, then trash the next. I remember at one point during one of the ever-so-long filler arcs, the art quality got so bad that you could just see straight lines for people's edges, rather than the often used inventions known as curved lines. But as soon as the story came back into the main story arc, the art suddenly jumped back. I think even the studio that works on Naruto gets tired of the filler, sometimes. Overall, it would be a 7 or 8 normally, but due to the laziness of the studio in some episodes, I'm bumping it down to a 6. 
Sound -- 8
The other great thing about popular shows is that they can always have an amazing soundtrack. This is true for both Naruto the original and Shippuuden. The opening, closings, and themes of Naruto are not overly complex, but recognizable and not harsh on the ears. Some memorable themes from both series would have to include ""Blue Bird,"" ""Sadness & Sorrow,"" and ""Sengunbanba."" Though they are spread out -- most of the openings and closings aren't bad, just not memorable -- there are the occasional few that you will remember and think ""that  music paired up so well."" At one point, a very emotional instrumental piece -- Sadness & Sorrow -- was played during the funeral of one of the ninja leaders. The somber attitude, good artwork (for once! hooray!) and moody and powerful music allowed that particular episode to stay in people's minds.
Character -- 7
Character, character, character. The characters of Naruto are always evolving, changing, etc., etc. But the problem is -- is that when you have such a large world, with a couple hundred characters, the majority of them will get put on the side. So you are introduced to Awesome Character Z, who you love for maybe 10 or 20 episodes. But then they're put to the side, and they just become filler every now and then -- it's hard to include everyone. The main characters' development is nice, to say a lot. If you compare the Naruto at the start of the original series to the Naruto now, a lot has changed. Even more so if you compare it to what has happened in the manga. It basically follows his life from the 12 year old child everyone hates (you know there is one of those kids you hate in your life, don't lie!) to a respectable and caring adult (ish?) person. Of course, he's still the same old perverted, bloody-nosed kid on the inside, but the change in attitude, thinking, and manners is noticeable to say the least. Other characters -- specifically Hinata -- are thrust into a main-supporting role, with small development -- she basically has a crush on him which cripples her, and then she has to confront that and either save herself or Naruto in order to be productive, and stays like this for well, the entire series. These sort of characters (see: Temari, Gaara, Hinata, Neji, etc.) are basically only used for the advancement of the main characters (see: Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Sai, etc.).
Enjoyment -- 7
Okay. Filler. Filler. Filler. OMG Awesome episode-! No, wait, filler.
The enjoyment of Naruto is spliced up -- the fillers are generally boring and only put out to keep the massive drones that support Naruto appeased -- but I have to admit, there are some pretty awesome fight sequences and battle scenes. If you are one of the people who likes to skip over / breeze through filler, then you will get a greater enjoyment out of Naruto Shippuuden as a whole. It seems as of late like they've been stretching each of the episodes out a little more than needed (as if to give the manga an already larger head start which it doesn't need), but I'm willing to chalk that up as a decision to explain what's happening fully. At the moment, a lot of complicated drama and plots are coming together and unfolding, so the pace doesn't need to be as fast as in the manga. Regardless, counting filler, enjoyment is about a 7. Without it, it would be an 8 or 8.5; just filler would be a 4.5ish. So as a whole, it's a 7.
Overall - 7.5
TLDR:
You can't really put ""halfs"" on these reviews, so I decided to be generous and give it that extra .5. Out of the ""kings"" of shonen mainstream anime, Naruto definitely is not the worst (see: One Piece, Bleach) but not as refined as the best (see:Fullmetal Alchemist). It has very strong story and sound elements, and can have both very crappy and very well made art. The character development for main characters is fantastic -- just not so much for the static and supporting characters. The enjoyment value is high when it's following the manga and not in filler -- it is dismal when it is in filler, though. Overall, it's a decent series. Maybe not watching 400 episodes worth if you want to catch up / are starting new, but not a bad series by any means.",7
"
                        Contrary to the opinion of a big number of fans I believe that Naruto Shippuden was better than original series. The story may not have foreshadowing like One Piece or symbolism like the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter X Hunter but it is still amazing and in my opinion it has the best fights. Every big battle contains a high level of intensity, strategy and creativity and that includes the final arc which everybody criticizes without realizing that even after the power level of the characters grew, they are still using their heads.
My favourite part about the
                  story is that unlike other anime/manga from the battle Shounen category, Naruto Shippuden features the adventures of two main characters, Naruto and Sasuke, as they reach closer to the final stage they will share. Basically it's like watching two different anime at the same time. The main theme of the story is pain and how can we reach to understand each other by understanding each others pain. Besides that the arcs which show us the events from the past and how the world reached to be like this feel just like a history book, not a boring one from school, but one full of action which keeps surprising you till the end.
         Some people will most likely say that this anime is not worth watching because of the huge number of fillers which are not even as good as the ones that other big Shounen have. Even though this review is supposed to be about Shippuden I feel responsible to say that the fillers from the original series are awesome. The first anime material I have watched and what convinced me to watch anime in the first place were those fillers. Some of them were just as funny as Gintama and One Piece and it would be a waste to skip them. As for the fillers from Shippuden I must admit that they are not that great, but I still liked them because they gave some characters the screen time that they deserved. And I don' know if naming some arcs is considered spoiler (hope not), but the fillers which show us Kakashis and Itachis pasts are so well made that I consider them canon. And the filler arc about Naruto and a few other characters travelling with a boat in order to reach an island from the land of lightning(an event which is canon) was again extremly funny. And if you are that stubborn that you don't even wanna give those fillers a chance you can just skip and you will still have more than 200 episodes to watch, after all there are people who would say that even 70 episodes is too much.
         The artstyle used by Masashi Kishimoto is one of my favourites and the only part which is not perfect about it is the pretty plain hair. As for the animation, it may not be Madhouse level, but that doesn't make the anime less enjoyable. The soundtrack is also amazing being able to bring every emotion from sadness and despair to anger and excitement to its peak.
          Unfortunatly some of the main characters have not received enough development, but there are also lots of characters with such great backstories, roles, and well developed personalities that I can honestly call them some of the best characters ever created in the history of anime and manga. Even the less developed characters have matured after the timeskip and evolved without loosing their personalities. 
         In coclusion Naruto Shippuden is a great anime which I highly recommend to not only the Shounen lovers, but also to the other kinds of fans and it still remains my favourite after watching over 60 different anime from all the genres.",10
"
                Well .. so as One Piece and Bleach .. this anime is one of the most known animes around the western world.. well there are a lot of theories about it but let me notice you .. POPULARITY DOES NOT MEAN IT IS GOOD ! 
This anime started extremely well, with epic scenes and epic battles plus a nice pace on the development and a good work on exploring the main characters.. combined with a nice sound track and a fair art, it could be a 9/10 .. BUT .. it makes the same mistake as one piece .. IT'S TOO DAMN LOOOOOOOONG so it
                  gets repetitive and meaningless .. plus the action gets worst so as the pace and the character development is always the same. I mean for more than 200 eps i'm hearing this :"" I'm not alone, i have friends, so i'm strong and i won´t lose ! Oh and i want to be Hokage by the way"" .. just makes no sense .. 
Talking about this anime makes me sad because i always think how much potential was wasted here .. 
Story : 9/10 . Well i will have to talk about the first season, ""Naruto"". Here the plot was a 10/10. Just perfect. The plot is interesting, creative and original at astonishing levels and it just looks extremely great. Since the first episodes they give us some mysteries and throughout the show they will reveal them and adding another misteries related to the plot .. which make us throughout the first season of Naruto (taking out the last 2 arcs which are fillers) and the first part of Naruto Shipudden hooked to the plot because we always have something to figure out.  
BUT .. now they at the current time of the anime, they already explored everything, and the anime is just boring.. there are no secrets anymore, i already know the entire history since the beginning of the world it self ! Now we are just seeing extended crappy fights with shit talks about friendship for like 15 min of each episode .. i'm done with that ! Plus they always are showing the same thing over and over again .. why? Because they don´t have anything else to show. 
An example is like how Garen became one of the Naruto's closest friend .. i've seen that memory so many times throughout the fights which is just stupid .. the same thing happens with all of the other characters.. so every episode we have 3-4 min of crappy fights, the rest is just the characters talking to themselves the same thing over and over again.  
Plus .. the piece of art that they had was just amazing .. and they were able to blow it up to what we have now .. a silly ninja story which only focuses the importance of friends .. it's so disappointing .. For the first part of the show, we can see some maturity in the anime, which is pretty rare for a shonen. It talks about interesting themes and have some nice conversations .. now ? It looks like they copied One Piece .. It really makes me mad. The plot used to look mature, now it looks so childish.. 
The action reached ridiculous levels .. at the begining of Naruto Shippuden, some fights were beyond epic. Each fight had a ""mini twist"" when it comes to the actual power of the characters .. so when we think he is using his best skill, we get to know that he has more powerfull skills to show, which make the action so good. Plus, each character has a lot of special skills, different from each other, so we can´t never predict what he is going to do. Now ? Basically they do a contest about who can make the biggest explosion. So naruto trhowing Rasengans all over the place, and the openents doing the same thing with some kind of ""energy ball"".. how cool is that? (it really sucks)
Art: 6/10. The detail is almost none because to ""hide"" the detail they make some huge explosions and everything gets covered by dust, and the characters don´t look great. The background is also weak, so nothing here excels. 
Sound: 9/10. Every single opening is pretty damn good (check on the web and see how many openings are only for naruto shipudden), the OST are memorable ! I mean i loved the entire OST related to Akatsuki and the Bijus. Just incredible damn good. It fits nice with the action, give us a nice mood and ultimately, some epic scenes. 
Character: 8/10. Another failure .. did you ever heard about Itachi? Or Nagato? Or Madara? You probably heard about them all .. they are just astonishing characters with a excelent background story .. meanwhile .. the FUCKING 5 HOKAGES ARE THE SAME SHIT . Yes .. the same shit. ""I will protect my village"" it's basically all they have to say. Plus every other characters (like Naruto's friends) are just there to be there. They have no development at all, they are just there to fill in. And then we have characters like Sakura. Well she says ""i won´t be dependent on Naruto anymore"" like 5 times, after each times she ends up depending on him for everything. Naruto carries his village and it's the only ""OP"" character at the moment, which is a shame. In Naruto and even in the first part of shippuden, we do have some nice characters getting development and being part of some excelent fights.
Now? It's basically waiting naruto using Rasengan 1000 times and defeat the enemies.  
All the characters can be resumed with this sentence: I have friends, so i will always win. 
The villians: I'm alone, because that's how we can get true power. Friends are nothing. 
It really works like that, each character has the same motivations, if it is a villian, probably he had some dark past and now he belives he is better alone. Is it is a good guy, he belives in friends and that kind of stuff. Really there is 0 variety when it comes to characters. (of course taking out those 3 that i talked about) 
About Naruto it self .. well the typical shonen main character.. about his rival, Sasuke.. he had his highlight on Naruto and Naruto Shippuden first part .. well now it's just a pussy and no one cares about him. 
Enjoyment: 6/10. It's just boring, meaningless .. for an action anime, there is no action. That's all i have to say. 
Overall: 6/10. As you were able to see, we can divide Naruto Shippuden into 2 parts. The first part (9/10) and the second part (4/10) .. which only makes a 6/10. If the show is going to get better? Well i don´t know, hopefully it will, but i doubt .. for who likes shonens, there are betters out there, even though this anime has the best plot i've ever seen, it does not worth the 100 fillers plus the crappy low anime that is being now .. if i advise this one? Well at least the first part is great, the second one? Don´t touch it. I consider the first part everything except the fillers from the first episode of shippuden until the beggining of the 4th ninja war.",6
"
                I just want to start this review by saying that I love this series and I have my reasons, and while I will try to be as objective as possible, I am a fan (this should be known). 
Story: One of the benefits of such a long story like Naruto is that it truly feels epic. When you finish the series, you feel like you have been through it all with these characters. The story is character-driven as you see our main protagonist, Naruto, and the difficult journey that he experiences throughout his life. This series is quite a bit darker than the original and
                  very mature. This works in this series benefit as its a seriousness that is needed for many of the key moments in the show. It spans through various story arcs that will always have there fair share of intense and ""edge of your seat"" moments. I want to note that there are many times where you will find yourself freaking out due to a particular storyline or amazing moment. 
Art: This is my lowest grade as the animation can be all over the place. However when it really counts, this series knocks it out of the park with its animation. Some important episodes in the story will literally look like series of high-quality desktop wallpapers flashing in front of your face (no joke, it looks that good sometimes). The fight scenes in this show are probably among the very best anime has to offer. They are visual spectacles and fights with key villains are a whole other level of amazing. It can look slightly weird at times but nothing that will stop you from watching the show or lessen your enjoyment of what you are watching. 
Sound: The openings and endings are all incredible in their own right, with a wide span of music genres (rock songs to love songs). Some soundtracks like Konoha Peace and Experienced Many Battles will literally invigorate you with so much emotion (its crazy). I will say that not all the tracks are perfect but they do their job. 
Character: I can't even describe how good the characters are in Naruto because you just have to see for yourself. I think you can attribute this to how good the Chunin Exam arch was in the original Naruto, but in this series they are just more fleshed out and deepened. You will literally see characters that you may hate at first but end up loving a couple episodes later. The main character, Naruto, is extremely well done and you can't help but like him. The other main character, Sasuke, is equally well-written. The rivalry between the two characters is really something that this series nailed. 
Enjoyment: This review really can't do this show justice or express my love for the series as a whole. There is a reason Naruto is as popular as it is, and its because it has touched so many people around the world. While there were some bumps along the way, it was worth it. 
Overall: 10-One of the best anime created",10
"
                I started watching Naruto the wrong way. 
The first thing I knew about Naruto was his battle with Pain. Then after that, I began watching Jiraiya's fight with Nagato. Sakura and Granny Chiyo's battle with Sasori. The Third Hokage's death. And so on... I missed a lot of episode, nevertheless, I knew I should begin with the first episode not in Shippuuden but in the original Naruto itself. 
But nooo. I was so stubborn so I began to read the manga first. Ever since I heard that Naruto has ended, I was itching to read its manga for good. And I did. A week later,
                  I found myself crying and inspired. I regret not paying attention to such an amazing manga. 
STORY :
Some would say I'm exaggerating, but for me, Naruto is what I can proudly say a ""masterpiece"". I love Naruto so much it pains my kokoro. Any month now, or maybe a year, Shippuuden will end like a flash. Fillers may make this masterpiece a junk but I assure you, some fillers are worth a shot. If you hate it, then don't watch it. The pacing will still be the same. Naruto will remain the same. I may not be a super Naruto fanatic, I can't call myself that yet. Naruto may not be my childhood favorite but it is my inspiration. The heck with Naruto-more-then-a-decade fans. I, too, has Naruto inside me. 
Ninjustu. Gengutsu. Taijutsu. Senjutsu. Fuinjutsu. There are so many justu to elaborate with but that makes this anime special. Over the past decade, I hear many jutsu throughout my community. I remember how I used to play games on my friends ps3. Naruto here, Naruto there. Even now, when I attend cosplay events, Naruto is still popular. I always ask myself why. Why is Naruto so popular? Is the anime even this good? Why is Sasuke such a news word in the society? Now I know why : it's because you can never change time. You can never change hearts. You can never change memories. 
Naruto has its own place in the anime industry. As well as any other anime out there. Even if A LOT are already tired of fillers and unending battles, this anime will never waver. Who could ever forget Naruto famous ""I'll become a Hokage"" quote? I'm sure that I won't. (10/10)
CHARACTER :
Ahhh. This is what I love the most in this anime. So let's start with Naruto Uzumaki. The Nine Tails Jinchuriki. The prophecy child. Who would not love Naruto, anyway? He may be a loser, a brat, a stupid shinobi, but who would have thought that he could can the whole shinobi world? Naruto's development started when people hated him more and more as he grows up. And later did he blossom when a person finally acknowledge him. He is not just the nine tails jinchuriki. He is Naruto Uzumaki. And he will become a hokage. A man full of words is better than a man who doesn't recognize his worth. 
And there's come Sasuke. Sasuke Uchiha, the avenger (coughs). Kidding! I honestly hated Sasuke at first. Unlike Naruto, he only wants vengeance. He locks his self in his own wicked world. He wanted to become strong to kill the person who attacked his village, his parents, his everything. I know it must have been painful to witness your beloved killed also by your beloved, but putting everything aside  for vengeance? Alright, that's pretty much okay. No one could ever stop you anyway. And if it wasn't for Sasuke the avenger, things would not end up the way it is in the end. Everyone has a purpose in life. Despite of everything he did, I'd still want him back. He's home is Konohagakure after all.
And as for Sakura. Oh, I love her development. From a weak and fragile girl to a strong and powerful woman indeed. I never hated her, really. She has her own issues and I respected that. She love Sasuke (who doesn't?) so much that she was willing to do everything for him.  Love is a battle, and so she took her own path by becoming a shinobi that can stand by herself. She is a character that has an open development. Watch the anime and you'll see how she strive everything for her to be acknowledge the same way the rest of the Team 7 were.
There are many more characters to praise. Everyone changed for the better. They had their own pain, happiness, beliefs. Thank you specially for Naruto's Will of Fire for leading the shinobi world. Everything was worth it. (10/10)
ART AND SOUND :
I am not really good when it comes to analyzing the art style but from what I saw, it was an okay for me. There are some fights that I was expecting a lot of animations but thank you for the sound and effects my feels stays the same. I love how the sound can be so perfect from time to time. There are many soundtracks too that I would love to listen over and over. The background music is always fitting with the atmosphere. It makes me cry, ya know!!! I just hope the animation will be amazing in the last part of the series. (MadaraxGuy / SasukexNaruto fight pls)

I cried. I laughed. I felt the pain and the hopes of many shinobi in this anime. And I wouldn't have asked for more.  Thank you for the roller coaster ride, Naruto. Thank you for teaching me not to give up. Thank you for the comfort and love that I haven't realized all these years. And oh, thank you Kishimoto Sensei for creating Naruto. I love you so much, thank you thank you thank you!!! Words will never be enough for inspiring me to believe in myself. I will never give up. No matter how hard life may be, I'll always remember Naruto's will of never giving up. 
""And my future dream is to be the greatest Hokage! Then the whole village will stop disrespecting me and start treating me like I'm somebody. Somebody important!"" - Naruto Uzumaki
This anime is worth a shot. Try watching every episode and refrain from skipping fillers. Some of it may be very important, ya know! 
""A masterpiece will never be considered as a flawless creation nor idea. Everything and everyone has its own flaws and mistakes. Nevertheless, a masterpiece is considered to be acknowledge and not to be judge by others.""
And that is what I learned from watching this amazing anime. May others find their own inspiration in you, Naruto.",10
"
                Many people have already talked about the issues of this franchise (this show in particular). It's time to present my objective point of view about Naruto Shippuden. Let's start talking about the main problems presented in it:
1) Time skip. The show already starts with a big issue. There are characters that have obtained power ups behind the scenes, others have been rewritten in the way that Kishimoto wanted like the case of Gaara and many of them are exactly the same, only now taller than before. This is one of the worst way to use a time skip, there's no real justification in first instance.
2)
                  Nearly everyone in this show are retarded. Naruto for trying to rescue throughout the damn show a character more retarded and edgy than him, that literally wanted to kill him every time that he went in his rescue, Sasuke for being an edgelord that contradicts everything, since the message his brother left him about why he became a villain to his own principles and motivations that never been explained why it have changed drastically. Additionally, thanks to the previous issue, the character transformed in a plot device. Sakura for being an absolute useless character that only exist for the ships and forced romances, Hinata and similars for being a cheap fanservice and a plot device in the form of damsels in distress, Obito for beginning a war only because he wanted to live in a sexual fantasy with his dead waifu (this is one of the most retarded characters) and many other cases.
3) Many characters were a replica from the previous Naruto. For example Sasori that have a very similar story to Gaara and Kakashi and Obito that were a replica from the seven team.
4) The ""deaths"" in this show. The death is treated in the same way that the Dragon Balls. There's no tension because there are several jutsus that can bring back to life to any character. The reason of why some of them are not revived is because Kishimoto didn't feel like doing it. And this is not the worst part, many of these characters literally revived to do nothing or to be cannon fodder for the following antagonists.
5) Many of the new characters introduced were irrelevant. Like Sai, who is only remembered for the shipping wars, the new Sasuke's ball lickers, sorry, the new Sasuke's gang that are plot devices created to save Sasuke when he was in trouble and many villains that were one-dimensional.
6) The power ups. If you transplant a special eye you will automatically get a shit of powers like the case of Kakashi and, later, Sasuke. Also, many characters obtains power ups because the script needs them to have them to beat the villain on duty as is the case with Naruto several times.
7) Plot holes. There are many of them and they are all just as retarded. For example, they literally revived an immortal character. Tell me if this is not very retarded. Following the previous point, other example is Orochimaru, if you only need to steal an Uchiha's sharingan eye to obtain his powers, his entire plan in the previous season was a waste of time. Itachi, because he turned evil to avoid a ninja war that was inevitable anyway. There are other cases, but I believe that this is enough.
8) Contradictions. The franchise began with Naruto being a loser and later it was revealed that he is literally the son of the messiah in the universe of the series. One of the messages of the show is about pacifism, which is contradicted when Naruto only forgives one of the main villains becuase he revived his friends. If there was no way to revive the characters in this series, would he have forgiven him? Sasuke, that were during big part of the show an antagonist turns into a saint for being another son of messiah, and he is forgiven for his misdeeds for people in Konoha for this reason. Both of them had the plot armor of a prophecy that made them super special, if the previous point wasn't enough.
9) Bad animation. There are a lot of memes for this reason. Well, being realistic, the previous show had the same issue.
There are also a few good points in this trashy anime:
1) Shikamaru for being one of the few characters that had interesting fights and a decent development.
2) Jiraiya, for have a significant development and a direct and indirect importance in the show.
3) Good soundtrack.
In conclusion, this was a terrible sequence that literally destroyed everything made by the first Naruto. Kishimoto should have avoided turning his franchise into a cashgrab that is not even well remembered today by his own and/or ex fans.",2
"
                The number one knucklehead ninja is...still here! His training seemed to get him no where maturity wise or skill wise. He has used the same jutsu, the same yelling tactics to throw his enemy off(?) And the same &quot;I'm hokage&quot;, &quot;I'll save you!&quot;, or &quot;My childhood sucked!&quot; Lines. He hasn't grown or learned a thing. I would think he would stop endangering his team, being disrespectful to his senior officers, and trying to solo things rather than listening to the plans. When they were younger it was acceptable, it was even funny at times, but not now. Any scene with naruto I skip immediately. It
                  is either screaming, crying, or &quot;kage bunshin no jutsu&quot;. 
Sakura and others are shown to have grown and learned many things through their training. Sakura has become way cooler than she ever was in Naruto, as well as tenten and others using newer styles of fighting from Naruto. I guess we will never see a change in the main character. I really did enjoy Naruto, but maybe I expected too much from Shippuden, or to much of a change maybe? Either way, I feel like now that they are older and with the main character still acting like this, makes the whole shinobi thing, along with all of the danger and life-threatening fighting look like a complete joke to the theme. As well as they are afraid of killing people off in my opinion, having them win against people who are said to be the greatest in the world. Making the characters older really did nothing, it is meant for the same audience that watched Naruto, and who didn't want any change or development.
The story is pretty good though, I enjoy learning about the plot development as it goes by and want to see more about Akatsuki's plans. The story with sasuke and orochimaru is good also, as I feel it will all be tied together at some point in the anime and we should see some good fight scenes (I hope).
That's about it, it's not that I hate it, but I was severely disappointed by it in a lot of ways.",7

                 Plot:
Naruto Shippuuden is the continuation of the original animated TV series Naruto.The story revolves around an older and slightly more matured Uzumaki Naruto and his quest to save his friend Uchiha Sasuke from the grips of the snake-like Shinobi, Orochimaru. After 2 and a half years Naruto finally returns to his village of Konoha, and sets about putting his ambitions to work, though it will not be easy, as He has amassed a few (more dangerous) enemies, in the likes of the shinobi organization; Akatsuki.
Naruto is an extremely popular Anime in Japan and even across the world.. The setting and the characters of this
                  anime will make you want to live in this world.. The story is good but not unique, the art look is outstanding, so overall I'll rank it 9/10..",9
"
                It's been nearly 4 years since I reviewed the original Naruto and nearly 8 since I finished watching the Japanese dub. Being bored of recent anime seasons I decided to watch Shippuden. Gosh... 3 months later and 400+ episodes finished and here I am.
I'm old now but not quite old enough to be jaded on things I used to love. I still love and enjoy the original Naruto and series like Naruto. It's a light hearted, filled with emotion show that just pulls all the right strings. It's a show that I can rewatch random episodes and still feel the same way as if I
                  was watching it for the first time. Naruto ended on good terms, the turn of Sasuke seemed like a natural progression which was foreshadowed since the beginning. A classic betrayal that didnt need a 500+ episodes. Well.. that's what I thought heading into Shippuuden and boy I was wrong.
There was so much more story that needed to be told. While the first half I commented on the strength of the side characters.  Shippuuden is about Naruto, when he is absent the show drags. And it drags quite a bit with filler and some boring arcs. But if you go pass the fillers (which have improved somewhat with some really good moments) you get just pure shounen goodness. 
I'm updating this review to reflect the entirety of Shippuuden. The show is massive there's some good aspects some pretty bad and downright terrible moments. The ninja war arc was overblown and must have been terrible to watch week in. Together it kind of works but barely. What saves the show is Naruto himself. 
What started as an annoying titular character becomes Naruto the hokage during shippuuden. It's hard to stay with a series for 10+ yrs and almost 1K episodes. So hard in fact if you did end up finishing both series you're pretty much automatically a fanboy/girl. I can see why the fandom died down in favor of shorter with a more 'impact per episode' quotient. However watching Naruto grow up over that long period makes it feel more significant. In that way it surpasses it's contemporaries plus the new upstarts.",9
"
                For all those complaining about the fillers.....If you truly love Naruto, Enjoy the ride while it lasts. And I have to say, this anime was what got me into other anime.The overall opening's and ending's of Naruto was excellent.....along with it's various other soundtracks that make sure to hit you right in the feels. The many character's in the story also add to the excitement of the story and each character's various back story's are well potrayed and conveyed as the stroy continues.
And well i personally love this anime because this anime really did teach me a lot, from when i was very young and
                  it still continues to do a fine job at it.",10
"
                The anime is amazing. Actually Shippuden is better than the original Naruto series. The original Naruto was way too immature with Naruto acting too much Shit and 100% determination with no brains whatsoever(I dont konw how the plan to beat Neji came to his mind alongside Kiba), but in Shippuden, the Naruto was much more mature, rational, logical and everything he did made sense.The most epic part being his promise to free the world from the curse of hatred.(Not his hokage dream or Sasuke revival).
The only thing that hampers its productive abilities is the amount of fillers and flashbacks. But believe me; skip through them
                  and you will find Shippuden the most beautifully pesented anime ever.
Story: Well the strory has grown more complex than the original Naruto.  The plot seems to join all the stones ever in the ninja world history to be unturned. But Shippuden has a weakness which Naruto dosent have; thats character depth of some people.ROCK LEE turns out from something into nothing.The overall background strorytelling of the character's had again lived up to its reputation.10/10 for strory.
Sound: Naruto dosent really have the fighting OSTs which gap is filled by Attack On Titan, but the soundtracks which Shippuden presents is sad, emotional, beautiful and soothing. The "" Sage of six paths death theme"" and ""The guts to never give up"", being my favourites. But the first spot is STILL held by ""Wind"" from Naruto.10/10 for sound.
Characters: The characters have grown incredibly powerful with some people coming into action like the hokages, Madara, Obito. The series also has my favourite villain- PAIN and my fav characetrs of course- NARUTO and ITACHI .10/10 for characetrs. 
Now, I reacommend that please people skip through the fillers and dont spred any rot about this epic. 10/10 for overall presention.(ignoring the fillers).",10
"
                A series that has filler, emotions and one of the best intros and outros for the otakus and enthusiasts.
Naruto is a series which has romance, beautifully executed fight scenes and interesting plot developments.
If you have already watched the OG Naruto - you will realise that this has more character development for characters such as Hinata Hyuuga , Neji Hyuuga, Shikamaru Nara and more than ever - Sasuke Uchiha!
The scientific logic in shonen series was never relatable, but the fight scenes make it worth a shot in any scenario - such as the fight between Naruto v/s Pain, Guy v/s Madara, Obito v/s Naruto and Sasuke,
                  Naruto v/s Sasuke and many more.",10
"
                Naruto has given me many LIFE LESSONS that i honestly didn't recognize until i watched the show. Naruto has given me inspiration in everything that i do. I know this may sound absurd but Naruto somehow made me a BETTER PERSON!
Stories of love, fear, bonds, hopes, and dreams, gave Naruto a deeper meaning than just brawl and comedy. It serves an inspiration to me in real life.
Naruto brings revolution in people!! Its addiction!!Its faith!! It gives you the strength to believe in yourself!! Even if you’re broke, or faced a break up with your girlfriend, sad, shattered whatever...and even if you don't watch Naruto that
                  day...but thinking about it... i don’t know why, but it will make you smile and give you strength!! Naruto is all about determining the way one should treat people after going through everything possible in the name of sorrow and grief in life!! In anime, Naruto Shippuden is god!!!
TRUE FANS know the virtue of Naruto!! It’s a feeling, call it an experience which is found in the words used aren't just put to explain the moment and thoughts of the people in it... But it has a meaning in the future!! Every time you watch an episode of it again and again, the interpretation is different!!! I know my comment is weird, and my way of explaining its importance seems to be significantly stupid.. but TRUE FANS...you agree with me right?",10
"
                Best freaking show of all time hands down, no cap. This show changed my life in every way not even joking it has a perfect story full of development and amazing characters. I would highly highly highly recommend this show for many reasons. It taught me more about love, life and faith than anything else. I cannot say enough good about this show. Watch it and stick with it until the end the reward is insane even though it is long it is so worth it. Words don’t do it justice I love it so much. This show is filled with memorable moments and characters
                  that will give you chills and make you a better person at the end. The soundtrack is unbelievably good and will, stick with you forever. This show cuts deep and makes you cry laugh and everything in between. This may seem like a fluffy all good review but that’s because it is a perfect show I am not overdoing my love for this show.",10

                     Review for both Shippuden and the Original Naruto.
      Naruto is... a journey.
      I remember back in my earlier years of school watching the show late at night was kind of ritualistic for me (together with Shaman King). Now, me being a year away from graduating high school and the show airing for 14 years coming to a close earlier this year, I decided to watch the last 100 or so episodes after taking a long break from anime to put and end to a part of my childhood. Man, did
                  I miss out.
      The anime itself, through time, grew and changed, just like everyone that watched it since the beginning. It started off as a silly-headed shounen about ninjas and super powers and ended with the main characters aiming to save the world from devastation.
      Story-wise, Naruto goes through hardships, endures pain, learns from his mistakes and tests his strength against many foes, but ultimately the final showdown is between him and his first rival, which proves that the show didn't lose focus throughout the years and finished on the note that Kishimoto wanted to (brilliant on his part).
  While the artstyle is unique and easily-recognizable even for non-anime viewers, quality really drops at time, most evident in the filler episodes, which I'll talk about later on.
  Music is really well put all-around, it makes you pumped when there's an action scene coming up, makes you emotional when something sad happens and makes you literally laugh out loud when needed.
      Something that strikes me as surprising is how well-developed is the supporting staff. Most of them are filled with personality and distinguishable, likable design. For every arc focused on Naruto, there are a couple focused on his friends that help him through his path, which leads me to my next point.
 Naruto's motto, ninja way or nindō or whatever you want to call it, is that of never running away or going back on his word, which really speaks about the show itself and the lesson it wants to teach.  As the already mentioned hardships suggest, Naruto never altered his vision or casted aside someone else's feeling or dreams, showing that there is always a reason to try your hardest and be righteous.
     Not everything is without its mistakes, though. The only gut-wrenching flaw about the series is how. many. god. damn. filler. episodes. there. are. They make up about half of the episodes, while most of the provide little to no content. To cut some slack off, some of the arcs are pretty amusing by themselves and deserve a watch.
      Overall, the anime is great, it certainly has a special place in my heart, even if I won't revisit it sheerly because of volume. As undoubtedly one of the most memorable long-running anime out there, it surely is  a thing to relish if not for the entertainment it brings, but for the millions of people that it inspired, just like dragon ball did to the previous generation. Now the baton is passed to his son, Boruto, and only time will tell if he'll make his dad proud.",9
"
                Firstly, I have read the entirety of the Naruto manga and am up to date with the Shippuuden anime series, but I will try and make this review as SPOILER FREE as possible, as long as you have seen the original Naruto series.
I will not be mentioning ""filler"" content in this review, everything will be related to the canon manga.
So Naruto: Shippuuden starts off 2 years after the events of Naruto. They're all a little bit older now, and a hell of a lot stronger now. The spoiler free story for those who have finished the original series, is pretty much Naruto training hard with
                  his two goals, one of becoming the Hokage, and the other is bringing Sasuke back to the village.
Story 10/10:
For someone who has read the entirety of the manga and seen everything so far of the anime, I must say it is an amazing story the entire way through Shippuuden with no plot holes and everything fitting in perfectly. This show is full of twists and turns, some that you might expect and other's that will just blow you out of nowhere. Trying to keep this as spoiler free as possible, the story follows Naruto as he gets stronger and stronger, unlocking new Jutsu's and powers throughout as he tries to achieve his one true goal of becoming Hokage. However you are solely mistaken if you think the story of Shippuuden is nothing but the character Naruto, as Naruto is only one of the three main characters and the story follows the other two just as much and also goes very in depth with a lot of the support characters too. They all play their own major role in the different events that happen in the story. Would be really hard to say much more about the story without spoiling anything, so ill end it there.
Art 10/10:
As an art and animation student at a university, this art is definitely my most favourite type of art that any anime can ever have. Its very defined, very simplistic and also looks very realistic and amazing. With just a few lines and curves making up a characters face, every one of them is different yet they are all still so simple which makes it the best art to have. I've always said to myself if I were to create my own art style, I would heavily reference the art style of Naruto. Every different emotion is defined perfectly on every character without having to go over the top and greatly exaggerating the persons face, like some other anime's do.
Character 10/10:
The character's is probably the main reason I really love watching these long running shounen anime's, and more specific, Naruto Shippuuden. I have seen the entirety of whats out of One Piece, Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter and Fairy Tail and Naruto: Shippuuden has the best or second best characters of all of them. Every character has a different personality and a different skill set and almost every character in the series at one point in the show has a back story or a ""flashback"" to tell you more about them, which is exactly what you want when you find a character who you favourite in a show and want to know more about them. Trying to create my favourite character list without filling half of it with Naruto characters was a serious challenge.
Enjoyment 10/10:
I enjoyed this series so much, that It took me just over two months to watch the very first episode of the original Naruto series, to episode 468 of the Naruto Shippuuden series, and also to read the rest of the manga until the end, and... to watch Naruto: The Last, Boruto: Naruto The Movie and get up to date with the Boruto manga, but they're all topics of a different day. I even enjoyed most of the filler episodes, although some of them got boring, I wanted to watch them anyway because I simply just wanted to watch more of Naruto because of how much I love this show.
I'm gonna end this review with saying that Naruto: Shippuuden is 2nd on my favourite list out of over 150 anime's and that it is a must watch for those who have seen the original Naruto series. If you're here without watching the original series, then what are you doing! Hurry up and watch the original series!",10
"
                Peace to all.
I don't want to be considered as the hater here about Naruto Shippuden. Don't get me wrong. I have watched the complete manga and also ""Naruto Anime"" complete and I have found them both very pleasant; great series with a excelent history and a whole new world, with the exception of the last episodes. 
Let me make it very clear. This review is about Naruto Shippuden, the anime, not the manga of Naruto or the anime Naruto, which are great.
Story 7 of 10:
First of all, I would like to say that NS is pretty much overrated. The main spine of the story is
                  very good, but is (most of the times) very predictible. Basing on the motivation and purpose of the main chatacter we could say that it's monotonous and ever sometimes annoying. The anime is full of pointless filler plots that the team of production use to gain some time, making the story a total mess. 
Art 7 of 10: 
Not much to say about it. In this part I have to explain that I was very disappointed with the animation and art of this anime. Having watched Naruto, you'll know that I mean. Some fights were just poorly made and sometimes it even gives the impression of being made by some kind of fanart (without stealing credit to the great FanArts that are out there.)
Sound 8 of 10:
The sound is in fact very good. Almost all the main songs (Ending or opening) are well made and kept a good relation with the serie. The soundtrack is fun and unique, not being able to compare to any other thing.
Character 8 of 10:
Here you have a good variety. Everyone has it's own history. You'll surely find one that you will be identified with. The characters are marked by families and a sort of abilities so it's very easy to found a favorite and embrace it. Here, I have to make the exception of the fill stories, whose characters are just useless. Totally useless.
Finaly in Enjoyment and Overall it's a solid 7 of 10:
You can definetly have some fun and exceiment watching this anime, especialy if you saw Naruto (If you havent dont watch this one, xD), buuuut (and it's a big ""but"") the animation and plot takes a lot of the enjoyment of the series, so badly sometimes that it's even  harmfull to your eyes. If you dont believe me, search ""Pain's fight"" in youtube. Just saying.",7
"
                My Thoughts on the Ending of Naruto
First thing first. I will miss Naruto like no other. I first came into contact with Naruto way back in the 7th grade of middle school when it used to air in English on Toonami. It was love at first sight. The date was September 10th, 2005. I eagerly awaited each week for new episodes, and Naruto never disappointed, even on its worst episode. Fast forward 9 years later, and I'm still eagerly awaiting each new episode every week, even though I have already finished the events of the manga. Critics of Naruto say that the anime/ manga has
                  gone on for way too long and that it should have ended earlier; it's no longer good. I can't deny that Naruto has a ton of plot holes, but even so, the author has given me something to consistently look forward to for 9 years. How many anime series can you say have done something like that for you? 
Moreover, my interest in Naruto is not solely tied to the plot. To this day, I've bought 12 Naruto games and counting. I love the Naruto universe. I love the characters. I love the powers. I love the action. I love the voice actors. All of the Naruto games I own do an amazing job at recreating the characters from the series and letting you feel as though you are the character. When I choose Sasuke in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, I feel like I become Sasuke. All of his powers from the show, I can command at the tips of my fingers. I'm the one using the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu, and I'm the one unleashing Susanoo. As a result, the joy I get from being my favorite characters in these games heightens the amount of pleasure I take away from the series itself. 
It's been a couple weeks since Naruto ended, and it's still hard to believe it's over. When I read the final chapter, I honestly didn't want to turn the pages. Seeing all of the characters that started off at 12 years old become adults, get married, and have kids, really got believing that it is in fact over--the end of a generation. I was 12 years old myself when I began watching Naruto, now I'm 21. In a way, I feel as though I've grown up with these characters and that my youth is also approaching it's end soon. In the coming years, I'm not sure if I will ever experience an anime that has done what Naruto has done for me ever again. I'm really sad that my journey with Naruto is rapidly approaching it's end, but I'm also thankful for these past 9 years. Arigatou gozaimasu, Masashi Kishimoto.",7

                First off i wanna say this show deserves more credit where credit is due
also Shippuden is ten times the show part 1 was
Naruto's development was truly amazing to watch
the ignorant kid tht only cared about wht he wanted started learning how the ninja world works and thru this he gains the respects of others by proving himself time and time again.. finally understanding hatred and how he could change the world
and then Sasuke's development and character was truly amazing the way how he gained power in his eyes and thru each transformation he gained a larger goal and saw the world differently
Truly a great story
                  about basic human understanding and world peace
there's plenty of characters tht i could talk about tht had great development but tht would take such a long time lmao
Just the fact tht Naruto grew so much makes him T3 MC of all time and its a shame not a lot of ppl apperciate the greatness behind this anime and story
Everyone should watch Naruto tbh truly a great show

                Naruto Shippuden. This show is both loved and demised. I personally like the series, it's good and nice to watch, nothing overly amazing and not that much overly crap shoot stuff I hate. (OH WAIT)
Story: 7
The story in Shippuden is nice, all wrapped up with a bow. At times it is serious and somewhat thrilling to watch, and other times you're blowing bubbles in your chocolate milk as people talk about stuff for over a minute. The overall plot in the story stays the same almost the entire way through, Naruto wants to ""save"" Sasuke, somehow stop Akatsuki, and be recognized by the village. The
                  last one happens after Pain is defeated, and none of the other ones have happened so far so, more sludging through. (WEEEE)
Art: 6
The animation changes so much throughout this series, in such varying degrees and yes, I know that the studio has a budget, but when you use the same flashback over five times, barely even ****ing shade anything, keep characters frozen still while they're talking, and try to pass off people staring at each other for a FULL MINUTE as part of the show, you start to wonder how Studio Pierrot is even doing. But the show does have nice, fantastic animation. It's just not as frequent. Also, some of the best animation and shading I've seen in this show have been during fights and the OPs and EDs, and some other places throughout.
Sound: 7
This is a another reason why people hate Shippuden. I'm not talking about the voice actors, they're great, I'm talking about the music. Sure, there are nice tracks throughout the series, some are beautiful, others I could somewhat jam to. But when I think that you've played that same stupid ""OMG SUSPENSE SH*T IS HAPPENING"" track for the hundredth time, I feel like face-desking. So many tracks are overly repeated to the point where you feel like you could play them if someone gave you the instrument they were playing the music with somewhat mediocrity. I'm also including OPs and EDs. A lot of the openings and endings sound great, like ""Cascade"" and ""FLAME"" Others sound, well, annoying, overly produced, and bleh. BLEH. Like the sh*tfest which is ""Totsugeki Rock"". Just, ewwww.
Characters: 7
The characters in this show are nice. Sure, some of them are kinda tropey, but most them have something unique. Naruto seems to go through lots of pressure, CAUSE GUESS WHAT? OP PEOPLE WANNA MURDER YA! So he gets to experience and grow through that. Sakura is still romanticizing with hopes of being with Sasuke, and I can be harsh here, but I can't. I'm a hopeless romantic too. *sigh* She is tough though, and doesn't take no sh*t. Sai is shown to have had a bond with a person who was like a brother to him, and they then had to fight to the death, (**** you Danzou) and it had feels. Sasuke is a stupid hormone controlled idiot who wants to destroy the thing his brother protected, and ""build a new nation"". Can I call him stupid again?The other characters are fine, but a lot of them you couldn't really feel for since you didn't know that much about them.

FILLER. FILLER. FFFFFIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. I""M HERE WANTING TO SEE A NEW EPISODE OF CANON, I SAY, CANON SHIPPUDEN, AND PIERROT THROWS A ****ING FILLER EPISODE OUT. AND IT""S AT SUCH UNNECESSARY MOMENTS TOO, LIKE A BATTLE JUST ENDED, EMOTIONAL SH*T HAPPENED, AND YOU THEN GET FILLER, YOU THEN FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TWO TO THREE WEEKS AGO, AND YOU DON'T GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HAVE TO REMIND YOURSELF WHAT THE **** HAPPENED, OR YOU JUST FORGET ENTIRELY IF THE FILLER RUNS FOR EIGHTY YEARS. AND SOMETIMES THE FILLER SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO THE MAIN STORY AND IT'S BULLSH*T. THE PEOPLE THAT CAN JUST BINGE THIS SHOW AND SKIP FILLERS I WISH I COULD PUNCH. *heavy breathing* The fights are nice as well, like GAI V MADARA. IT WASN'T WORTH THE WAIT, BUT IT WAS STILL AWESOME.
Overall: 7
Shippuden is an average anime. It's ruined by filler that isn't even interesting or good in the first place, constant reused flashbacks that taint the whole entire series, and the animation at times can be atrocious. (See Pain V Naruto, or ALL THE STILL SHOTS EVER SEEN) The fights can be fun, emotional, or awesome. The main story is nice, but falters at times. The sound can be the most annoying thing of the show at times, but can also be charming or pleasant. This show has over 400 episodes. If you are a person who likes 13 episode anime, then this series is going to be tough on you. If you don't like shonen, then stay away. If you're expecting romance, there ain't a lot of it, I gotta tell ya. There's only around four major moments out of over 400 episodes. If you want awesome action stuff, then this show may fit to your tastes.",7

                Naruto returns completely different, yet unchanged; yaoi fangirls, filler, and cliche friendship speeches still ruin it for the most part.
Shippuuden and the original naruto are by far the most overrated anime since Gundam Wing. I read the manga up to where it is now, and I can see how it got there, but how the anime maintains fans still amazes me. The fans are classified as ""Narutards"" to the public, due to its overwhelming popularity.
They provide 20 or 40 episodes of filler after 20 slow plot episodes, and it's just not funny at this point. I already stopped watching it an entirely moved back to
                  the manga. The manga still manages to keep me interested, but the anime is dead to me. I loved shippuuden until the filler started getting ridiculous. I don't know what those guys in the anime industry are doing, but it's screwed up how they love to send their ratings plummeting into the ground so often. 
Originally, Shippuuden was an anime that had everything; tons of suspense, meaningful death scenes, and touching moments, but now it's just another anime about some grown man that acts like a kid chasing after a homicidal maniac that used to be a ""Friend"" of his.
Do I need to say anything else to get the point across that shipuuden is only good for so long?",7

                Naruto shippuden...This anime is one of best examples of manga turned into anime, The story is lengthy and long but, As we see the episodes the viewer gets absorbed in it.The character design are good.The special powers known as 'Jutsu' are more then awesome.There are several arcs in this series and the MC of story, I more like teenagers of today BOLD, KIND, SMART.
Things I like most in this series are-
1. The Storyline
2. Humour touch
3.The relationships between the characters. 
4.The Jutsu
5.The MC attitude
6 . Individual and important role of each character.
Basically it is a great story of friendship, love, and power.",9
"
                This show is really intense and if you like a good comedy and action, I highly recommend Naruto Shippuden(Of course you must watch the original.) 
     Naruto is a great show with a really deep meaning in it. Such as you are never alone, trust your comrades, and don't go down the dark path. Naruto shows many of these lessons through battles and story. (Watch to find out!)
     Another great thing Naruto does is that it is a really brings emotion to the watcher. To me, what I think every anime must have is emotion. Naruto does
                  a lot of that, especially Shippuden. With characters dying and tragic story, it 'ought to make you roll a tear down. With funny puns and great comedy, it has to make you laugh. With this emotional content, it makes it a great anime!
     Battles are also something I need to add. With episodes of battle scenes and fighting. With this non stop action, you can't quit. Epic battle scenes that make you say ""WOW!"" Battle scenes with POW! The story makes hang in there until you know.
     One last thing is the story development. What you think happens does not actually happen. So many twist and turns. A story with new things at every corner. You can't predict the ending. Characters that create plot twists, keeps you guessing to the very end.
      So for everyone reading this, I want to let you know that if you are not watching Naruto or Naruto Shippuden, you don't know what your missing.",9

                One of the most mind blowing i have ever seen. just ... just think about fantastic and fabulous and that is how you can describe naruto shippuden its fantaboulolous i assure you will love this anime it will make you cry even if your heart is made up of stone, no offense of course but seriously it is one of the big three you just have to watch it if you haven't you can not really call yourself an anime fan. Ok so lets start with the story i rate it 10/10 and i assure you that you will too but first if you are
                  just surfing around and looking for a new anime watch naruto first and then shippuden.
and now the character this isn't those types of anime that you will get hooked to after all the character development and stuff if you have already watched naruto you will get hooked to it first hand 
Ok so overall you will love this anime even if you think you have watched ever you will still love it or if your still searching for your favorite you will most likely fall in love with this 
if you want to learn about the og naruto i am going to write a review for that tomorrow most likely so you can check that out too",10
"
                A good anime, like any piece of art, isn't judged only by it's art style, characters and story. It also heavily relies on the production, fan base and various other factors.
While this anime started out well enough it had completely degraded itself with almost 45% of the episodes being fillers. As a fan I get totally engrossed in the plot and when the production decides to milk the fans for more views this becomes a stab in the back of dedicated viewers.
For 10 years I've watched this anime and at long last after all said and done all I can say about Naruto (and derivatives)
                  is that it is garbage.
Never waste your life on this show. You are too good of a human to be marred by this disdainful time sink.",3
"
                Probably one of my favorite anime of all time. This anime is a really popular anime and even though there are a lot of fillers, I really enjoy it. The sad stories in Naruto always make me cry and there are lots of hilarious moments. In addition, this is one of the few anime where the English dub does not tick me off.  
As viewers we are able to see Naruto's growth as a character from an immature brat to someone who can truly understand the pains of mankind. The only downside for me about this anime is how long you must wait for
                  the episodes to come out. I've been watching Naruto since I was in 6th grade and its been 10 years.",10

"
                SPOILER-FREE- No taking about specific characters OR specific events.
CHARACTERS:  The best part of the show is the diverse interesting set of characters.   I would argue that I love them more than the main character in many ways.  Everyone has interesting traits and each characters grows and changes during the series.  The Japanese voices are the best in terms of how they are acted. However later in the series it gets to the point where there are too many to keep track of so I made a link to 2 character maps for you for later in the series.  
STORY:
                   This is a story about more than ninjas.  It is about community, fighting for your dreams, overcoming prejudice, learning from the regrets of the past, learning to overcome hatred and fighting for a better future for all.  It gets convoluted and difficult to keep track of every character at times.  Every character is developed as the series goes on and has a back story that makes you understand even the worst characters.  The tone of the show ranges from fun & childish to dark.  It all does comes together nicely and is well rounded by the different tones.  
On the downside, there are too many flashbacks that represent more of an emotional state rather than ones that give context to the story so I can forgive those.  The Filler is also beyond bad; however I enjoyed the filler during the great ninja war.  Because of excess of characters it is too easy to become lost and that becomes even worst during the filler episodes.  
GRAPHICS/SOUNDS:  It is not important to me (I am a story/character person) so it is best to go to other reviewers.  I mean I love the theme and how it fits.  I love the animation and the sound track… even after 400+ episodes I never started to hate it.  
VOICE ACTING:  Watch the sub version ONLY.  Never watch the English version because the translation and voice acting is terrible. “Believe it” and believe me. 
THE BEST PART:   I feel like this is a piece of art that makes my soul grow/glow warm.  I really care about these characters and the story makes me think about life.  This is a series all about growing up and the change it brings.  
WARNING:  You have to watch the original Naruto Series First.  I HIGHLY suggest you only watch the sub version.  The English actors are the worst of the worst.  It is so poorly translated that it will make you HATE this anime.  Also Skip every, and I MEAN EVERY, filler series.  As much of a fan I am I HATE the filler and they are not important to the main story. 
SKIP THE FILLER EPISODES WHICH ARE: 57-70, 90-111, 144-151, 170 & 171, 223-242, 258-260, 279-281, 284-295, 303-320, 347-361, 376-377, 389-390, 391-393, 394 – 413, 416 – 417, 419, 422-423, 427-I WILL UPDATE.
  I am the type of person that likes to see everything so when I tell you to skip it, you know you can trust me when I say it is stupid, bad, and full of contradictions/plot holes.  I HATE the filler.  My rating of the show with the filler is like a 6.5.  Do not watch it… just do NOT do that to yourself.  I personally found enjoyment in watching the fillers in the great ninja war but the problem is you get lost because you forget characters and get lost.   I will fill in the fillers I liked later.  
OVERALL IMPRESSION:  This is one of the best amines I have ever seen.  Seriously skip the filler and watch the SUB version only.

                So now that the manga has ended its serialization and the anime still continues to spew endless filler for no reason other than to milk as much money as possible, I am writing a review to explain to you why Naruto: Shippuden was a promising anime that went downhill since the first episode.
The story of Naruto is an interesting and unique one. Its something that hasn't been told too often and it has a great setting. But the anime does a very poor job of executing it. There are a few canon episodes, then a plethora of fillers appear out of nowhere, so that when
                  the canon story continues from where it left off, I have somewhat lost my hype on what was happening before the filler. This is even more prominent towards the end of the series, which is where there's supposed to be excitement above all else. The fillers themselves are so bad they ruin the characters' personalities to some extent.The canon episodes are dragged on by the same flashbacks so many times you'll start feeling sleepy. The characters' backstories, especially Naruto's, are shown so many times, you won't even feel sentimental anymore. There were some great story arcs like the Pain arc, but the rest all drag on and on.
Speaking of characters, Naruto has some of the best characters in anime, hands down. Protagonists like Naruto, Shikamaru, Kiba etc and antagonists like Itachi, Nagato, Madara are some of the best ever in anime history. But I feel that as the series progresses, the series starts focusing too much on Naruto and Sasuke and leaves out interesting supporting characters. Even the notoriously bad guys are somehow turned into good guys through some bullshit backstory so that they MUST turn good before they die, even evil-F*CKING-Madara. so the series kinda ruins the characters it brought up, though I wouldn't say they are bad.
The animation too goes downhill since the beginning, and this is one of the worst aspects of the show. Too many still images, too many flashbacks, too long recaps are all there to increase the runtimes and save up some budget. There were some arcs that were decently animated, but others are sloppy and still to the point I sometimes thought my computer froze.
The soundtrack has a great Ninja-esque felling to it, and it unique and in most instances, pretty catchy. Most of the opening songs are great while the endings are average (I guess). The voice acting is done greatly, as one would expect of anime (lol). The dub, of course, is terrible.WATCH THE CAPTIONS!!!!!
Overall, Naruto is good if you ignore the plethora of fillers, the sloppy animation and the terrible dragging on of its episodes, but that just can't be ignore can they?",5
"
                Naruto shippuden or called filleruto, was great at the start, then fillers ruined it like crazzy!!! the arc now has been going on since 2013, and the latest 20 episodes have all been fillers, i dont understand whats going on? oh well, shippuden takes place 3 years after the first naruto anime, everyone you saw in the original anime has grown up, the characters in the start are really not that great, exept the main enemy group, later characters become better but are still one dimentional, like the animation, shippuden it feels like have gone threw so many diffrent animations, sometimes it looks good, sometimes
                  awfull, right now its fair, one fight scene with naruto and a main enemy has the aboslute worst animation i have ever seen in an anime, i mean wtf. Sound is really good tho and it has great intros and outros, naruto tho is the most typical shounen there is so dont expect, one punch man animation or , death note storytelling! The characters that are good are really good! like itachi uchia, sasuke uchia, naruto altho he can be annyoing sometimes, and the enemys in the hole show are some of the best ive seen in an shounene anime, overall 9/10 without fillers, but now its filleruto so 7/10",7

                A fantastic sequel to naruto with more in dept story with the characters and  action adventure surpasses the previous. The characters show more knowledge and maturity. Its a AWESOME ANIME TO WATCH.

"
                GOAT of tv in my opinion. The Naruto franchise was what introduced me into anime so I am very biased but I truly believe that most people that have seen this will agree with me.
STORY: 10/10 The pain arc, 4th war arc, and post 4th war arc are the best arcs in history in my opinion. This show made me get off my seat because I was so hyped and it has also made me cry at times. Truly a masterpiece of a story
ART: 10/10 The art style changed all of the time so its hard to rate, but for the most part it is
                  fantastic. 
SOUND: 10/10 This soundtrack is so good, i have it in my playlists. GOATED soundtrack
CHARACTER: Every character could be argued to be the best (minus Tenten). Every character is unique and awesome in their own way.
ENJOYMENT: 10/10 favorite of all time
OVERALL: 10/10 Greatest anime of all time, loved it, perfect.",10
"
                I see alot of people give this show bad or decent reviews. I honestly have no idea why people don`t like this anime. The biggest problem people seem to have with this is the amount of filler that is in it, which obviously is a problem. But almost all of the anime that are long like this have alot of filler and it`s way worse with other anime. Sometimes in this anime it`s even pretty enjoyable. It can give a nice relief to some of the intense situations that are going on. But if you wanted to skip the filler it`s really simple and obvious.
                  There are many sites that show which episodes are legit or not.
Characters:
So other than the Filler this is the greatest anime/tv show I have ever watched. Everything is so well done in this, the characters are all super likeable and perfect. Even the bad guys are awesome in this. Plus there are so many characters that its easy to get attatched to a couple of them. I guess it`s similar to One piece in that way, so if you liked One Piece you`re definitely going to like as much or probably more.
The animation and sound:
THe animation in this is well done, it`s definitely better than naruto was but it`s nothing groundbreaking. I didnt have any problems with the sound, I actually really loved the voice actors for english. Also has some pretty good action music and intros. Most of the songs are pretty great.
The story:
I loved the story to this anime. it has the perfect story. There is just the right amount of action, comedy and serious moments in this. 
Overall: 
I highly recommend that you watch this anime, it is long so it`ll take a while but it`ll definitely be worth it. You will feel like you lived an entirely different life.",10
"
                I have to say, this is one of the best anime I have ever seen. I've always neglected watching Naruto because of how big it is, but I finally took a chance, and finished it within 3 days because of how amazing the story development was. And now, Naruto Shippuuden is even better.
Story - 9
First of all, this an amazingly thought out story. From the history to the jutsu (ninja abilities), it all connected so well. The provided explanations for how the characters execute their abilities, it just can't compare to one piece, with how you eat some devil's fruit and gain powers. I understand
                  the stories are completely different, and one piece is one of my favorites, but Naruto is just so much better when it comes to being realistic, to the point that I wouldn't be surprised if there were actually ninja who could mold chakra in this world. Also, Naruto (shippuuden) is not one of those anime where the main characters are always able to win against an enemy. But that's what I love about it, and with how the main chars aren't just given massive powers from the start. They have to work for their skills. And even in the most dire situations, they aren't able to get past it.
Art - 10
Unlike ""modern day"" anime such as SAO, the character profiles aren't just smooshed at the mouth, nor are the nostrils just magically not there. All parts of anatomy are present! Other than that, the art is amazing, especially in battle scenes. Just watch it. You can understand what I mean.
Sound - 10
One of the main things that makes this anime so good is the ost and op... and the necessary, icky, but realistic, sound of weapons piercing flesh. The openings are really suitable to the anime, and it's a nice selection of music. Especially OP 3 (watch the anime to hear what it sounds like! don't just go to google). And then there's the sound tracks of the animation. Probably one of the best I've heard. Although each OST is suited to their situation and/or scene, it's mainly the sad tracks that wow me. They convey the perfect feeling of sorrow, whilst at the same time emulating the theme of Naruto. What I mean is, at sad moments, you feel sad, and it sounds like a typical Japanese instrument, which, in the Naruto time period, that's what people would be using. Tabun.
Character  - 10
Here we go! Well, actually, to see the char development you'd have to start from Naruto, when they were actually... developing. But from the start of Naruto to Shippuuden, the characters never fail to amaze me. If you had seen Naruto, you would assume the evil characters are just evil, the side characters are just boring, and the main characters are just the epitome of justice. No. All of the characters have another side to them, and I hadn't known that until watching Shippuuden. Even the side chars. Down to their family history, all of the characters are just so well developed. I hadn't even known (***spoiler*** well it's not that important anyway) Asuma was Sarutobi-sensei's son until season 2. Not to mention, who would have thought Naruto's teacher would be some perverted hermit, instead of a clean, know-it-all peacemaker. Like Konohamaru's teacher, you know, the guy with the glasses. JK.
Enjoyment - 9
I thoroughly enjoyed the anime the whole time, EXCEPT the fillers. Definitely not the fillers. eaughh. That doesn't mean all the fillers though. I just mean those fillers that don't show any character development, just another mission, or another waste of time. But that's only a small fragment of the anime. Shippuuden that is. For those of you who have seen Naruto, remember that massive section of fillers? Again, eaughh.
Overall - 10...00000000

"
                I've loved Naruto, me and him were born the same year, so I like to call this my Birth anime.
The message from Naruto:  this anime is very motivational and has taught me valuable lessons to life such as loving for others and to do my best no matter what and will always hold a place in my soul
The Characters to me I could always picture myself relating to each one heck sometimes i forget that it's an anime and I begin to think I am inside of it myself (when I'm watching it not all the time)
The soundtracks: Wonderful. I have downloaded quite a
                  bit of them onto my phone because that's how great they are to listen to! I'd suggest looking up the soundtracks yourself.
The art work: Why I'm gonna complain about this, is because closer to the end like episode 400 the developers were starting to get lazy and make mistakes that highly stick out. Like when Minato was reanimated they put his actual eyes instead.
                                         If you want an anime to relate yourself to, pick this one. Trust me it is great, no matter what those DBZ boys say.",9
"
                Story the same as Shonen Jump.  Not very smooth transitions between filler and cannon, not going to go into detail like last review.  The art in Shippuuden is up to date, a HUGE difference, it looks almost as good as the stuff in 2020.  Sound is the same as Shonen Jump, still amazing English wise.  Characters are the same, but now you introduce even more to the series!  Adding more story's to the Naruto Series!  I loved it, just as good as normal Naruto or better, since the fight scenes were much more epic, as mature Naruto is a
                  lot stronger.  Personally its a 10, but critically it cant hit a 10 due to the weak transition.  Still loved it and you should definitely start it after you finish Shonen Jump, as its a little better then Shonen Jump.",9
"
                I do have to say that most of the time I enjoy watching Naruto but it certainly has its flaws and is far from perfect. I also think that you can't just discard fillers as necessary and just discard them while writing a review. 
Lets start by looking at the most important part of an anime, the story.
The main story line is actually very well written and thought out. It gets me really into the anime and makes me want to keep watching all day if it were possible. Now the flaw are the fillers. Yes I know that fillers are necessary and I am
                  not saying that I disapprove of fillers. The problem I have with fillers in Naruto is the terrible quality and timing of them. If they were able to make a good storyline for them to follow during the fillers and not suddenly interrupt big moments in the anime I wouldn't mind that much at all.
There were even a few times where I dropped the anime in between because I got bored with it. But after a while I couldn't help myself to start watching again. The reason for this was the main storyline. Without the fillers I would have to give the story a 8 out of 10 but the fillers just take out too much.
The thing I have to like most of all are the characters. Al the important characters have their own background and there is no black and white way of looking at the. The bad guys are not all that bad, they all have there reasons and motivation why they are doing what they do. The only thing that bothers me is the recurring ""Naruto"" type character, that can perfectly relate with the lead character of the show. I feel like they are repeating the same character over and over with just a slight twist each time. 
So overall it is a good anime, and the main storyline is good enough to still make it enjoyable overall. I am still hoping that they'll remake the whole thing at some point and just remove all the filler material and also go over some of the artwork, because there were some moments wherein the animators seemed to be rushing.",7
"
                First of all i would like to pin-point a few things.I have watched all the known mainstream animes that many of us used to watch all these years. Bleach -One piece-Fairy tail( this is kinda a  new one comparison to the others) and i must sayNaruto is by far the best on all its aspects.
People hating  this anime where they havent even watched it is wierd 
Story 10-----This is one of the deepest animes i have seen. There are about 50-60 characters in this anime that all have their own stories which drag-on and they have their on impact  in the flow
                  of the anime.Putting together a solid story with all these characters and the actual story of the anime is something beyond difficult.
The clans, the villages, the bijuus, the skills, all the chakra explanation and the battle system.Naruto-Naruto Shippuuden its a world of its own running in a perfect flow.
Who would epect Obito would be alive after the accident, a story that took palce like 500 episodes ago-Naruto shippuuden does that, its not like the other animes that every episode erases its past and starts a new story , its a well-built story  with almost non-glitches
Sound 10-- 10 is too litle for the most succesfull anime in terms of soundtracks and music. Yashuharu Takanashi has done it again(and Toshio Masuda of course) all the tracks are masterpieces, no wonder why some of the tracks are of world fame and used  for other rasons aswell
Art 9-- Very much improved from its prodeccor Naruto-not eprfect though
Character 10---Who didint like that clumpsy loud voice kid at the first part of this anime...Naruto and the others have grown in Shippuuden but in a great way. Naruto has grown as much as he should be and changed as much as he should be.He is not a complitely different person  neither the others, but they all have added new aspects i their characters matching the years difference from Naruto.
Overall 10- Seriously Naruto Shippuuden is indeed a famous (maybe?)mainstream anime?. So what?? That doesnt make it  bad.Its a high quality anime , one of the best that ever have been aired with very deep story, best music ever made, quite good art and amazing characters. Highly recommend it to everyone(MANDATORY u have watched Naruto first)",10
"
                Story continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable.
Story in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is blinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying
                  to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination.
Animation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the ""characters move so fast""... .",2

                I was skeptical at first with Naruto Shippuden because shonen anime has a terrible reputation for being too long, drawn-out, and humorless. But now, after watching the series, I think that Naruto Shippuden deserves all the praise that it gets. 
Following the sequel to the original Naruto, Naruto Shippuden follows the story of our favorite hyperactive knucklehead ninja, Naruto Uzumaki. Only, this time, Naruto and his friends are teenagers. This anime can be divided into 2 main arcs, the Akatsuki arc, and The Fourth Great Ninja War arc. 
The Akatsuki arc is the superior of the 2 arcs listed above. Back in Naruto, we were
                  introduced to a criminal organization with unknown motives. In Naruto Shippuden, Naruto and his friends will fight all the Akatsuki members. The Akatsuki is undoubtedly one of the best evil anime organizations ever. Each character is so unique and has their own little unique quirk. 
The Fourth Great Ninja War is arguably the decline of the Naruto series. Retcons, power escalation, and insane amounts of fillers contribute to The Fourth Great Ninja War's flaws. But even after all that, The Fourth Great Ninja War is still in my opinion, decent. It expanded the lore of the Naruto series and tied all loose ends of the narrative. The Fourth Great Ninja War was also filled with suspense, thrill, and mystery. The fights scenes are also ones to behold, there were so many fantastic fights scenes in The Fourth Great Ninja War. Some people say that this arc will Naruto's downfall, while others loved it for the fantastic fight scenes. Really, my largest complaint about The Fourth Great Ninja War was the finale. 
People gripe about the amount of fillers in Naruto Shippuden, but I think that is unjustified. Now that the show is finished, you can just skip the fillers. And I highly advise you do.
The art is outstanding, like most shonen animes. It is one of the better drawn shonen animes, although definitely not the best. I think it is better than One Piece's art but worse than Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball, and Bleach.
The soundtrack for Naruto Shippuden is outstanding. It has one of the best soundtrack I have ever had the privilege to listen too. Its soundtrack is up there with Fairy Tail and Death Note.
The amount of character development in Naruto Shippuden is amazing. My only gripe about it is that some of the amazing side characters that were hyped in part one get sidelined. Characters like Neji, Gaara, and Rock Lee had so much more potential. The main character's developments are one of the best in shonen anime.
I immensely enjoyed Naruto Shippuden and I would recommend it to everyone.",10
"
                Story: the world building/lore is amazing, the story is incredible, though it may get a bit repetitive when approaching the end of the story. Solid 9/10
Art: It starts of very good, though not perfect, but it just keeps getting better throughout the series (except for naruto vs pain LOL). Solid 9/10
Sound: the music is simply the best i've ever heard. very emotional, exciting music.  Beats fairy tail for me. (same composer tho). 10/10
character: absolutely love almost every character. literally everyone is just amazing. the legendary sannin, akatsuki, (previous) kage, itachi, madara, literally everyone. Another reason i adore the show. Well deserved 10/10
Enjoyment: I can't
                  even describe how much i enjoyed watchen Naruto. Just know i did. Best 10/10 i'v ever given.

                Just like most of the people I know I also started watching anime from Naruto.. it is the best anime I ever seen.. best story.. best characters..  It's just perfect but the thing that bother me so much are the filler episodes..  I think no one is interested in fillers. They r ruining the whole anime by adding fillers.. for example in recent episodes (394 to onwards) what was the logic in showing chunin exams when both Naruto and Sasuke r dead??  They were not even in the chunin exams... Fillers r destroying this best anime.

                I said I was gonna go to bed but I lied.....I'm not gonna write much as I know some people have a serious problem with naruto and I can totally understand why. Instead of grading Naruto Im gonna just do The good, The bad, and The Ugly. 
""Your doing something different? Thats so stupid and wiierd. Why would you do that?"" 
It's simpler, faster, easier, and because f**k you, thats why.
THE GOOD:
Story has a very fun and interesting premise with tons of action, superpowers, ninjas, respect, badass fight and much more. The story is so long and complex it really has some great plot twists
                  that are a pleasure to watch even if you know it's going to happen 50 episodes before it happens (because most of us read the manga). 
The characters are awesome and you become attached to them the more you watch. They all have flaws, they all have personality, and they all have history. It all ties together quite nicely over the years since this anime began.
THE BAD:
This is strictly my opinion so feel free to completely disregard this section and go onto the next because I know for a fact that alot of people will not agree with what Im about to say.
It didnt have enough romance, there I said it. I think there could have been a few places where romance could have boosted this anime up to around an 8.4ish score. Once again I dont expect people to agree with this so please disregard this section if you disagree. I would actually appreciate a personal message telling me what you think about this whether its good or bad. Im very interested on what you guys have to say about this topic and upcoming movie. Anyway, moving on.
THE UGLY:
Im pretty sure you all know what I'm goin to say...and yes you are right....FILLERS. Now dont get me wrong. I grew up with Naruto starting in 5th grade and this show holds a special place in my heart. But I gotta say, there is nothing worst then a very important climax or battle arc getting interrupted by a stupid filler. It can be a complete turn off. Are some of them fun to go back and watch? yes! of course! but the timing of them is horribly off in my opinion and they can get lengthy and as you watch more of them you start getting angry and frustrated. ""this is pointless"" probably describes the feeling best to some of you. 
THE OVERALL: 9 in my personal enjoyment, 8 in terms of quality overall (as a critic)
 I have been watching for so many years now so it is really hard for me to critique this fairly. I hope for the most part you guys understand where Im coming from. Overall this anime is a great watch. Probably will be a classic when its all over, but that will be along time from now.
Im extremely jealous of anyone just starting the series now because you get to skip all those fillers. But yeah, please watch it, it only gets better as you watch and the more you watch the more you wont be able to stop.

"
                Building off the great foundation the first series had, Shippuden is nothing short of amazing. The villains are the main draw here. However, the good guys are also awesome as well. 
I personally love how the fights end without discovering who is the strongest but who that person really is. This show gets a lot of hate and I believe it's completely for stupid reasons. Kishimoto makes bold choices when it comes to his story and some fans don't seem to like those choices. I personally love them all and believe this is one of the best long running anime series alongside other greats like
                  One Piece, Hunter X Hunter and Bleach.",10
"
                I loved the first Naruto series. I love Naruto Shippuuden. Shippuuden has so much potential to be better than the first Naruto in so many ways without really having to do much because its just that good but theres just one problem, fillers. The amount of fillers in Naruto Shippuuden is just ridiculous and that's no opinion it is a fact. I give Shippuuden an 8.5/10 instead of a 10/10 just because of the huge amount of fillers it has. Its a shame too.

"
                After watching this show I realized if I hadn't watched this, I would have missed an outstanding story. Being a grown-up, at first I didn't like it, but as the story went deeper and deeper into the center part, I started liking it.
First of all, the main difference between Naruto and Shippuden is the darker tone, the maturity in shippuden. The whole Naruto and Shippuden was about Naruto wanting to become hokage, and more powerful than Sasuke so that he can bring him to the right path. I love Naruto's cheerfulness throughout the story, though in Shippuden he becomes more serious and more powerful also.
In
                  the story, once Kakashi told one of Naruto's special abilities was to make friends with anyone he meets, this trait of him makes him more powerful. Akatsuki, the moon plan, mystery behind Tobi's mask, the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, all of this make me love this show. The first half was all about the foundation that Kishimoto laid for us to walk on, and in the Shippuden he digs into the core of the story.
There are tons of emotional moments in this series, that sometimes make you laugh, some that make you really angry, and some make you cry with them. Of course, the art is much better than Naruto, Shippuden has a lot attention to character details, their outfits, and it has become more colorful and the character movements are better drawn which feels more realistic to me.
i would like to say that it has some truly brilliant fight scenes animated. The 'taijiutsu' scenes are so perfect in character movements and it didn't overlooked the physics too. One of the best fight scenes to me was Naruto vs Sasuke in the first half.
In Naruto and Shippuden both Kishimoto tried his best to tell almost all character stories being not focused in Naruto only. All characters have their own backgrounds and special personalities, they all feel like real people and they grow throughout the series.
At some point, when Sasuke becomes evil and still Naruto wants to bring him back home, many people will call this as 'gay' nature of Naruto, but this isn't true.
“They say wherever someone is still thinking of you, that place is your home.” -Jiraiya | Naruto. This is one of some marvelous quotes from this series. I think this is why Naruto never stalls to think about Sasuke whom he saw as his elder brother.
But there is a warning. Before you start watching this series you have to know the use of fillers. Fillers are not part of the main story, they are to support the writer to keep up with the pace of the anime. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of manga. When the anime goes too far, to buy some time for the writer, they make use of fillers. Some fillers contain good fights, but you can skip them, it won't hamper your enjoyment with the story.
Naruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wants to become hokage not knowing how hardship it requires, to a serious, hardworking loyal friend who not only wants to save his friend but also the whole shinobi world from the never-ending cycle of hatred and despair. I enjoyed the series and I bet you will do too.",10
"
                I just got into Anime a couple years ago. My most favorite will always be Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden. It's the only anime so far that has gotten me to cry a lot. I feel all the things that the characters are going through. It's about friendship,family,pride of where you come from. This show makes me laugh,makes me cry, I've even yelled at my computer screen when things happen I don't like. lol. I never came across any show like Naruto that had me fall completely in love with it. I do admit when I heard of this show I thought it was just for kids. That
                  it was going to be this lame kid show. Boy was I wrong! My sister actually got me into anime and introduced me to Naruto. I'm so glad she did! I thank her like everyday. I love everything about Naruto. The storyline,the characters,music,animation. EVERYTHING!!. Naruto is always in my heart. Hands down the best anime! This is my opinion though. People have others that they love more or what they think is the best ever. I've told some other anime fans that Naruto was my most fav and they would laugh. Doesn't bother me any because it's what I like not what they like.",10
"
                Naruto Shippuden is a good Anime in my opinion. I know many people look upon Naruto as being ""mainstream"" and somehow inferior to other Anime, they are right and wrong.
I like Naruto because of the troubled lives that the Shinobi live and the morals that the show tries to impart to the viewers although that is lost on most people.
Shippuden has a more refined feel than Naruto part 1 and that's most likely due to the development and maturity of the characters. Naruto as always stimulates powerful moments of emotional empathy from the viewers and always transfers some wisdom to the viewer, most notably relating
                  to friendship, family and duty. 
The overall main story arc is interesting and has many interesting developments which show what it's like to live the ninja life. There is Naruto's humor which still creates funny moments although that isn't as big of a part of Shippuden as it was in Part 1. The combat is also interesting and fun to watch.
Now for the bad parts that makes people view Naruto in a negative way. There is many fillers which seem completely pointless and while that's not really an issue if you are able to trick yourself into liking them, It is very boring to watch. There are repetitive elements which can become stale after a while but if you become a fan you can overlook the repetitiveness. 
In short: Naruto Shippuden isn't close to being perfect, but you will learn to care about the characters, mostly Naruto which greatly helps enjoy the show. It's interesting to watch but requires a lot of time since there is so many episodes and if you watch part 1 also (I suggest you do) then that adds up to quite a lot of time. Perhaps find a list of filler episodes and skip them. 
Give it 10 episodes to see if you enjoy it.",8
"
                After the marathon of Naruto, we end up here, Shippuuden.
Naruto left the leaf village with Jiraiya and has been away for 2 and a half years.
That's a massive time jump, so it's going to take a while to learn the little bits and pieces of everything that's been happening while they were away, with both Naruto and Jiraiya, plus all the friends they left behind.
It kicks straight into the main story pretty much immediately, while you're getting all the information about what's been happening in the background. 
The Akatsuki are ready to make their move, Orochimaru is still with Sasuke and the Leaf Village has
                  been waiting for what Orochimaru has planned and for Naruto to return.
It's really nice to see the progress in the characters, they're still technically kids, but it doesn't seem like it at all. Maybe except for Naruto, he's still pretty immature, the difference is he knows when it's okay to let that side of him out.. Most of the time. It's obvious they've all learned a lot, and it's exciting to see what's different with everyone as time goes on. 
The fillers are more abundant than before, but they're still worth watching. Most of them have some main story material through them, though mostly small pieces, they're still important to see.
A part I really enjoyed was learning more about characters other than Naruto, seeing as it's such a big series, the other main characters and background ones are still very prominent, it's interesting and you need to learn more about them to see why they are who they are. Once it gets into it, a lot of them have similar backgrounds of losing people and it helps explain why they're all so drawn to and supportive of Naruto and his mission. 
Their backstories really help lay out the plot in more detailed means, it's great when small plot points spiderweb into backgrounds of different people and it all comes together.
Though, you only get the full experience of it by watching the fillers, as that's where most of that information comes from. 
One of Naruto's best qualities is that he has such a big heart, like many characters say, he has the ability to inspire anybody without even trying, and he cares so much. 
Though from that, Shippuuden isn't holding back on the deaths.. It is a war, after all. So be prepared to be both incredibly sad and really shocked. I was so devastated at one of them I wanted to just quit the series, hibernate for a few days and never return. This is 1 of 3 anime that has made my heart sink to that extent. 
What adds to the sadness is how caring Naruto is, even people just getting hurt upsets him and makes him so angry that sometimes bad things happen. But when people he cares for die, especially ones that are so close to him, the emotions for that through Naruto are portrayed so well, seeing him cry and be so hurt just makes your heart ache. 
Big questions start to get answered around halfway through, all the little bits and pieces start making sense and coming together to completely flip situations and the story you thought certain characters had. It's done really well, so it feels even more satisfying when the questions come to light.
I'm finishing writing this halfway through, it's a lot to watch all at once unless you've been watching it bit by bit or as it released. 
Like the previous, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought it would. Naruto in general gets a lot of judgement for having so much filler. In the first half the characters are kiddy and pretty annoying if you're watching a lot at once, but once you get past that it's a decent series. 
I don't regret putting so much time into it and I'm actually looking forward to wherever it may lead. 
This part is definitely better than the first, the story, characters and flow of the series is nicely done and you can't help but crave to know what happens next.
If you're looking at watching this you've either watched Naruto and you're moving on, which you'll really enjoy the evolution of the series. Or you've heard Shippuuden is good but are weary about the amount of episodes and fillers involved, or have trouble pushing through the first part. If you enjoy long series, with adventures, fighting, regular character growth (excluding the time skip but it's pretty well explained so it doesn't really count), good comedy with some pervy goodness added in, plus all the other things the series brings, it'll be worth it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",8
"
                Ok to start with naruto this is one of the first anime that i had ever watched when i was a kid. Naruto is the type of anime that has good character storiesx due to its long run and has a decent story in which usually doesnt stale in my eyes atleast. I really enjoy naruto definetly one of favorites but it does have alot of flaws. First of all the art style tends to change just recently in the story the art style changed from what it was before its not a big change but its still there. Second HUGE flaw about this series
                  is the constant filler in this anime we will get around 3 episodes of cannon and then get thrown into flashbacks and even sometimes it will takes months off of the story to show us a full filler arc and the amount that it happens makes watching very boring but they do make up for it when the story usually resumes. Another thing that can sometimes be wierd is the animation it can be good and it can also be at a stand still and just freeze at times. In my opinion Naruto is a good show to watch its a 10/10 in my book just because of my connection but for the average person a good 8/10 sounds about right give it a watch if you like long running shows.

"
                Naruto Shippuden is hyped up way too much. It's just average at best in my opinion. The show's only strong point is nostalgia and the music.
STORY/PLOT:  We see Naruto after a three-year time skip. He has gotten taller and has definitely changed in some way. The MC who rebelled that he won't become a tool to the village, in turn, becomes one because he wishes to be acknowledged by them and become Hokage.
Naruto's goal mostly in Shippuden is to bring Sasuke back. He trains hard and learns a new Jutsu and sage mode. Shippuden completely debunks the fact that Naruto is an underdog.
                  He is apparently a child with powerful parents and has genetics in his favor, he's also CHILD OF THE PROPHECY and REINCARNATION OF NINJA JESUS. How inconsistent!
Sasuke was more of a protagonist than Naruto himself. He killed a major villain, gathered a team, and freed the captives. He learned a lot of Jutsu by himself and kept moving towards his goal. Itachi was a confusing mess of a character. He should've remained the heartless brother and the war criminal who betrayed his own clan. He also mentally tortured his younger brother.
The Akatsuki were an interesting bunch. Pein arc is said to be one of the best arcs in the show. But it ended badly. Pein was too easily influenced by the mc. Obito was pathetic as a villain. Madara was too over-powered. Kaguya was unnecessary. It was a play of flashy powers and magic eyeballs with huge power-ups.
The story went downhill. The ending was a huge disappointment. Too many plot holes, Naruto gets married to an irrelevant side character and Kakashi is Hokage? The ending was heavily from Hinata's perspective, Naruto wasn't even planning to get married. Sasuke's character never got proper closure, the same with Naruto. Konoha side characters are just shoved aside, Neji accepts his destiny and dies for NH.
Why is Kakashi Hokage again?
ART: The animation was good, the fights were animated well. But ofc the quality tends to go down at times. Naruto's design was bland, Sakura's outfit just sucked and Sasuke kept changing styles. It wasn't much of a bother.
SOUND: This show put out some really good themes and music. The themes were also pretty good. 
CHARACTERS: Sadly the characters weren't all that great. The females were poorly written, as always. Naruto doesn't learn anything from his experiences. He's a mere teen with absolutely no understanding of how the world and Shinobi system works. But still, he has plot armor and his talk no Jutsu to the villains is rarely challenged.
Sasuke's character doesn't get a proper closure. He wanted a revolution in the Shinobi world. But he's convinced to give up on his goal and goes on a journey to atone for his sins.
Character potential is a red herring for side characters. Shikamaru's development arc was just not out there. There was too much emphasis on Uchiha Senju drama. I didn't like the concept of how the Uchihas are genetically evil and the Senjus good. 
OVERALL: It wasn't that great. The immense number of fillers doesn't help. The pacing was terrible, flashbacks overused. The ending was just a shipping frenzy.  The show has its good points - the characters had interesting backgrounds and brought up a lot of issues. Sadly those were not worked out well.",6
"
                I don't even know where to begin. When I started watching the original Naruto it was great, tons of potential but once it hit shippuuden it didn't just go down hill, it flew down vertically with no stop in sight. It's depressing to see an anime with a lot of potential be destroyed. As it continues it looks like they are trying to squeeze out all the money possible out of this story instead of just ending it. Many people would disagree with me and a majority wont really give arguments other than being a fan boy but anyway here's my review.
Story - Originally the
                  story was supposed to be about a failure ninja who is hated by everyone because of the beast in him. He cries all the time, is extremely annoying to all his peers yet he still blames his beast for being hated. Anyway, the whole plot to this anime is to create bonds, friendships, and get acceptance with the title of ""Hokage"". In the first part of the Naruto series that's exactly what he worked to do and now with shippuuden everything changes, no more bonds, no more friendship, it's just an anime that resembles some sort of animal trade using tailed beasts. Naruto continues to chase sasuke and even after all the advantages hes born with he continues to not be able to catch him. Theres virtually no training in this anime at all, just free powers given over and over. Villains are just a line of people controlling one another.
Art - Basic, Average, Modern, not unique. Most of the characters all look like they have been drawn using the same template. Just take off naruto's hair and eyes, throw in sasuke's hair and eyes, BOOM flawless.
Sound - The music isn't anything special, usually its an asain man yelling what sounds like ""SEA SAW"" at you with background music.
Characters - Not unique, very obvious copy of DBZ.
naruto - Easily resembles goku, orange suit, blonde hair, raised by an old guy(hokage), both become monsters with a tail. Only difference is while naruto cried his whole childhood, goku lived alone with innocence.
Sasuke - Very obvious copy of vegeta, from the hair, to the death of his whole race and getting revenge.
Jiraya - Narutos, frog sage, old, perverted teacher, very similar to roshi, goku's turtle sage, old perverted teacher. Even the way naruto received training was similar, both asked for a large breasted hot girl.
Enjoyment - At first it was enjoyable, now it makes you wanna rip your hair out at how ridiculous it is.
Overall - 5/10 - and with good reason.",5
"
                I'm sorry.. it's just so bad in my opinion of course.
The art is dumbed down from the original series, the sound is... pretty much the same stuff. The character development for the new characters is pretty good...
Enjoyment.. is bad because.. well... FILLERS... EVERYWHERE... it tries making you bored out of your mind or on the edge of your seat so even the most pointless event seem exciting. It's dragged out so long. I believe it should only be around 50-100 episodes. I quit watching the original Naruto at like 80 then started watching Shippuuden because my friend really likes it, but we literally skimmed through
                  the first 40 episodes within about 2 hours, and I did not miss any details at all. I discussed the main bad points about Naruto with my friend and he agreed with all of them which include the ones that I have talked about before.
They're overcomplicating it in my opinion, and should stay focused on the main problem, create ""sub""-problems that lead up to ending the main conflict, which seem to be the problem with a lot of mainstream shounen anime. They try making a series as long as possible to make the most money out of it rather then creating a good story, with good art, and characters that a person will thoroughly enjoy.
Overall, Naruto Shippuuden gets a 5/10, There are a lot of shorter anime series that gets to the point of the anime which are much more exciting, because they cram all their interesting ideas into a short time span rather than having a single event drag out over a term of 3-10 episodes.",5
"
                So, this review contains spiders and spoilers so watch out. This isn’t going to be a spoiler free review, because I feel like I need to talk about specific things in the show to fully explain my opinion and score of it. So if you haven’t seen the show and don’t wanna be spoiled, stop reading. 
Gosh… where do I start when talking about Naruto Shippuden? If I was to graph the quality of the series as it went on it would look a lot like a sin curve, with a big old dip right at the end of it. The individual arcs are just
                  so inconsistent with one another in terms of quality. And for every great arc like the Pain Assult or Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant there is an equally bad thing, such as the seemingly endless, fillerific and boring Fourth Shinobi War arc. 
I guess if you were to list everything that happens in Naruto Shippuden as either good or bad then the good would potentially outweigh the bad by a tiny bit. But the problem is the bad bits are so bad that they really do drag down the great bits of the show. The show has this incredibly strong fetish for redeeming villains as they die, which I think is fine to occasionally do when it fits, but if you try to do it for every villain, which Naruto has a lot of, then it just feels so damn shoehorned. For example, Pain was an amazing villain and the two arcs with him as the major bad guy are some of the greatest anime episodes I have ever watched. It was tense, there was death, character arcs and consequences and Naruto’s fight with him truly was his graduation into being a fully-fledged hero after so long. Then when he was defeated Pain just decided to become good for poorly explained reasons and brought back everyone he had killed besides one person back to life. Effectively ruining and retconning most of the good stuff he as a villain did. And for what? To make you feel bad for the guy that just spent the last 20 episodes being ninja Stalin? Scenes like that just reverse half an arc really paint a picture that this story really wasn’t planned out very well, if at all. 
And that ending… it honestly goes against fundamental storytelling basics. To briefly explain it, after flip flopping between major villains like it was going out of style, it looked like Madara Uchiha would be it, the big baddie was finally settled. They managed to set it up so that he was the mastermind and cause of almost everything evil in the plot, from the nine-tails attack to the actions of most of the other major villains to the death of the girl that turned Obito into an evil person. They made him complex, making him not specifically evil, he just wanted everyone to not have to suffer like he did and have a blissful, perfect life. His plan had even succeeded, and only Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi and Sakura were awake to stop him. And he had basically become a ninja god and is ready to unleash his full power on them. Then… he just is killed and replaced by someone we had heard about once beforehand. No foreshadowing about it, the villain the show had spent so long building up had been swapped with some random woman that was purely evil with vague motivations who is pretty quickly dispatched of. What was the point of that? To extend this crap even further? 
As for the fillers, well to be fair to they are better than the filler bits from the original Naruto, which were painful. Yeah it isn’t amazing television but filler arcs like the Three Tails one could be decent enough time wastes, and seeing the fillers flesh out some of the backstory of the world was nice. But the repeated flashbacks are a huge issue, I swear some of them were repeated like once an episode at some points. If I hear Obito say his stupid line about ninjas who abandon others being scum once more I think I might try to eat my desk. 
There is also a big problem with the side characters in that most of them are at points interesting but by the end of the show they are cast aside so that the show can focus just on Sakura, Kakashi, Naruto and Sasuke. And apart from Kakashi all of the main good guy characters are all just kinda… boring and bland. Except for Sasuke, he is just terrible and dumb. I get that in a series with as many side characters as Naruto you can’t focus on all of them but seeing characters like Sai get so much work done early on in the series to make him somewhat interesting just to be completely ignored by the end is unsatisfying. But that sums up the problem with Naruto, it takes one step backwards for every single one it takes forward. It has so much promise and goodness, then it has a bunch of lacklustre stuff and badness to follow it up. 
If I am being honest, Naruto Shippuden is enjoyable. There is enough good stuff and enough great stuff to entertain you, especially the bits directly from the manga. But if you are like me you will get frustrated watching it. It has the big problem where if a little more planning, polish and forethought was put into it then you would seriously have one amazing series. But the imperfections build, and they only get more and more noticeable as the show goes on. Heck I have barely spoken about the plot. But that is because the plot is hard to explain. Whilst not confusing it just goes all over the place, which isn’t at all helped by the constant passing of the ‘main bad guy’ torch. 
And I hope I am not sounding too harsh with this review, because I don’t hate this show. I want to like it, because I remember sections of it like the Team 10 vs Hidan and Kakuzu fight or the Jiraiya vs Pain battle and really want to like it. But then I remember the niggling problems that bubble and build up as the show goes on, so I can’t give it a higher rating than a 5. I mean the soundtrack is at least pretty damn great. Give it a go but don’t be surprised if you end up hating it for its flaws.",5

                God do I love this show. Yup, I'm another generic childhood fan, but I'm still going to write a review. 
I'll be fair, and point out the cons first. The first major con, the sheer amount of filler is crazy. I remember enjoying some of the filler, but most of it I would skip. Next, the flashback scenes. Sometimes flashbacks are necessary if it's been a while and you may have forgotten some details, however, it's not necessary every other episode. They were fine with the flashbacks until a certain point, then it got annoying. There, cons are finished, so let me speak of the
                  pros now.
 The music for one is amazing. They know how to hype you up with the music, and it works every time. The opening theme songs are honestly some of the best you'll ever find, and I will fight anyone on that. The characters, antagonists and plot are also interesting and keep you invested. There are very few anime that make me feel the way this does. I'm being biased, I admit, but I'm not going to remove my rose-colored glasses. The animation is fantastic and the fights intense, I always loved it when Shikamaru fought. All in all, my love for this show is a mixture of nostalgia and the fact that it really is amazing.",10
"
                I'll be honest: I didn't like Naruto that much. 
Now before you think I've gone nuts, hear me out. I liked the premise of the story and I enjoyed the beginning of the series quite a lot as well. The sound track is pretty nice, albeit a little dramatic at times and I liked the animation. I liked most of the characters, even. But there were a few things that really killed the series for me.
 One issue was that there were way too many fillers. Even die-hard Naruto fans will agree with me on this. There were so many just useless episodes about random
                  missions or life at Konoha or whatever, that I started to get sick of watching. Some of them were nice, I'll admit, but most of them added basically nothing to the story line and got on my nerves. Out of the 500 episodes of Naruto, at least 100 are fillers and for me, that is just waaay too many. 
There was also an issue of a few plot holes and good ideas that were not revisited at all, which got me mildly to thoroughly irritated from time to time based on how interested I was in the idea. But in the long run, I don't think that problem alone would have made me dislike the series as much as I do.
This next one is kind of personal preference. Although Naruto doesn't have a bunch of blatant fan service or girls in bikinis and whatnot. I eventually got sick of the fact that almost every new female character was introduced with an obligatory butt shot or boob shot. For some of them it was more odd and out-of-place than the others, but overall I'd say that the idea just kind of got old. Fan service in general isn't really my thing, but I don't mind it that much if it doesn't become a central part of the story. Once again, however, this is just personal preference, so if you like fan service or don't find butt/boob shots boring, this won't bother you at all. 
But the biggest issue I had was the Sharingan (an eye that grants the user access to special techniques). In the beginning, I really liked the idea of an eye that can copy other jutsu (ninja techniques that are somewhat like magic, but marginally explained) instantaneously. It was an interesting idea and I looked forward to its uses and how it would be developed. I expected there to be some kind of upgrade to it. So when Itachi (one of the characters) showed up with a Mangekyo Sharingan that was very useful to for genjustu (marginally explained mind control), I accepted it. I didn't really get how someone could get from a copying eye to any eye that can hypnotize people, but I just kind of shrugged and went with it. But when Sasuke (one of the main characters) and Itachi started to yank literal skeleton monsters out of their eyeballs, I got super irritated. Explain to me how in the world we got from a copying eye to an eye that has enough room to fit a skeleton. At this point the writer was blatantly just adding complete bs to the Sharingan in order to make Sasuke look more ""badass"". Sure, it made him look marginally more competent, but to me, it was just irritating. It made no sense in any way, shape, or form and was just a major plot hole and turnoff. The final nail in the coffin was when a villain with the Sharingan showed up with a dimension in his eyeball. How? Just how? You're really telling me that there is now a special dimension accessible to Sharingan users that no one had any prior knowledge/ idea about? What does the main ability of the Sharingan, the copy cat eye, have to do with pulling dimensions out of thin air? It was like the writer was trying to see how far he could go with just random, unexplained power ups to the Sharingan. It was infuriating, stupid, and I lost what little respect and awe I had for the Sharingan I had with this ""new ability"". The entire constant evolution issue with the Sharingan was even further offset and outlined by the Byakagan (another eye that gives the person access to special justu). The Byakagan was established as very strong and blatantly more powerful than the Sharingan at the beginning of the series. So when I noticed that the Sharingan was turning into some kind of a monster, God-like eye, I expected some sort of special Byakagan to form. But the Byakagan stayed completely the same from episode 1 to episode 500. If you're going to power up one eye so much, at least stay consist and do something to the other one! 
Overall, some parts of the story were done really well. Some aspects of the plot and some of the messages wrapped up in this story are good. But some things in the story just completely killed it for me and even though I watched the entire series, I kind of wish I had just dropped it once the problems became too much for me to handle. Even so, a lot of people like Naruto and there is nothing wrong with that. I just listed what issues made Naruto a no-go for me. So if you have read the plot summary and don't have any issues with the problems I outlined above, go for it! Hopefully you will enjoy Naruto more that I did.",5

                Naruto Shippuden is the continuation of Naruto. Naruto Shippuden is definitely better than Naruto. Here's is what I thought about the show so far:
Story: The story is pretty interesting and unpredictable. You not going to know what going to happen next. Some episodes might be drag on and a big amount of flashbacks are shown in almost every episode so it might be a little bit boring for some people. If you are a patience person then you can make it through the show, the show gets better as time goes on.
Art: The art is a step-up from the original series but I woudn't said
                  that the art is great. I noticed that Naruto Shippuden uses different animation in different arcs. The show never stick with one animation. Some episodes the animation might be really good and some episodes the animation is just horrible. Overall, most episodes have decent animation so the art wouldn't be a big problem.
Sound: Naruto Shippuden's Soundtrack is not as good as the first series. However, The OPs and EDs are great.
Character: Naruto Shippuden have a variety of characters with different personalities. Some characters had developed while some other characters didn't develop much (except their appearance). The characters in Shippuden are lovable so I beleived that you guys will find at least one person that you like.
Overall: Naruto Shippuden might be boring in some cases but if you are patience, you will be rewarded BECAUSE WHEN NARUTO SHIPPUDEN IS GOOD, IT'S GOOD.",8

                All I have to say is that Naruto Shippuuden is one of the best Animes you'll ever see. A lot of people disagree, either because they're hipsters who try to dislike anything that's popular, because of it being popular, or, because shonen is mostly for young boys and they're under the distorted conception that anything for kids is crap. I mean, other than the fillers and poor animation, the Anime is of a very, very high standard; not many other Animes have such in-depth characters as for example Itachi Uchiha. Nor are many other Animes able to convey, and bring out from you, the levels
                  of emotion that this Anime does. Seriously, it is GOOD. Especially the episode I just watched that made me want to express how good of an Anime Naruto Shippuden actually is. Seriously..... I really do hate how this is a 7/10 here. I get it, the filler and animation are bad, but the amazing story makes it all worth it.",10

The greatest story there ever was, a modern epic, the most important produce of the manga/anime industry. Each character represents the diverse emotional problems people face in their lives. There is a war-torn era, a post-war era and another war-torn era, and finally an era of peace. In all this, the mangaka didn't forget to show how it all began, giving a very interesting symbolic history of the world's past. Then, there are the heart-wrenching representations of the war-orphans, the downtrodden, the outcasted and even the privileged. The antagonists
                  have also been shown to possess really important reasons to turn against the norms. Philosophies of peace, conviction, life, death, art, purpose, etc are voluminous. As a shounen, it has the most creative battle scenes and character developments. The art and animation are brilliant. There are references to Japanese, Indian and other cultures, traditions and myths throughout the story. The sacrifices done for national cause, the underlying political crises, all are shown with brilliant symbolism. Kishimoto is a rare genius and should be considered a legend. The beautiful background scores and heart-touching ending songs all make it a very emotional watch. Especially, the MC being the most motivational and iconic character in any work of fiction. A must watch for every being living in this world!
Note: The DIRAI technique of rating was developed by me. Five criteria to rate any work of art, across any genre. The aggregate of these five lends the final rate. All five criteria are equally necessary. You can't call one greater than the other.
-Depth is the layered meaning of a story. How symbolic or allegorical a work of art is.
-Importance is how necessary a work is. How significant it is with respect to social, historical, philosophical, political and scientific standpoints.
-Relevance is how appropriate a work of art is with respect to the current time, period or circumstances. It lends weight to the work. Even symbolic reference to the modern civilization is a great factor for relevance.
-Artistry is how a work of art is executed or portrayed.
-Imagination is the thinking up of new ideas. Be it in the form of new characters or a mind blowing story, a new tune or a new kind of literature itself.
P.S.: Lots of reviewers tend to rate works by how much they were able to relate. I do not even consider that a factor. Entertainment and relatability are not proper criteria for reviews. Well, whatever, thank you. This is my first review, I shall be posting more very soon.",10

                (Some minor spoilers up ahead, sorry)
Ah, Naruto Shippuden! Where do I begin with this anime? I used to be so in denial about Naruto, I used to hate it because of it's notoriously cringy fanbase and the comments about the show that I had heard even though I hadn't watched it. But now that I have finished it, I feel like a new man :D. 
Also, I know I'm kind of late on writing a review about this show as it finished about a year ago and there has been a load of reviews about this show, but I felt like I needed to express
                  how I feel about this magical show. And please bear with me, I'm not a pro reviewer or anything of the sort, but I did my best. (Also comment on my profile if you have anything to tell me about this review, it is important to me how people feel about my writing.)
Let's begin!
Story - 8.5
The story may seem really simple and stupid at first if you only read the short synopsis of the anime, but to me it is a complex and engaging story with many plotholes, funny moments and lots of emotion, even if it's an anime about ninjas not really being ninjas. I vividly remember just sitting at the edge of my seat or laying in bed buried in blankets just being excited about what was going to happen next. I even watched this show in school when we would get laptops for , well, school work on them. That's how hooked I was. I've also heard a lot of backlash from people about the final arc, the 4th Ninja War arc and I can kind of see why, but I think people are definitely exaggerating over it. Yes the pacing was at it's slowest then. Yes there were lots of flashbacks. Yes, Kaguya was a bad plothole. But at the end of the day, this is also the arc where Madara truly shined as a character, and not just Madara, Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Obito, Guy, the Akatsuki members, Gaara, and many, many more. This is the arc where we got some of the best fights in the whole series. This is the arc when the big, ""evil"" plan of the Akatsuki was revealed. I feel that this arc is mentioned only as a con of the series despite all of the great things it had going for it. This arc is not the best, but it is not the worst and it definitely did NOT KILL Naruto.
Characters - 9
This anime had some of the best characters the anime medium could offer as a whole. From the strong loser Naruto to the evil but also friendly Obito, these characters are really just unforgettable. Even some of the filler characters are really likeable. Not to mention the villains. I could honestly say that Naruto Shippuden contains my favorite villains I've seen in any show or movie. So why is this section only a 9 then you may ask? Well, its because this series also had a few not so good characters. There's a handful of some I really don't like but I'm going to give you my top 3. Tenten, Danzo and Sasuke. Tenten was just really annoying, Danzo was just an unlikeable lunatic with delusions of grandeur (Basically a worse version of Tobirama) but I think Kishi tried to give him a hidden finesse so he is the one out of these 3 who I dislike the least, and Sasuke, who had potential to be among my favorite characters, but in my opinion he turned out to be the biggest and the most retarded douchebag in the whole series. I honestly don't know why Naruto liked the guy so much. Again, Kishi tried to give Sasuke a lot of finesse and depth, and yes, I admit that he had a very complex development but his ignorance, cockyness and overambitiousness just made me dislike the character.
Art - 8
I'm going to be honest with y'all, Naruto Shippuden had really bad animation at the start of the series. It was an upgrade form the original Naruto, but not by a lot. It sometimes felt a bit lazy too, but you must take to consideration that Naruto is a longrunning anime. When watching a longrunning anime, this is a risk you must take. Despite this, most of the fight scenes were fucking beautiful and when the wasn't a fight going on the atmosphere was pretty clean after about 150 episodes. Not Hunter x Hunter 2011 level, but still, pretty damn clean.
Sound - 10
This should be pretty freaking obvious. The OST was godly and the most openings and endings were very catchy. My favorite op's were openings 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18 and 20 and my favorite ed's were endings 1, 3, 6, 8, 25, 30, 33 and 34. Both the subbed and the dubbed versions are good, but I prefer the sub and thus recommend the sub over the dub even though the series has some of my favorite english voice actors like Travis Willingham, Crispin Freeman and Troy Baker.
My Personal Enjoyment - 9
This anime has a really special place in my heart. To me, the story was truly capturing despite being hard to follow at times and having some terrible plotholes. It had some of the best battles in most likely any shounen battle anime I've seen. It's one of the only anime that has actually managed to make me cry, and that's telling something. I truly recommend this anime for everyone who is up for the task like I was, but be prepared, this anime will have some things you might dislike.
Conclusion:
Even though I fucking love Naruto Shippuden and feel like it had a bunch of really good things going for it, Naruto Shippuden is not perfect. The story is slow, it had some bad plotholes and had a lot of flashbacking midway which made the story even slower. And these flashbacks I talked about were for the weekly watchers when the anime was aired on TV, so if you are a bingewatcher like me, this is just another minus. Despite this aspect the story is definitely worth every second of waiting for it to actually bloom. Naruto Shippuden is also obviously an anime which will not end in a shortly since it has 500 episodes, 269 if you count out the filler, holy shit, and 220 original Naruto episodes, again, counting out the filler, 126 episodes. BUT, there are fillers that are pretty important to the main story and I have gathered a notepad which has all of these filler episodes which I like to call ""Half Canon"". The original Naruto only 6 of these episodes and those were 136-141. The Naruto Shippuden ""Half Canon"" episodes were episodes 28, 45, 49, 127, 284 to 289, 316 to 319, 347 to 359, 386, 394 to 413, 416 to 417, 419, 451 to 457, 460 to 461 and 464 to 469. This show may look very scary to start because of the intense amount of episodes, the constant hate this show gets and the other negative things I have mentioned, but at the end of the day, everyone is different, everyone has different tastes and if this review didn't make you feel like watching Naruto Shippuden or Naruto at all for that matter, I guess that's just tough luck.",9
"
                Oh my God, this anime is 45% fillers (which means that it is not in the Manga), so it a waste of time. Oh even if most of the fillers is basically backstory, or side mission, I like to call them.
Yo, I am The Self-proclaimed Idiot, and that was my take on being sarcastic. In this review I will answer the hard hitting questions, for example, Do I have to watch the fillers? Is the art really $h!t, because that episode with pain face make me believe it like that all the time? Is it just me or the all shounen anime have plot armour?
                  
Story (10/10): This is an anime about a boy trying to get recognized by his peer. Oh, vague. Hard hitting question #1: No you do not need to watch the fillers, but I recommend it. You play games like Skyrim, Fallout, and Gta. And you telling you don't play the side mission. You are losing out on content or backstory when you don't watch the Fillers. This story is literally an adventure. It is also a roller coaster of emotion. You will laugh a little and cry a little. But to me that is what make an anime great.
Art (9/10): Hard hitting questions #2: Because you see what some people think is a mistake the degrade animation of its beauty. Me, a least think the art style fit beauty even the fight with Pain. 
Sound (10/10): I loved every opening and ending song. Voice acting fit every character perfectly.
Character (10/10): Every main character and antagonist had backstory (hint: watch the fillers)
Enjoyment (8/10): Did feel a little bit of slow paced, but okay.
Overall (9/10): Don't have to watch the fillers, but do. A little slow paced. Amazing song. Beautiful artwork. There might be some down sides to this anime, but you have to find them yourselves.",9
"
                Naruto is the greatest anime I have watched to date. This anime is all about tragedy and triumph. For every tragedy there is a story of triumph, a story of an underdog overcoming their short-comings and becoming the hero. These tragedies brought me tears and the triumphs inspired me to do amazing things. Never before has anything played with my emotions more than Naruto. Every character has a tragic past, but in the end they are able to overcome their past and become a hero in one way or another. If anything the soundtrack is what tugged and my heartstrings the most. The way the
                  OST was used in every situation made each episode more intense, dramatic or sad. I listen to this OST religiously and even to this day it still brings me to tears and reminds me of the hardships each character went through. I am sitting here struggling to find the words to explain how amazing this anime is but I still feel as if I am not doing Naruto any justice. The endless number of characters and jutsus still amazes me. With every episode there is something new, even the ""fillers"" that people tend to complain about. If you take the fillers seriously then you will learn things about the characters and gain a greater appreciation for them no doubt, especially the side characters. The depth that this series has is hard to grasp because of the numerous generations that this story is told over. The storyline covers centuries of shinobi and how each of their stories effects the next generation, I still have a tough time grasping this theory. Each decision made in Naruto effects the next, whether it is good or bad. Each character is likable in their own special way, even the so called ""villains"" of the show. I wish the anime/manga would never end. Naruto will always have a special place in my heart.",10
"
                Now days the anime on everyone's mind is naruto shippuden and it has deserved it. It deserves every bit of praise any one can throw at it. Set in a beautiful setting of Konoha it tells us a story about an ignored boy Naruto who claims to be the greatest ninja of the village(hokage). It maintains the perfect balance of friendship, love, suffering and loss. The writer Masashi kishimoto depicts the tale beautifully. The animation is quite good and the music is awesome. No one can not fall in love with this show. And the characters are pretty cool and powerful like Sasuke Uchiha and
                  everyone's fav. Kakashi Hatake. The main protagonist Naruto is pretty powerful but he can be annoying sometimes. His personality is like Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece(but lets face it nowadays everyone is like Luffy ex: Natsu from Fairy Tail). As of fight sequences..they are awesome and depicts how awesome it can be to be a Ninja and that is the best thing because if u can relate to it you love it.",10
"
                PLOT & STORYTELLING: The plot as a whole started out to be intriguing, very much at that. Amazing would be the ideal fashion to describe such a strong start. I still remember how well of a first arc the ""Kazekage Rescue Mission Arc"" was. But it was ""Pain's Assault Arc"" where the series peaked with a thematic value escalating the narrative to a brand new level. Absolutely zero boring canon arcs prior to that arc overall. I could feel a ""heart"" in the series. I felt confident that ""yeah boy, it really will live upto the expectations."" But unfortunately after that, the series took a
                  massive hit in its quality & went all downhill once the final major arc in ""War"" began after a fabulous buildup. The reanimation jutsu, Madara, Kaguya & what not. It felt as if the series is happening all too suddenly now without any sort of buildup or convincing plot points whatsoever. Contextualising certain scenes with flashbacks was one process I started to hate after a period of time. On top of everything, the obvious lack of a political magnitude most likely hurt the storytelling department the most in my eyes. Another thing was the whole point of the show being ignored — Naruto became Hokage, only in the OVA, not in the main series with numerous filler arcs & 500 episodes overall. That's disappointing too. And with all those annoying and some rare good filler arcs alike, the plot & storytelling in my opinion was extremely mediocre overall.
CHARACTERS: Being the centre of attention of the series, Naruto stayed true to his characteristics and grew upon well & somewhat satisfyingly, at the cost of the charm but with the addition of maturity. Though the usage of the common ""Nakama"" trope felt bit too much at times & the lack of development of a tactical aspect of Naruto was a missed potential. And of course, there were a handful of good characters present in the series like Jiraiya, Kakashi, Gaara, Pain & all but the amount of characters staying insignificant throughout the series was disappointing to think. Hinata, Nejj, Lee, Choji & more, you name it. Then there was Sakura who had a significant growth in characteristics but still felt insignificant on the larger scale. And there was this forced dynamics between Sasuke & Naruto that was preferred to be grown awkwardly ahead of the natural parallel between Gaara & Naruto or the childhood bond between Shikamaru & Naruto. The problems in handling and utilising such a massive cast was evident throughout the series & to my eyes, this is arguably the worst segment of the series.
VILLAINS: Akatsuki surely have best set of villains, or rather antagonists. The underlying depth within was always present. From Itachi to Pain, to Sasori to Madara, there were different people with different problems that were all presented well altogether. Their motive made a lot of sense too. But actual question lies within the success rate of a well written conclusion to the group or the individuals. My answer? I was disappointed. Except for Pain & Itachi (and early Akatsuki villains), the major guys couldn't live upto the bigger expectations. And Kaguya? I prefer not to speak. So all in all, villains weren't bad at all but the utilisation could've been much better. In the end, they didn't impress me therefore.
ART & DESIGNS: This is a department where Naruto Shippuden was pretty good. The new designs of Naruto, Neji, Sasuke, Pain, Madara, Deidara, Temari, Ino, Obito & many more were simply fabulous. Even if you don't like those characters, you're still bound to like their beautifully handcrafted designs. But then there are Zetsu that looked awful no matter what. So it wasn't really all too flawless but regardless, hats off to Kishimoto (and Pierrot too) for pulling off such great designs throughout the series.
ACTION & POWER-SYSTEM: The power system was swift, simplistic & did its job well. Although in Part 1, the fights were a lot more tactical. In Shippuden, however, the fights became flashier & more about overpowering. Though, that's acceptable with the fabulous choreography & animation most of the major battles had. Narratively too, a lot of battles will remain memorable forever. But what isn't acceptable for me actually is the power ceiling that was brutally broken during the War Arc. At the end of the Shippuden, there's probably not a single person on planet earth who can rival Naruto or Sasuke. Not a fan of ridiculously OP power levelling but since this particular series ended, it won't leave you a room for complaining much.
WORLD-BUILDING: The world was explored a lot more in Shippuden compared to the Part 1. World expansion was swift & well but not satisfying given the amount of proper exploration there was. I was always curious to find the lives of others in the other hidden villages. But in the end, it held no significance down the road or in the plot given most of the events took place in Hidden Leaf Village anyway. The culture, however, could've been shown on a much better level. As if every village-men are all same, only thing that differs is the place where they live. Also, politics barely had any significance of a world-building consisting a governing body. Population never had any sort of reaction even after so many wars & conflicts other than during the end of Pain's Assault Arc. Therefore, at times, the hatred towards Jinchuriki felt a bit too unrealistic. But the lores were carried out well to a certain point. But overall, world building was very mediocre.
MUSIC: This is probably the one of the two departments in my opinion in which Naruto Shippuden is nearly flawless. From the background scores to the opening/ending themes, everything was just spot on. There were a lot of memorable OPs with few of them being legendary in fact.
VOICE ACTING: I've seen entirety of the series in English dub & honestly speaking, I loved it. Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunade, Sakura, Sasuke, Gaara, Naruto & many more... The cast was just ideal & their performances were even better. Flawless really.
ANIMATION: Inconsistent. But for a weekly anime it was totally acceptable. For a weekly anime to have that many amount of well animated fights is very rare, take One Piece for example.
PACE: Consistently well in the canon arcs adaptation (if not the arcs directly) & consistently terrible in most of the filler arcs. Overall, calling it poor would be perfect. Adaptation could've been much better with Naruto being a weekly manga with no hiatus whatsoever.
MOVIES & SPECIALS: The last three movies & the Boruto movie were good to great. I enjoyed them. Prior to them, not so much. And the specials? I liked nearly all of them!
OVERALL: The first half of Shippuden & second half of Shippuden feels completely different. Quality was what being escalated every now & then in the first half with personal investment level reaching sky. But seeking moments here & there to keep the boredom out became my habit in the second half. This is all about subjectivity but unless you've seen only a few anime; or you're young and into mainstream battle shonen; or you're intriguingly obsessed with Naruto, there's no solid reason to watch Naruto Shippuden after ""Pain's Assault Arc."" Skipping the fillers is must & even then, boredom from nearly half of Shippuden is guaranteed with the terribly written War Arc. A smooth experience is something you can't really expect. But if you're young, you're in for witnessing an unforgettable journey of an oppressed underdog who lost his parents after birth due to a reason that changed the whole world in an emotional story of bonds. ""Watch-and-forget-during-the-lockdown"" is probably most ideal way to describe the mediocre show personally.",5

                If you like action packed Animes this one is for you, i myself woudlnt recommend watching naruto, only naruto shippuden, but you might want to try reading a bit about naruto to have a background of what you are about to watch.
It´s a Story about a young ninja and his path to become Hokage (Chief of his Village) and change the world for better by overcoming many obstacles through- out his life.
People might say this show has fillers, but the fillers themself tell you a story that is important, they dont feel as fillers at all, they give us the background story to understanding the
                  personalities of the characters that have appeared on this show, antagonist, protagonist, curcial and trivial throughtout the story.
My final Thoughts : If you like Action combined with a good story and some quality anime this is for you. This anime has touched my feelings in so many ways.",10
"
                this review is useful if you haven't watched Naruto already
so when you think about Naruto and Judging from it's thumbnail, here is what comes to mind:
""piece of shit Shounen people are falsely hyped about"" ""overconfident MC who never loses and  never gives up"", ""yelling makes attack stronger"" and...
unfortunately some of these accusations are true, but let me tell you this: you will enjoy this anime if you are smart
usually when someone hears that they assume this anime is sophisticated and there is a deep message with heavy symbolism, but in here this is not the case
what i mean by it is that you have
                  to recognize garbage and filler episodes BC there are a LOT of fillers in this anime, this anime with it's prequel could be summed up in 100 episode at Max.
this is what i did and honestly i could enjoy this anime because of that, look at what characters you find interesting and keep watching, for me it was ""Itachi"" and ""Sasuke"" and ""Orochimaru"" and ""Sai""
but you can find your own, there are a lot of characters with fairly interesting background, sometimes dialogues can be extremely cheesy but you gotta turn your brain off a little,
remember at the end of the day this is Shounen, it's target is teens so you can't harshly criticize this anime
besides Filler episodes there is another problem with Naruto and that's Naruto himself, his character is extremely stupid, people keep saying he has grown up and he is more mature in this one but that's totally fucking false, he is still the same highly optimistic friendship is magic love is the answer piece of shit kind of a character
Sasuke is literally killing innocent people and Naruto literally says he is my only friend even though he has a lot of frineds, Sasuke couldn't possibly be saved, near the end he starts to become schizophrenic, he literally thinks people are laughing at him and his clan, he is totally beyond saved, and honestly this makes Naruto an asshole because why is he only willing to save sasuke? why not save Orochimaru? or other villains? most of the villains are fallen heroes, nothing makes sasuke special
**spoiler**
Naruto is so annoying with his friendship crap that near the end sasuke gives the fuck up so that he leaves him alone! 
**spoiler**
i personally got interested in Naruto because of Sasuke, i saw a scene where he tried to kill one of his friend and i was curious to know what has happened to him and the show handles this character quite good, whenever sasuke is present you always want to find out what's going to happen 
and the show abuses our curiosity to prolong a decent 100 episode anime to 700 episode anime!
so to sum up, use skip button, sometimes you might have to skip 30 episode non-stop but don't be afraid and trust you instincts! THEY ARE ALL FILLERS, if it's not related to sasuke it's most likely filler
the funny thing is i would have rated this anime 1 if i have watched this anime completely!",5
"
                Naruto: Shippuden is a masterfully crafted Anime.
Plot: 
The story is absolutely beautiful. You have epic fights combined with deep emotions and unpredictable story changes that will blow your mind. The only critique I could find about the story is that in the anime some parts are described in very simple pictures, f.e. after a character pulled a very cunning move within combat, in order to let the younger audience understand what has happened. But then again I wouldn't want them to miss out on this anime just because they feel it is too complex, so I guess one can overlook this. (It doesn't happen too
                  often to be really bothering anyways.) 
Everything that happens also fits really well into the universe of Naruto, meaning that within this world's reality everything that happens makes sense. 
It is also amazing to see the different characters evolve and grow both in maturity as well as in strength. I have even caught myself cheering like a total nerd when a character has learned a new move or went over his own boundaries. However, I feel that the side characters are being neglected in terms of development, since they really can't compete with the main character's strength at all after a certain point. 
Character design:
Marvellous. There are dozens of different characters and everyone is unique. Even the side characters have distinguishable features, and the main characters show a character depth that many Hollywood movies could learn from nowadays. 
Let's take the villain Orochimaru for example. He is easily the most well-designed antagonist I have seen in any motion picture, even in all the books I read I can't find a character like him. Pure evil. Cunning, bizarre and frightening. On top of his unpredictable actions and twisted motives, the music appearing together with him just rounds up the presentation of this character, and to me, makes it unforgettable. 
Music:
It's pretty simple: The music in Naruto is incredible. When I showed some of the tracks to a friend who doesn't watch it, even she was amazed. If you don't believe me go to youtube and check some of them out, but be careful, it might lead to you watching the whole series if you haven't already! 
Animation:
They did an amazing job animating Naruto. It's really beautiful to see how everything comes to life after reading the manga in black and white, and the animation of Naruto can compete with most recent animated movies. Many scenes are animated so well that you just want to watch them over and over again, especially some of the fights where the graphics and ""camera angles"" really come to shine. 
All together, I would give it a 10/10 currently, as the overall experience with this show has simply blown me away and I can't really find anything really bad to say about it.",10
"
                This is it. The follow up to the original Naruto. I love this because it shows the young kid i got to know all grown up.
you get a special feeling after seeing a character you like progress in not only his skill but also his mentality and even art. Shippuuden also has a lot of filler but again it works, it builds to the story and is not a waste of time so do watch it, you will learn a lot and enjoy it. overall the art is good, character development is out of this world and again the music composing has a certain way
                  of hyping you up OR hit you straight in the feels man.",10
"
                The only thing this show had going for it was the Pain arc, it was a good tragedy and delivered on the promise that Naruto would one day become a strong ninja. After that, the show really falls flat.
The main problem stems from the Great War Arc being so long (equivalent to 200 chapters worth of material). Stuff is cluttered, different plot points are tangled and new major villains come out of nowhere. There are something like 4 main villains in this arc, and each one becomes irrelevant when the new one shows up. The arc builds up one antagonist and then tosses it away,
                  thereby destroying the point of the antagonist in the first place. And in the end, you're just left with a Sasuke vs. Naruto fight squeezed in for the sake of it providing closure, when in fact this fight could've just happened after the Pain arc and have had way more significance.
Aside from story shortcomings, the animation is some of the worse I've ever seen. Even Hunter X Hunter, which had around 150 episodes, had amazing animation, so I don't see long runtimes posing budget issues for the animation. There are some decent characters (Kakashi, Pain, Gai, Rock Lee, etc...) but they are few and far between, and almost every character is tossed aside so that Naruto and Sasuke can have the spotlight in the last arc. 
Overall, the show is overhyped and cliche. The 'main' antagonist Sasuke doesn't even show up a lot, and when he does he is just bland and plain edgy. The only high point of the show would be the Pain arc, since it addresses the plot point of Naruto protecting the village that shunned him and surpassing his master. This show gets a very low 4/10, and it would definitely be a 1 or 2 if the Pain arc wasn't a part of it.",4
"
                Well this review will probably butthurt the majority, if not all, of the Naruto fanbase. I liked Naruto, overall I enjoyed all aspects of it except the art which wasn't the best, I thought that Shippuuden would be equally as good, or even better. How wrong I was, it is terrible. 
Storyline - The events continue from the previous series with Naruto trying to find his friend (Sasuke) who has gone all dark and power hungry. Overall Naruto Shippuuden is an absolute nightmare, from season 1 onwards you have non-stop fillers. The amount of times the story progession gets hindered due to fillers is endless
                  and it is like this repeatedly in every season.
Art and Sound - The art is ok, but sometimes feels a bit stiff, backgrounds sound weren't best, although the music was good.
 Character - Yes there is some decent characters, but very few of the characters get any real developement. 
Enjoyment - Starts out ok, but it goes downhill fast, and eventually it gets to the point where waiting 2 hours for a bus becomes more exciting then watching this.",1
"
                My First Review Here. English is not my main language so i may have some mistakes.
First of all, the story of Naruto Shippuuden is not perfect and i give it 7 because of the fillers that were unnecessary but without them naruto would not be so popular and the memes around its fillers are amazing.There are some fillers that are good butt others are just so boring and uninteresting.
Second, The Art  I give it 6 because of Studio Perriot they fucked up a lot of the episodes with bad art and animation but instead they gave us a few rather 100+ episodes or so
                  with good art and animation like episode 322 with Madara.
Sound-8-Shippuuden has some of the best anime tracks.I think that a lot of people liked the sound/tracks of the naruto franchise.
Characters-7 Team 7 as characters developed a lot through the series.The other characters also had a major development. I like that we can see how the characters change through the series from being a kid who does only trouble to a hero and a legend and most importantly Hokage that is Naruto.
Enjoyment-9. Naruto had many amazing fights,sad scenes and funny moments but the fillers ruined a part of the story and the hype.If only the art and animation for some of the fights were better then it'd be perfect but nonetheless i liked every bit of it.
Overall-9
I will never Forget Naruto because it was a part of my life for a long time and it will be in the future.Next is Boruto I hope that it'll be as good as Naruto or better.
Believe IT! :D",8
"
                Do you like Hunter X Hunter and Full metal? Then please promtpy turn around and stay far away from the anime is shit-ru-to. 
People may tell you, ""No, it's really good"" or ""It's really entertaining"" but those same people would probably tell you ""Manbuns are cool"" or are addicted to minecraft. 
Watching this anime is like smoking cigarettes. I really wish I could quit, and they're terrible for me, and I can't smoke in public and it isn't as cool as I thought it was going to be, but fuck I just can't stop. I wish I had a nicotine patch for Naruto. A Naruto
                  patch if you will. 
Let me break it down for you in a step by step. 
First start smoking: The beginning
Yea, all your friends do it, and it looks cool, and that guy from the walking dead smokes and bitches love him right? Well yea, the show is pretty good when it starts off as far as plot goes. You think the plot is really cool, and it is. It's like a mustang gt shelby. You know you like Nissan GTR's more, and you know they are better cars, but there's nothing quite like a mustang. So you watch it, and you keep watching it, and you enjoy it. The effects haven't caught up to you yet. You're enjoying it. The animation is good, great even, and boy the fight scenes and new characters are fucking cool! I mean, deidara and sasori? These akatsuki are badass. oh & look there's itachi, and oh boy, sasuke is back! woah, naruto learns a new power? Woah, demon fights! The animation is kicking ass, the music soundtrack if fucking prime well known and skilled artists and the theme music is pretty good man. Full sails, and you're off. 
a year of smoking- The middle
Okay, it's really not that cool anymore. People have started to tell you you're teeth are getting yellow, and your skin isn't as clear. Oh, and you always smell. And you can't smoke in your car, or in restaurants, and you gotta get up to go smoke and that pisses you off because you're friends are talking shit on you. That's now naruto. You're like, okay, the anime quality has gone down. The art is a bit doofy now, and the animation budget? Did you guys lose a lawsuit? Then there's the fillers. You're like, okay, I guess that one was okay but now this is the 5th one in like 60 episodes, wtf? Then the plot goes way off track and you're like, okay, well I guess it will just get better. So you keep smoking, and say ""fuck all those people. I'll just hang out with smokers from now on"". 
2 years of smoking- The end
Now you always reek, you can't hang around your nephew, and all your new friends are white trash and smoke newports, and you only smoke camels. You've given up hope, and the doctor says you need to cut back or else. Naruto is now garbage, and you know it is you piece of shit. The animation is laggier than a 1 legged prostitute, and the artwork has been handed over to 12th graders in a graphic design class from somewhere in Upstate Newyork. The plot is now on a different planet, and there's no fucking life there. Good luck finding water fuckhead. Now all your hope is in the music, the only good thing left, and in the remaining characters, which have dwindled down to a small ewok army on the shitty planet that is endor. You don't even enjoy it anymore, you just want it to end. You'll try quitting, but you remember the mange had cool fights and there was that one fight you wanted to see, so you're right back on it, smoking it up. Every episode is a cancer you wish would just explode. You pray for the end of the series with fierce determination that rivals that of a born again christian. 
Conclusion?
I plead dear would be viewers. Don't you fucking dare watch this show. I don't care what your best friend said. Fuck him, he probably watches kill la kill and thinks it's really good and unique.",6
"
                Naruto Shippuuden takes a nice shit on the Naruto series. Even if you take away all the filler, the core material completely eradicates the main message of the original series. Naruto was supposed to be about a child who was not gifted and he attempt to follow his impossible dream. But Shipuuden takes the typical shonen route and makes the story about a chosen boy who must save the world. This is not a good series, most characters are back seated for Naruto, and though it has its good moments, the series took a huge nose dive. The story follows the end of Naruto, and
                  now Naruto wants to save Sasuke and defeat the Akatsuki, while the Akatsuki look interesting at first, the story starts to unravel into a huge ""this was all apart of my plan!"" type theme. Where the evil genius keeps being trumped by another evil genius. Naruto's character changes for the worst, sakura looks as if she is going to become an actual decent character but that is shit on. Kakashi is decent along with shikamaru but eventually every character becomes a narutard, also known as a character that falls in love with naruto and just spouts out naruto like messages, this turns their characters into naruto clones. The villains were interesting, and they would be good if the series stopped using the whole ""He was just like Naruto, except he could not be happy"" type theme, it became an in series cliche. The art was eh at many moments, yet the music was good. So I was NOT look at this series, instead if you want some shonen in your life go READ one piece, as the anime has become visual garbage. also soul eater should take care of your anime fighting craving, and it is short as well.",3
"
                       The obvious complaint is probably clear for anyone who has seen the show: filler. Good lord, there is a lot. At first I was fine with it, because it was the first anime I watched, and I watched a lot. Before I found Crunchyroll, I would google _________ vs _________ and watch the fight scenes, which would be 90 minutes long and 20 minutes of actual combat. But again, I was fine with that, even when I started to watch the series in order.
      Then I branched out to other anime that I
                  saw on tumblr: Attack on Titan, Fairy Tail, and KnK to name a few. I was FLOORED the first time I watched AoT because of how much story they crammed into each episode. One episode of AoT was equal to seven episodes of Naruto. It's not even for story purposes; half of the Naruto filler is people glaring angrily at each other from across the battlefield. Plus, do you really want to watch seven episodes of the main character trying to rip a leaf for training?
      Another thing that I was not a fan of in Naruto was the amount of dues ex machinima they used during the battles. Just when a character seemed totally screwed, he would suddenly unveil a secret Jutsu that he/she cast twenty minutes before. It was like the writers put themselves in a corner every battle and had to create a miracle to save the plot. 
      The soundtrack is amazing though, and it can give one goosebumps. The art is good, with sweeping landscaped and the collateral damage from the battles would show, which I thought showed a good attention to detail. Some characters you'll hate, others you'll love, and that's a good thing. The character development is nice, although the pacing can be shotty sometimes, and characters may disappear for weeks in-show.
       While this is a cornerstone in the anime world, and I do enjoy it a lot and would recommend it, I have to say there are substantially better animes out there. One good thing is that this show is not terribly far behind the manga, but that also is the cause of all the filler. Maybe, if this series was 150 episodes instead of 345 (as of this review), which would've been very doable, I would give this a 10.",6
"
                Imagine yourself inclined on how astounding an episode is, enthralled by the unanticipated twists and exciting battles each episode has to offer, then suddenly, the next thing you know; you'll be watching filler episodes back-to-back that matters not in the plot. The absurd amounts of fillers present in this anime destroyed my experience and annoyed me the most, thus forcing myself to write this spiteful introduction towards Naruto Shippuuden. I can spout more insults that I found ridiculous towards this piece of crap...that's if I didn't enjoy and loved Naruto Shippuuden as an avid anime fan.
The endless amounts of fillers that I've grown to hate
                  were outweighed by the existence of countless amazing things that I've loved about this series, and that, in fact, is why I give this anime a 9/10. 
I remember buying copies of pirated DVD's in my country just to watch a bundle of episodes of Naruto, which was way back in 2012, and as a child, plot didn't really matter at most. Just the fact that I was able to enjoy and mimic the way the characters act and talk was a good reason for me to love this show. Now that I'm a 17-year old teenager that loves to write his opinions on the Internet, rewatching the whole series itself made it clear that this show I've adored when I was a kid, was still the same show that I've admired.
I'll try to be conscious of spilling spoilers, so don't worry about seeing any relevant info that may destroy your experience. I'm just here to give you an insight on the things you'd expect from this show.
The plot follows the story of your typical shonen protagonist, Naruto. Shunned by the villagers because of his nature, his adventure to be acknowledged by the people is a tale of loss and hope that will keep you buckled into your seats. The lore behind the world of shinobi is further explained in the middle part of the series, and it's something that I was able to absorb due to the power of Kishimoto to connect episodes I've seen to a history that led to the current situation. 
Though the plot wouldn't be pretty much interesting if it weren't for the many memorable characters that appeared on this series, that truly brought forth this series towards its success. Aside from Naruto, the appearance of many great side characters with their past being emphasized in the fillers were interesting enough to keep me hooked to this show. There are so much life lessons that I've learned from them, enough to empathize with them in tragic times. Supporting characters, antagonists, even characters that appeared for only one episode, most of them have unique personalities that keeps the show going. Sure I disliked the fillers, but SOME fillers presented character depth that made my attachment toward the characters stronger, which is why I'm not 100% spiteful towards the fillers.
(You've probably seen some memes saying Sakura is useless - yes she is, but at the same time, she does her job)
The animation quality is I'd say...inconsistent. Some episodes were simply horrid and the characters looked like drawings made by drunken artists, and I'm referring to the fillers and unimportant ones. The main episodes, HOWEVER, were just breathtaking especially the fight scenes and 1 v 1 battles. Including the choreography and details in the animation part, there's a strong impact that only Naruto can deliver when it comes to animation. In terms of battles, the animation is fluid and detailed when I'd watched it slowly. Seeing even the slight movements of arms and being overwhelmed by how well-choreographed the fight scenes were, in addition to the perfect placement of flashbacks and gripping soundtracks, so much emotion can be conveyed and felt as I've immersed myself in what's in front of me. Even airing back on 2007 - 2015, the amount of effort and budget that the developers put in animating the main episodes can be truly noticed. 
I have nothing to say about the music. SERIOUSLY. With heartfelt and pumping openings such as the infamous Silhouette and melancholic endings, my playlist is filled with songs I've found in the series. The original soundtracks are also worth praising for. Naruto's energizing main theme; Sasuke's Wild West theme, even Itachi's comforting theme - there's so much more OST's Naruto has to offer that complements scenes very well and further strengthens the impact in which a scene can deliver.
Voice acting is exceptional too.
To end this review, I'd just like to clarify things to convince you further to watch this show and choose which path to take.
I've first started to watch Naruto up to Naruto Shippuuden without missing one episode and trust me, there'll be times you'll get bored as hell especially if you're the ones who manages his/her time, so I'd suggest you to search online what are the episodes that truly matters the most and the fillers that are worth noticing if you are someone who doesn't have all-time in your grasp. I simply rewatched Naruto while having a cheat code of which episodes to watch since I'm now a college student and I've simply wanted to make a genuine feedback on the anime I've loved ever since. Still, partaking in the 800 episodes without missing a single isn't also a bad idea. It develops character depth that enhanced my attachment towards 'some characters that made them truly memorable.
So no matter how many things I found ridiculous in the hundreds of hours I've allotted in watching Naruto, I've enjoyed it genuinely. Kishimoto successfully implanted his life lessons toward myself and I don't regret any bit of it. Hearing the same word ""Hokage Dattebayo"" which means ""I'm gonna be Hokage"" millions of times is quite a nuisance, but I've realized the meaning behind it. The resolve of the characters towards their goal is what I've truly grown fond of, and this resolve was enough for me to keep involving myself in this anime, no matter what others say. 
Sure Naruto is no masterpiece; it's like I said in the first part - it's a piece of crap. But this crap is interesting enough that it left a place in my heart and convinced myself to watch the 800 episodes this title has to offer and complete all the game adaptations. Oddly enough, I found myself attached to people that doesn't even exist. I even cried without realizing the reason behind it. I don't really know it myself, but as long as anime made me shed a tear, it's worthy enough to be praised.
And thus a strong wind was able to sway one's heart.",9
"
                I never actually finish the whole series but I stopped watching at a point sometime before the war where there were a majority of fillers along the way.
And then I heard it just finished so I just watched the last episode.
Well the Naruto arc has finally come to an end one of the most popular shonen anime. It has some good & bad parts towards this anime. Hinata looking bae at their wedding though.
I'm pretty sure most people don't like it for fillers and some just bear with it and kept going so I give it a 7 overall.
              ",7
"
                Naruto Shippuuden is like Star Wars the Disney Sequels - a whole lot of retconning, fan service and bull crap. It's one of those anime continuations or endings that were better off not happening at all. The problem is the story, not the anime, the animation quality or manga, the story is the main culprit.
As it continues off from how Naruto ended, the story starts off full of hope, energy, a lot of new adventures, but just like One Piece Post Time Skip, it just should have not existed at all. Just to see the story ending and the price being the whole story turn
                  into garbage is a price way too high for anyone to pay.
The way the story goes in Shippuuden and how it is explained the origin of Ninjutsu is also too far-fetched and not a satisfying conclusion. There is a lot of going back and forth in the series, a lot of nothing happening for hundreds of episodes, meaning literally years passing with nothing of significance happening. Then there are a lot of useless side-characters from other ninja villages being introduced, each one gets their own flashback to explain their motivation, again wasting at least 30-40 episodes for absolutely no reason.
A lot of the time is Naruto acting all strong and mature and Sasuke playing emo once again with some new followers buying his crap. At the end there is a great culmination, combined with dead characters being brought to life and useless characters being killed off like Portgas D. Ace in One Piece just to create a fake feeling of how dark and serious stuff are (which isn't the case), then comes the ending filled with even more retconning and fan service and the series ends. 
I was glad when it ended, not because I was happy with how it ended, but with the fact that it's over, so I don't have to put up with this trash ever again. The original Naruto series is far superior and it should have never been continued into Shippuuden if it was going to be the garbage it was. This is further emphasized in the series Boruto, which is literally 70% fan service and 30% riding on the old story's fame hoping to keep this garbage afloat. After that I won't be surprised if there is a series about Boruto's grandchildren, and some people will even watch that too.",4
"
                A seriously disappointing sequel to the original. 
How do people find this story inspiring? The only thing I learned from this extremely predictable story is the importance of god-given gifts in determining your fate. Naruto is like- the ninja equivalent of a trust fund kid. His daddy sealed the nine tails inside of him knowing it would give him access to all the best jutsus, the biggest chakra reserves, etc. It gets hard to sympathize with Naruto after the Pain Arc. 
 If you want a more believable underdog story, watch Black Clover. 
I know the war arc wasn't originally intended to be a part
                  of the series. It is SO OBVIOUS that an entire third of the Shipudden runtime is just a giant cash grab. No hate to Kishi. Shounen Jump and publishing schedules are brutal. What happened in the manga can't be changed, but it seriously undermines the quality of the story. 
The issue with female characters is also magnified tenfold during the war arc. Sakura had so much potential to perform more feats on screen. I hate to see her getting crap from shounentards when her medical skills are leagues above Naruto and Sasuke. Seeing her being outdone by Six Paths Naruto who just woke up with the ability to restore AN ENTIRE EYEBALL at will was just a huge middle finger to her years of training under Tsunade.
Seriously. God-given talent. Kabuto was right when he imitated Orochimaru. For the talentless, our only hope is to harness the talents of others. Not the message I watched Naruto for, but it is the message I got.",5
"
                 Most people forget what Naruto is and what it is meant to be and start comparing it with anime that arrived a decade later. And it's almost impossible to assign numbers and evaluate a series like this one that has been running over a decade. Naruto was never a show made to compete with mind boggling story such as... I don't know let's say Cowboy Bebop for a lack of better example. But it was made in midst of a shounen revolution where the importance was placed on Friendship, goodness, and perseverance. 
Naruto is very little about ninjas. In fact it's very bad at
                  portraying what ninjas are. But Naruto is creative at least. Taking this ninja genre and combining it into several martial and weapon arts to make this very unique show. Well unique is a bit subjective but whatever. I applaud the series for combining the natural elements, weapons, and even mixing human behaviors to create a world full of unique fighting techniques. 
Story wise, Naruto is about the character Naruto becoming the leader of his village. He is an orphan cursed with bearing a monster with him and the whole anime is about him overcoming the world of ninjas, which is filled with hatred and suspicion. See the series have some of the most fascinating characters. Each of them with their own background, although many of them could've been kept a secret for the better story progression and pacing. Many of these characters' actions are justified by their past and as the series progresses you can see how each of them changes and influences each other. However the best aspect of the series is also probably the worst aspect of it. While many main characters are given a good amount of attention and care and many of them are nurtured with logic, others just become fodder characters uttering 1 or 2 lines then their worth are never revisited again. 
The story of Naruto is about never giving up, making friends, and well, whatever standard shounens babble about. But Naruto is one of the few exceptions because Naruto is rarely a hypocrite and actually always stays around its core beliefs. As the series is ending, it's sad that many of the traits of the characters like Sasuke and Obito are reversing and villains are entering the infamous Dragon Ball complex (you enemy becomes bff lol), the main thing is Naruto remains Naruto: stupid and somehow still influential. 
After watching this series at different intervals and after watching other anime, I came to appreciate Naruto. Because I watched several long running shounen and nothing really even came close to the emotional appeal Naruto formed. I think I can safely say that this show truly keeps it promise and shows Naruto is a hardworking guy who becomes special. 
However, I still can't forgive this series for wasting the potential of so many characters, random power-ups, unnecessary glorification of Sasuke and Naruto (WE GET IT THEY'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS) and Bleach-esque arse pulls. The fillers are downright horrible and let's not even explore the comedy. Seriously, many of the plot like Kaguya and other backstory could have been omitted, no they should have been omitted, to give Naruto a more refined ending but it is what it is. 
At the end of the day, Naruto is a good series about a guy never giving up as he faces challenge to save his friend and save his village. Indeed it is a tale of a gutsy ninja. Characters like Itachi, Jiraiya, and Pain are some of the noteworthy characters in all of anime. Naruto is a good series on what it stands for. Stop comparing it to high level, 13 episode series because all anime loses its lust after 500 episode mark. 
On a side note, this is not a proper review. Just whatever I feel about this series. I recommend it for the nostalgia and some really good fight scenes.",7
"
                Now I know you might be surprised of my score since Naruto Shippuden seems it had gone through a lot of hate lately mostly because of the filler episodes however, it didn't seem to bother me that much. Sure, there are some fillers from a few episodes ago but it will be until episode 100 after they stop with the ""overwhelming"" amount of fillers in each episode.
---
Story:
The story is about the same Naruto we knew from the main series however, now that he is more mature he will get over following Sasuke all the time and focus on training to become a hokage (P.S. I
                  was just joking, the whole plot now focuses on this whole part).
Leaving the jokes aside, although the story focuses on Sasuke throughout the whole series, like OnePiece, it shows how hard it is to achieve something you want after you see how much you have to go in order to accomplishing it. 
Art: As you *may know*, long running series start off with lower graphics and then grow in quality by a lot although the graphics it started off didn't bother me at all, It's just the way they try to covering things to save more budget is really bad. No further comments there. (8/10)
Sound: Surprisingly enough, I just love the Naruto Shippuden soundtracks since I am a big fan of Japanese instrumental songs, However! It could get really annoying as it gets overused as many other long running series do the same thing to safe money which is understandable, but I didn't feel like they were as good as in the main series, remember those sad soundtracks which really gave you the vibes when they started? Well, none of these here which was really my main disappointment. (7/10)
Character: If there's something Naruto Shippuden has improved in from the main series, it would be the animation and characters. The characters have evolved a lot in mental as well as physical strength (ex: Shikamaru) which also made the Naruto series somewhat more *mature*. 
Enjoyment: Too lazy to continue so ==> (8/10)
Overall:
In conclusion the story is pretty good executed although there are bits missing here and there.
Hope you enjoyed my boring review.",8
"
                Above all, anime is a journey. Each different show carries its own distinct narrative fueled by a cast of characters residing in a setting; one thing that separates anime from the majority of mainstream Western television is this fact, that this industry of Japan puts in the effort and grunt work to adapt manga and novels and light novels and video games and create its own original work that follows a continuous story that’s not episodic. Now there are plenty of episodic anime like Cowboy Bebop and Mushishi; but for the most part, this medium is known for running multi-episode stories on television. Shows like
                  One Piece, Dragon Ball, and Naruto that air for 10+ years are rare west of Japan, and for obvious reasons. Such commitment requires significant amounts of money, time, and human capital.
The longer a journey goes, the more you grow to love the characters, obviously. One immensely popular show that’s by all rights really good, Game of Thrones, in Western television has aired for seven seasons so far since 2011. And that’s enough time, plus the time progression within the story, to cherish certain characters as they’ve grown throughout. I’ll name Arya Stark as a prime example.
I mentioned Naruto earlier. This amazing anime aired from 2002 to 2017 for a total of 126 (Naruto) + 262 (Naruto: Shippuuden) = 388 episodes or approximately 142 hours, or 6 days, and that’s not counting filler. That’s also not counting Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, which may also be quite long. Compare this to Game of Thrones, which takes up 2 days. If we’ve been able to grow to adore certain characters in Game of Thrones after 2 days, then all the more so for Naruto, wouldn’t you think?
But I digress. My point is, that regardless of the various flaws in Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden, it’s worth watching to go through this journey and see Naruto’s way of Ninja. You must consider Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden together as one cohesive whole; although the latter is significantly more mature and improved on many points. Flashbacks are crucial to the characters’ development in Naruto; in the same way, when you look back to little annoying Naruto in the first episodes, and compare him back then to who he is now as (spoiler alert, but we all knew it was coming) Hokage, like seven hells, the growth is stunning. One of Naruto’s strong aspects, if not its strongest aspect, is its characters. Not only are they well fleshed out for the most part, but the way they interact and display their emotions, especially when amassed over 15 years, make them realistic in a way that One Piece and Bleach aren’t able to convey. It’s difficult to describe each of them with one word; right now I was going to write something like “Shikamaru’s nonchalance, Sakura’s kindness”, but then realized the futility. It would do these shinobi injustice to describe them thus; as two-dimensional they are on the screen, they’re completely three-dimensional to my heart. The main characters in particular -- Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno -- these three are just… human.
I could end this review right here. I could say that the journey itself with these ninja is worth alone. But I won’t, because the Naruto universe presented through the anime has so much more to give you. From now on, I’ll be focusing on Naruto: Shippuuden, which let me tell you again, is much better than Naruto. So when you watch Naruto and aren’t too intrigued by the no. 1 most unpredictable ninja, keep in mind that this is just a prequel, an extended prologue, to the true story that lies in Naruto: Shippuuden.
I’ll start with the soundtrack. Yeah, it was kind of annoying, those tribal-esque war cries in Naruto, that played whenever Naruto would bust out a new technique. But Shippuuden brings you an intense score of Star Wars Duel of the Fates-esque dark choral majesty to back certain antagonists that are SO BADASS. They’re so cool that I actually didn’t want them to lose. The way they talked with each other, showing their cold personalities supported by crazy strength, oh my I really liked those guys and once the story moved on the show actually lost some of its dark hue that had made it so appealing.
And this is what really distinguishes Shippuuden from its counterparts like One Piece, Bleach, Fairy Tail, etc. The main villains are easy to empathize with. They have legitimate reasons for doing what they do. They’re not even evil to the sense of the word, they’re just trying to enforce peace in a war-torn world in their own revolutionary way. Again, this is a story in which I actually sided with the bad guys more than the good guys.
But that’s just one side of the coin gilded by the Muses. Shippuuden is high-octane wicked cool at times, but also deeply emotional at others. The soundtrack is also wonderfully beautiful and heartrending, for there are plenty of emotive moments. You can view the entirety of Shippuuden as a plot of salvation. Naruto, who possesses a power similar to Monkey D. Luffy that enables him to befriend enemies and change the hearts of those he meets, commits himself to saving a certain other character at the onset of Shippuuden. His almost blind devotion to this task, coupled with his lesser intelligence and sheer stubbornness, aren’t exactly desired traits but his willingness to believe and keep on striving, no matter the circumstances, make them meritable.
I’ll now discuss plot armor. This narrative-prevalent device is so endemic to shounen that it’s practically getting on my nerves. (Bleach, I’m talking to you.) Yeah we don’t want the good guys to die, but in real life it doesn’t make sense for like all the good guys to survive and all the bad guys to die. If you want to make the gravity of the conflict greater, then even some good guys should die. It’s not like the good guys were stronger than the bad guys at the start. Heck, more often than not the bad guys are much stronger.
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a good example of a shounen in which good guys do die, and the main characters don’t always win their battles. Shingeki no Kyojin, although protecting the main characters extremely well, does kill off many supporting characters. One Piece, on the other hand, doesn’t even kill off the bad guys except all of those marine grunts that fell off the ships. The bosses are just soundly knocked out cold and wounded, but that’s it, they’re still alive.
Shippuuden does protect many of its good guys, but several pretty important ones do get killed, and each time the death carries a weight that resonates long afterwards. What’s more, being a world of shinobi who usually fight to the death, the loser does die (usually). There is that part of a certain jutsu that severely redefines plot armor, or should I say, plot reanimation, but that’s essential to a certain extensive arc so I guess it’s okay but I’m still not too sure about it.
Now let’s discuss the art. The improvement from Naruto, which was kind of hazy and reminiscent of classics like Evangelion, to Shippuuden, which has pleased me with its palette of gentle and warm colors, is legitimately aesthetic. I’ll even dare to say, that at certain moments, it rivals the plethora of modern 1- and 2-cour anime that are well drawn and styled. Towards the end I discerned another shift upwards in the quality, although by that time the characters’ faces became even more sharply defined, like what you see in anime produced by ufotable. I’ll also mention that for certain fights Studio Pierrot lowered the quality, but that’s OK, the fights are so fluid and berserk that it doesn’t really make a difference, and it actually makes it look more artistic.
Speaking of fights… damn. The fights in Shippuuden are some of the best I’ve seen in anime. That last fight in particular. Much of it is hand-to-hand, and watching shinobi battle it out, kicking, punching, putting hands together for some jutsu, summoning creatures, manipulating the elements, manipulating the laws of physics, it’s insane. They’re not quite as realistic as those in Gintama, nor as visually alluring as those in multiple ufotable works, but they’re certainly a sight to witness.
And lastly, I”ll mention the plot. Many have criticized the flow of antagonists up the climax of Shippuuden, especially how they were connected. The way I see it, the fact that Antagonist A was related to Antagonist B who was related to Antagonist C isn’t necessarily cause for complaint, but rather, cause for acknowledgement. Well, at least I personally like it when something the viewer suspects to be fact is in truth something deeper. The last conflict is somewhat stretched, though, looking back on it, but as we’ve seen since the beginning, a fight between shinobi isn’t as simple as stronger beats weaker; strategic use of jutsu and deception is as natural to shinobi combat as making webs is for spiders. That’s just how they do it, so as a matter of course any battle between strong characters is bound to last for some time.
Just kidding, I forgot to mention the filler. I really don’t like how this is the #1 cause of complaint for many people. Yes, it is the studio’s fault for creating so many filler episodes that plague the viewer’s experience each week. But you have to understand, people. The medium of anime is not like the medium of novels. Books are completed before publication, their stories finished. Anime are by no means finished, as each week a new episode that only furthers the plot incrementally is aired; furthermore, each episode is the culmination of many hours and days of grueling, collaborative work among many people, each contributing a different part from the music to the storyboards to the animation to the production aspects and so on. Watch Shirobako for more detail. What’s more, the anime industry is heavily pulled back by meager budgets. Before being adapted into anime, manga have to meet certain standards of popularity before studios feel like it’s worth spending the time and money hoping to make a profit out of a 1- or 2-cour or multi-season anime. Animators especially aren’t paid very much for the immense amount of work they put in. And the fact that anime that are based on manga, which are also being serialized on a regular basis, only leads to filler as well. If the anime in terms of storyline has met where the manga is, there’s obviously not enough material to adapt, and since the anime doesn’t want to bereave its fans, it resorts to unrelated filler to kill time. Also filler and/or recap episodes serve as backup for when the studio falls behind its deadlines, as they’re much easier to make.
So let me make this clear. Having filler, even lots of filler, doesn’t detract from the quality of the show itself. That’s a mere technicality. Obviously if the industry were better funded and its employees paid more, we would see less of filler. If Shippuuden didn’t have any filler, I can guarantee that its general conception would be significantly higher. Moreover, in today’s age of services like blessed Crunchyroll, you can skip the damned filler as easily as Itachi throwing kunai at targets.
Who cares about the length. Yeah you’re busy (I’m in college) and Naruto is crazy long and it looks like it may never end with this new show called Boruto. That’s original, isn’t it. The more episodes, the merrier. The more to enjoy this fulfilling journey with Naruto Uzumaki, the shounen who dreams of becoming Hokage and showing the world his unique way of Ninja.",10

                SPOILER FREE
Shippuden has a GREAT story, but show is garbage because of it's annoying fillers. When the story is really is pacing they meddle with a unrelated episode. So annoying that at some point you will definitely will feel to drop the show. That's why show is hanging in 8 pointer score. 
BUT if you insist only to root for story and for some characters you will love the show.
Story is really twisted, vast and connecting but pacing is slow. They really have great fights really.
Some characters are so great that make a great impression. Like Itachi, Madara (you will definitely this guy)
Some character will
                  make you puke. Like Sakura or sakura or else sakura.
It's a anime worth giving a shot. I only gave this anime decent rating because of story and some great characters.
Last thought: Everybody can enjoy this story.
If you enjoy this then don't even try to watch ""Boruto"", yeah, like seriously even if you have time  that story which took naruto setting for granted and ruined it will only make your day bad. Like seriously don't watch boruto.",9

well above is the review of me as a child & what Naruto franchise is to its targeted viewer it's never meant for a grown-up or adult.
but if still as I have grown I think its a FLAWED-MASTER-PIECE.
Neji's story is criminally written his character could provide way more story & thrill his death is cheaply written it
                  would have been way better to watch how he became 1st leader from a branch family & proving himself greatest.
Madara realizing his mistakes by Hasirama & TOBIRAMA conversation with him after Naruto & Sasuke defeats him in a more exploring(where their new powers are more exhibited, explaining YIN-YANG RASEN-SHURIKEN & INDRA-ARROW) battle, would be much better.
BUT THE LEGEND OF ITACHI UCHIHA HIS DEAPTHNESS GREATNESS MAGNIFICENCE is EXCLUSIVE & GODLY.
SAME GOES FOR HOW THE VILLANS ARE ALL SELFLESS Naruto's VILLANS ARE NOT MONSTERS THEY ARE JUST WRONGED DRIFTED SOULS WAITING TO BE SAVED & FREED FROM THE ""CHAIN OF HATRED"". (unlike ambitious greedy monsters they are selfless souls want others to live in peace but their piece is wronged & twisted)
and so on this master-piece has so much wasted potential, but for a kid, it is a GLORIOUS JEWEL.

"
                Let me start off this review by saying the Naruto series is my favorite series of all time, I absolutely love it but I'm going to do my best to review this fairly with a leveled mind.
Let's start off with the story the base story is amazing it's honestly a work of art. The key word in that sentence was a base story unfortunately, corporate greed ruined it. The studio that makes Naruto (Studio Pierrot) released an episode of Naruto every time a chapter of naruto was release. The problem with this is Naruto episodes contain multiple chapters of the manga so naturally, the manga
                  artists couldn't keep up, therefore leaving us with filler. I think that there is a filler that you can like but there is so much filler that they can't make sequels to them so they just leave us with crap. I strongly believe that once you get past the filler the main storyline more than makes up for it.
The next is the art, corporate greed also put a damper on how good this could have been. Studio Pierrot is known for only saving their amazing animations till a big fight/scene (ex. Tokyo Ghoul) so besides this one point, the art is very reasonable.
Another thing I absolutely love about Naruto is the intros and outros, they are each amazing in every single way and I would watch Naruto over again solely for the intros.
Finally the characters/character development. I love all the characters so much and I think the writer did an amazing job creating them, I even think temporary characters (Characters we see in filler/side characters). That being said Character development is a completely different story. Besides characters like Naruto, Sasuke, and maybe Rock Lee, each character gets an arc where you learn a bit about them and then they become basically irrelevant for the rest of the show if they don't die. They could have made Naruto a lot better if they tried replacing some of the filler with either more character development for side characters/main characters or if they made sequels to their fillers.",10
"
                Every so often, something comes along that is truly special. Naruto: Shippuuden is one of those very special moments in any type of media that there is nothing wrong with it. Everything in this anime screams masterpiece from the master story-telling to the relatable and down-to earth characters. If you think that the sheer length of the anime is a turn-off, think again, as every minute is worthwhile. One of the main criticisms of Shippuuden is the number of filler episodes which is a criticism I disagree with due to my opinion of every episode being integral to the plot as it shows the main
                  character's lighter side. If you haven't seen the whole of Shippuuden, why are you on this site? You are not a true anime fan.
Note: A messy haired boy in my class did not understand the complexity of Naruto: Shippuden so I battered him as it was a insult to this masterpiece.",10

                Naruto Shippuden is honestly the BEST anime, I have ever watched. The story is freaking amazing. I didn't think that I would actually watch english subs but I loved the story sooo much that I couldn't just stop. I am on episode 396, well I finished it, but I am waiting for episode 397 & for the movie to come out. I recommend Naruto Shippuden to everyone!!!

                who ever says naruto is a kids TV show is completely wrong.
naruto: shippuden is much better than the original series (even though the original was still very good) as it much more serious which is good and bad. The story is amazing because it is so different to any other anime I've watched and I love all of the characters because they are original and are all well build up and they all have great personalities. It is so gripping I found myself thinking about it all the time and I could not stop watching it will I was catching up to the latest episode.
People
                  say that is ""all filler"" and boring but I would rather the story be slow paced and have actual canon content most of the time than a few fast paced episodes and then fillers all the time throughout. Even though it is slow paced in places it still good and they make it good even though it's kind of slow. 
Seriously, it is my favorite anime ever just because of the great story, so many lovable characters, great battle music, and because it has made my want to be a konoha shinobi! :(",10
"
                Just over one year after starting the original Naruto series, I have gotten through all 770 episodes. Although I did not get to experience it in the way many others did by growing up with it through the many years of its airing, in a way I lucked out because I did not have to spend months watching weekly fillers. I personally believe reviews/ratings by people who watch a show later after it has aired are a lot more reliable than ones that are given immediately after a show finishes airing. Peoples expectations and bias towards a show often cloud the reliability of a seasonal
                  show's rating, especially when its a preliminary rating (no idea why people rate shows before completing them).
But thats beside the point. Naruto is arguable one of the most entertaining series not just in anime, but in entertainment ever. Its ability to captivate an audience and blow them away was put on display numerous times. Whether it was the opening arc of the Land of Waves, the Chunin Exam, or Pains Arc, it told its story in such an interesting and fun way. Even though Naruto isnt exactly known for its complex plot or characters, theres really no anime that comes close to it in excitement. 
Fillers suck, yea we get it, try to go a day without complaining about the Naruto fillers challenge (most of you would fail). Naruto Shippuden has some quality filler arcs compared to the original series, particularly towards the last half of the show. Great filler arcs that come to mind are the Kakashi, Itachi, and Kaguya background ones. If people would look at filler as extra content instead of waste of time, then they would be able to enjoy it a lot more. Its like DLC!!!
Damn... the characters in Naruto Shippuden... are something else. Pretty much every main Uchiha character is awesome, along with Team 7, the Kage, and some of the Konan kids. Naruto's character is the highlight of well, the Naruto series. His character isnt exactly complex. He doesnt go through much character ""development"" per say. But watching his story, and his dream, play out its hard to put into words the feelings you get from that. Hes such a bright, uplifting character and it makes viewers so happy to see everyone around him not only acknowledge him, but follow behind him as their leader. 
Focusing on the bright side of an anime series is what people in this community should always do. You can critique Naruto for its many filler arcs, or for not putting lots of effort into animation. But the show is still the most popular and impactful anime of all time for a reason. It has that IT factor that makes people of all ages want to watch it. No other show will ever be able to do what the Naruto franchise has done, and hopefully nobody tries. The thrill and hype moments Naruto brings are forever cementing in Anime history.",9
"
                I can't blame you guys who didn't like this anime because of fillers and the likes. But i admit, I am one of the so called Narutards who manages to like this series more and more because for me, this is one of the best anime I ever watched.
STORY - 9
I know many of you are sick of this ""guy chasing a guy"" thing and I am getting tired of it too that is why i gave a 9 for the story. Having this stated, I am giving appreciation to the story's complexity as it gives an amazing twist and and revelation as the story
                  goes. As they say, this is a continuation of ""returning sasuke back"" arc which made this Shippuden's main goal is to return/save sasuke than Naruto being a hokage and that irritated me but then again, i don't give too much attention to this story, instead, i give importance to what the story stands right now.
ART and SOUND - 8
I'm not that choosy when it comes to art as long as their is a projection of image and proper representation of what should be done and executed. But with the sound, I liked the sound tracks from the previous Naruto because of its uniqueness that made me feel the reality of each event. The liked the OPs more the EDs. EDs did not struck me that's why i listen to OPs that made me say Sha La La.
CHARACTER - 8
I don't want to give any comment for each character present as all of them really have their own progress as the series moves forward but what i can say is that, Naruto and Sasuke are the most I*&w3*9 ever!!! i don't know why naruto stills wants to have sasuke back. did they have intimate moments with each other privately? (O_o) how can you consider someone a friend if he himself doesn't want to return and to be with you. And this sasuke is such an ugly dick who wants his armpits licked!
OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9
it may look contradicting from what i have said above but those are just individual thoughts that bugged me off personally and these won't affect my overall experience in watching this anime. since for me, the story is great but not perfect and the way it gives the twist and revelation makes me want to watch the next episode (not the filler though). And still, i am looking forward for a greater arc and will forever be a fan of Naruto.",9

                Naruto is the most amazing anime ever, I didn't regret watching it,  really interesting and every episode makes me excited to continue watching and go on to find out what's gonna happen 😃😃. The fights are really amazing and you can feel your own heart beats when you watch it, and feel so excited and want to join them 😂😂 ""that's a childish dream 😂"",  absolutely amazing and you will enjoy, only the bad thing about Naruto sihppuden is ""fillers"" it was really annoying when you want to know what is gonna happen and the studio instead of continue the anime with manga,
                  they making fillers,  and that was too bad,  but for me I started it when manga was already finished, but anime still airing till 477 episode, so I didn't faced the fillers and kept going,  some of these fillers are worth to watch, and I will watch it. A bad thing or to me I didn't see it as a must to happen was the final battle, after you watch the 4th great ninja war maybe will find that it wasn't necessary to.make a battle between Naruto and Sasuke,  I didn't liked it, and the fight was exactly like Naruto part 1 when Sasuke left and Naruto tried to stop him, I didn't enjoyed as I was expecting.

Naruto Shippuuden is my favorite for it's action and adventure. It's has some  really sweet parts and other sad ones. The battles are amazing and intruging. I can't help but wach episoddes over and over and over again, wich for me is something I don't normally do. Naruto Shippuuden is awesome!!!

I really enjoy Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. One of the good anime I have seen lately. So I understand why some people give a hard time on Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. It has some parts I like some I didn’t like. Note I have not read the mang so.
So what is Naruto about? Spoilers. A boy that has lost his parents. End hi is the villager outcast only because of a lot of people died due to his birts. He got one part of the nine tail fox. During the anime, we will see how hie becomes the villager’s hero. And prove everyone
                  wrong.   
Good things.
The soundtrack and ost.
The soundtrack is amazing. I really feel the sadness. I feel when he wins. When I don’t know whet I when to listen to the ost. 
Characters development
Characters development is so good. I admit a cay more to Naruto then when I watch Violet Evergarden. They only to anime I have a cry too. You really the feeling when someone dying how it affects the people related. Some just want to take revenge and don’t cany to get revenge. 
Some just break down like when Jiraiya died Naruto was in a deep depression only his friends could help him. Everyone has maybe felt the same sometimes when you lost a family member or someone close to you. It plays a lot on the watcher’s feelings.
And Iruka Umino becomes like a father figure to naruto. I think some people find a father figure in people how they don’t have any family contact.
The world.
All the different villages have something interesting to it. Someplace is ikonic like the swing at the school, ramen Ichiraku, and Naruto house. One of my favorites is ending 34 it shows the ramen Ichiraku has been there for every for everything. 
The battels 
It amazing all I have to side. When they choose when to not have music or not. I found a Youtube video they explain my point.
Bad things
Naruto has a lot of good things but one of the bigs problems only problem for me is the filler episodes and filler arc. I like backstory but if the filler episodes or arc in the middle of another arc it is a problem. I watch the war arc it has some good thing but the biggest problem for me is they from nowhere a filler arc. And how will get in visited in the fight if start a filler arc or episodes. The place between two big arcs not in the middle of a big arc. 
A lot of anime which is not 720 episodes(Naruto and Naruto Shippūden)  have to don it match better. Like far Fairy Tail. Fairy Tail is only 328  episodes long. You place the filler arc or episodes between two big arcs, not in the middle of a big arc. But filler arc or episodes may not be that long.  
And one small about the fight. For me, it feels they switch a lot between the battels. How will I get invested in the fight? But a thing it was more in Naruto not, a lot in Naruto Shippūden.      
So should you watch Naruto? Absolutely. The time we live in right now some people may be stuck indoors. Then you have finished one of the big 3. You don’t have to watch Naruto Next Generations it like a side story. Hopp my English is understandable.",9
"
                ok...I honestly really like Naruto but i have one thing to say....
WTF IS UP WITH THE TWO MAIN RELATIONSHIPS?!
Ok so i know damn well Saske(idk if i spelled that right) didnt magicly falll in love with Sakura as soon as he left like he hated that bitch! And dont get me started on Naruto and Hinatas relationship shieeet how can he fall in love with her in one movie ONE. How was he blind the whole show but then she makes a scarf and then he can magicly see like..... MAKE IT MAKE SENCE. Saske deadass told Sakura she was annoying many times and keep
                  rejecting Naruto and going after the guy who dont like her -_- 
I know this is about shippuuden but why did they have to fuck up my niggas hair line like that....Seriously.
but thats all thank you :)",7
"
                This review is covering Naruto and it's sequel 'Naruto Shippuden' as I view them as inseparable.
Firstly, the story is an epic juggernaut. It ramps up and plateaus, ramps up again, takes you off cliff-hangers, makes you cheer, makes you cry. Some may say it is a little drawn out, others may say that there are too many filler episodes but everything adds to the crescendo, making character specific plot points that bit more meaningful. The world building of Naruto is second to none.
The art of Naruto evolved over the many years it was in production, it has many of the most recognisable characters in all
                  of anime, and dozens of its fight scenes are just pure, visual ecstasy.
The music in Naruto has more depth than the pacific ocean. It has great music throughout its 700+ episodes that I listen to in my lorry to this day.
Character development is simply a masterpiece. Untouchable. Not sure how else to put it into words.
Enjoyment, again, is unquantifiable. It changes peoples lives, Naruto transcended it's own genre like Muhammad Ali with boxing and Michael Jordan with Basketball.
Overall, I can only give a 10 to my favourite anime of all time. Yes 700+ episodes may seem daunting, but it's an experience you will never regret or forget.",10
"
                Undoubtedly the best shounen anime of all time (maybe bar one piece), and the long running show with the biggest fanbase is just a testament to how popular and good this series is. Naruto was my first anime (not counting pokemon) and still easily my favourite.I started this anime when i was a brat and watched another brat grow to the Hogake he's now. Everythings so awesome about naruto, that its hard to pick something and i have a very personal emotional attachment to naruto. With a vast world filled with jutsus and various techniques with awesome and unique character design for each character, breath
                  taking fights where ur screaming and ur blood's boiling till it bursts, the moments that render u speechless, just the right amount of deaths (not too less or not to overdone  like cough 'Akame ga kill'). and Naruto's character development is through the roof. This anime undoubtedly has the best villains overall, and the best villain anyways, with a backstories that make u sympathize with even Pain, who killed literally so many peeps (R.I.P. Pervy sage) and not to mention the most badass character ever, yes who else but the legendary Madara Uchiha. And the Kakashi Vs Obito, Madara Vs Guy, Naruto Vs Sasuke, every fight in Naruto has so much weight behind it, so much emotions behind them. The choreography is god tier. Naruto really set my bar for anime along with my bar for villains. The final showdown btw Naruto and Sasuke was very satisfying and exactly how a final fight's supposed to go down. There's still so much more i want to tell about Naruto but if this gets any bigger no one's gone read it. All i have left to say that this is the most ideal anime to start watching anime with.",10
"
                Naruto Shippuden is my favourite anime of all time. i followed this anime since i was little. this anime may have some lack, i still love this anime.
Story : 10/10
there may many people think naruto is some ordinary anime. i won't say so. From previous series, we knew that naruto dreams to become hokage someday, then he faces new conflict about sasuke is out from the village, and naruto is planning to get sasuke back. We may thinking about this series is about friendship ( getting sasuke back ), but is not as simple as that. Naruto faces a secret organization named akatsuki and they
                  had ambition to take all tailed beast. The akatsuki came, things getting complicated. Things are going beyond naruto and sasuke simple thinking. Sasuke, who has ambition to become stronger and kill his own brother, is regretting after succeeded killed itachi. Itachi has his own reason why he killed all uchiha clan member, and why he joined akatsuki,etc. and itachi kept it as secret. After killed his own brother, sasuke joined akatsuki, then willing to search for the truth about itachi.
Next is naruto. Naruto may be the most sad character. He is targetted by the akatsuki, and succeeded beating some of them. Later he found the truth about her father, mother, and himself.
The fight in this anime is not meaningless. It's not just fighting the villain after hardwork and win. It teach us many things. Like in the Pain Arc, Naruto is confused by nagato's question about how to make a peaceful world, and many meaningful things, not just that.
And my main reason why i liked the story is, everything is explained. The character backpast, the villain's motive, even the beginning of chakra.
Art : 9/10
It may be simple, but liked it. i think it does match with the anime. The fighting scene animation is smooth and i like it.
Sound : 8/10
I like the soundtrack, especially the opening and the ending. They are great. The sound that inserted in many scenes are matched and great. But, some fighting soundtrack is sounded too heroic, but it's acceptable to me.
Character : 10/10
The best. The character in this anime has their uniqueness, like their personality, their skills, etc.. The characters from the previous series are more mature. I really like the character development by feeling sadness and learning the truth.
Enjoyment : 9/10
I can't give 10/10 because there are toooo many fillers. Some filler episodes may be touching but they keep using the touching theme and then i bored. They are not important ( obviously ). I usually skip the filler episode ( I know the main story because i read the manga first ).
Overall : 9/10
Naruto shippuden is one of my most favourite anime of all time. It has deep story and unique character. Though it has many fillers, and many people hated it.
----- Sorry for grammar mistakes, and this is my first review. Thank you for reading.-----",9
"
                Note: Please watch the original series of Naruto and at least some episodes of Naruto Shippuuden to help you better understand my review. 
Well, to tell the truth, it is more like a Sasuke Shippuuden than Naruto Shippuuden... as most of the story (EXcluding the fillers seasons) are centered around the story of Sasuke-Itachi and Sasuke-Naruto. Sasuke gets more action, spotlight and plot & character development compared to Naruto.
Sasuke has to endure learning the real painful truth about Itachi... all the while, he has come into contact with all the main villains of the show... name it... he was Orochimaru's student... then he created his
                  own dangerous shinobi team... and even formed a pact with the Akatsuki for evil purposes. The Sasuke now is not the Sasuke we used to know before... after being away from Naruto and the rest of Konoha for so long, he has become more powerful and perhaps slightly arrogant… Besides that, the Sharingan also features heavily in the Sasuke-Itachi story as you will learn more about the Mangekyou Sharingan and the story behind it, most of which is a new and fresh tale regarding the Uchiha clan, naturally involving Uchiha Itachi as well. Moreover, Sasuke’s battles in Shippuuden steals the show effortlessly as he begins to show his new terrifying powers … the Sasuke-Itachi battle is definitely a must-watch. It kept my heart pounding as they keep using genjutsu (illusion) techniques and the Sharingan. Just awesome, the battle was.
Naruto’s adventure, on the other hand, dulls in comparison. Forget about the fillers and stuff, Naruto is still the same old, same old… hoping for Sasuke’s return, talking about bonds and friendship. Of course, Sasuke-Naruto is one of the favourites and a touching story but it gets frustrating when every time they try to locate Sasuke, they always fail to find him… and when they did find him, things start to get emotional (with the flashbacks and all) but Sasuke always manage to beat them and escape again and again. Naturally, Naruto gets disappointed and trains to get stronger than Sasuke… By the way, the 9 tails demon fox is also featured as the epitome of Naruto’s power, along with a newer and stronger Rasengan. 
To sum it up in a few sentences: (Main points)
 Mostly, Konoha is in danger of being destroyed.
 Sasuke is the latest bad guy in addition to the current cast of villains.
Good people (from Konoha) and bad people (from Akatsuki) die in battle.
The tale behind Mangekyou Sharingan.
Kakashi and Jiraiya’s past revealed.
Naruto’s friends’ growth (Hinata, Sakura, Rock Lee, Neji and others from Konoha's ninja teams have improved plenty. Gaara as well, he had his own story arc in the beginning episodes).
Sasuke’s own team… Hebi/Taka… dangerous ninjas hand-picked by Sasuke to form his own team for the purpose of revenge.
Myterious Akatsuki members.
All in all, Naruto Shippuuden is very enjoyable as all the characters we love are back in bigger, better ways, stronger and cooler-looking even... if not for the slow pacing and mountains of fillers, it definitely would have attracted all the old Naruto fans back.",8
"
                The storyline is so pathetic i could cry.
All it's mainly about is getting back an ex-team who isn't even worth saving.
*Spoilers beware*
He kills Itachi and for that he can gain no redemption. No he may have gotten redemption if he at done wat Itachi would have wanted. But no he declares he's going to get MORE revenge by killing off the entire village? How is that any better than what was done to you? Idiot.
*SPOILER ENDS*
the beginning was exciting. You think, YES Naruto will come back stronger, but no he just comes back with some maturity. Isnt until current manga chapters that he's actually badass.
                  And even then Sasuke is still in his league? How is this possible?
Pathetic.
Saving Gaara arc made Sakura actually seem likable until it ended and she reverted back to a loser.
Not worth getting hype up over, but still worth watching.",6
"
                With how decent Naruto part 1 was, many people moved on to Naruto Shippuden, part 2 of the popular anime series. While in the manga it is still called Naruto, Part 2 enters a 3 year time skip after the events of Naruto part 1. And here's where it all goes wrong. Not at the start of of course. Actually everything seems to be going the Naruto way (Not that that's perfect or anything, just serviceable). When you have a series that goes on this long, one would expect you to write yourself into many corners, and that's exactly what happens here. Naruto Shippuden taints
                  the foundation of what made Naruto so great. The animation is worse, the story loses focus, action shifts itself into a penis measuring contest where every fight tries to outdo the last with little to no fines or choreography, characters stay one dimensional throughout the entire run time, and of course we shift from a story about ninjas into a story about divine power and who gets to own it. Most people may see this as ""upping the ante"", but to me, it's just a lazy and poorly written way to boost manga sales and anime views without actually delivering some worthwhile content that can leave a deep impact emotionally, like a story should. Naruto Shippuden also manages to somehow rewrite it's own themes and messages given prior and ruin some of it's lead cast of characters, including Naruto Uzumaki himself. The series succeeds to pull things from out of nowhere, and treat them as standard fare. How was Guy able to even leave a scratch on Six Paths Madara? (I know it was the eight gate, but Madara was basically omnipotent at that point, and taijutsu did him in a bit? Bullshit) How was it that Kaguya's will was used to create Black Zetsu when we saw Madara create it himself? How was Madara able to revive himself with izanagi if he was already dead? How come Obito was able to survive the Ten Tails extraction? Better yet, why the fuck does Kaguya even exist?! And why is Naruto the Child of Prophecy when his characters theme was carving your own path? And by god that horribly rushed ending... I can go on about how Naruto Shippuden really dropped the ball, but it would take too long. In short, Shippuden seems ambitious, but it falls flat in the end with little to no pay off.",3
"
                Naruto is a good show,but when it comes to Saske and Sakura it sucks.She is willing to die for him when he is trying to kill her.Every time that happens Naruto comes to the rescue.Sakura hates Naruto's guts.I believe Naruto is actually going to die if this keeps up.Like in that episode when Saske leaves her under water and Naruto comes to save her.Anyway after reading this you should look into this to see how he is sacrafising her.Please leave good comments and send friend requests.Thanks and good bye hope you liked it.

                Everyone, regardless if one is an anime viewer or not, will know Naruto. 
It had been the highlight of Anime Industry for years now. It is known for the story and actually created a craze for anime in a lot of people, including me. But Shippuuden is rather plagued with Fillers. 
Story: 7
Kishimoto has done an amazing job, creating a story while taking enough time to develop characters. The story has its twists and turns and is able to grip you into it. There are a few inconsistency in the timeline, especially Itachi and Kakashi, mostly because these characters were over developed.
Art: 5
The art is
                  good but the quality of the animation depends heavily on the studio. It can go from hand drawn like lazy animation to the best 2D animations. The low score is especially because of lack of quality in fillers.
 Sound: 8
Intense and gripping.
Character: 8
Well developed. Kishimoto has again, outdone himself in creating his characters. Each character grown in his own accord though secondary characters are quite just their parents replica and i expect it to be the same in Boruto,
Enjoyment: 8
I have loved Naruto for more than half a decade now  I can't give an uniased opinion unless it is about the fillers.
Overall: 7",7
"
                This series is a spectacle in the shounen genre. Let us not mince words!! This show succeeds in utilizing its cast of secondary characters due to a long episode count and filler episode budget that the animation studio has. Battle sequences are epic where new abilities need to be learned for our main character to keep up with the looming threats wanting to destroy the shinobi world. The villains in Naruto are very fleshed out. Naruto Shippuuden gets you invested in the main characters and rooting for them quickly into the first Akatsuki onslaught. The filler episodes fall into the ""hit-or-miss"" category, so if you
                  are watching for the story or over-the-top shounen fights, you might wanna have a list of filler episodes ready so that you can accelerate thru the long episode count. I don't suggest marathoning such a long-running shounen; save your sanity. But this shounen is worth the watch!!",8
"
                Imo this is the perfect show has best characters ive seen along with emotion crazy fights long story great powers apart from filler its awesome,itachi kakashi madara obito naruto sasuke gaara just to name a few of the best characters.
iD give it a 10 and other than hxh only 10 ive given.If you like  ashow which is goofy serious emotional intense its perfect it gets the occasional hate duie to the large fandom but i belive its worthy of the hype no show has hit me like naruto and ive watched it twice this year due to how good it is

                Time for my review of the day.
Naruto Shippuden is not that bad of an anime. Some people would disagree with me, and to be perfectly honest, I prefer short anime (100-) since most of them just so happen to have a better storyline (even so I wish they were longer) than the longer ones (not just saying Naruto Shippuden, but some of the longer ones seemed a bit boring sometimes), however, that does not mean I did not enjoy this anime. I recommend this anime to you if you like fighting/supernatural anime.
For the story, I give this anime an eight out of ten. I could
                  keep up with the story, but the anime is filled with so much fillers that it still managed to throw me off from time to time.
The art was well done, and at some points in the anime, it seemed more realistic. Ten out of ten.
The characters' voicing and overall sounds, I would give it an eight out of ten.
The characters themselves… I didn't really like the characters that much. There are a few in which I've enjoyed, such as Itachi, one of the characters in the anime, but overall, I would give this section a six out of ten.
I was enjoying myself almost throughout the entire anime, but the fillers seemed to be a bit boring sometimes. Eight out of ten.
All and all, I would give this anime an eight out of ten. I recommend this anime to you guys if you've enjoyed Bleach or Fairy Tail.",8
"
                I don't know why people say it's the most cliche anime ever but to me it is most definitely not! The first series was okay saying it was not all actual storyline and some random episodes of nothingness but it's evolved to a complex meaningful storyline if you can't handle a lot of different storylines at once then don't hate on it. It is fun, action packed, exciting and yes sad all at the same time. I won't tell you how it's sad because that's for you to find out but it is a really great storyline and meaningful i would recommend this to people
                  who like action, can handle a lot, or someone who want's a meaningful storyline.",10
"
                Settle in it's going to be a long ride.
I know that doesn't seem like much to say about this show but it really will be a long show. Not only that each episode takes like eight years to do anything. So watch the show in clumps if you get a chance.
              ",6
"
                This is one of the most inspirational,motivational,emotional and enjoyable anime ever made.Better than the original series,Naruto Shippuden initially deals with Naruto and Sasuke's reunion.With this as the main motive,the series progresses through unveiling of many dark secrets and the history of the supporting characters.But after episode 216,the story takes a different turn.Although Naruto and Sasuke did not become friends till then,there was another tale of ten tails and sage of six paths.The story initially becomes interesting but now it is becoming boring and boring as it progresses very slowly.The manga is finished already but the anime will atleast take 1-1.5 years to finish along with
                  fillers from now.Story is pretty good as there is a sudden turn of events and there appears some overpowered characters.Though the fillers ruin the story and from episode 427 to now the fillers are going on.If there is one canon episode there are 2/3 fillers.This is ridiculously boring.So,Story is 8/10 for the slow progress in the later episodes.
Art
Art and animation is one bad part of the anime.Naruto shippuden's art is better than naruto but still it is an average one.though it is a bit sad to see such a good anime with bad art but still this part of the anime deserves 7/10 from me.
Sound
One of the strong parts of the anime.The sound and music of shippuden is fantastic.It just blows out of my mind when i remember shippuden's background music.The emotional scenes are showed with such emotional tone that it is heart aching.10/10 for sound.
Character
The best part of the anime.All characters are unique in their own way and almost none of them looks boring (sometimes it looks though).Best character in the whole anime is itachi uchiha and then naruto,kakashi,pain,killer bee.Itachi's character is just unforgetabble.All others are also very good except some(in my opinion)-Raikage,Mizukage,Sasori,Kiba and some.But still it deserves 9/10.
Enjoyment
Of course, i enjoy.If it is asked that do you enjoy naruto shippuden i think it is a silly question.(i'm not including fillers) The fights are amazing with some twists and the taijutsu is the most fascinating.Best fighter in naruto according to me is shikamaru.Just brilliant fight with hidan.I wished he could have fought more in the anime.Enjoyment is 10/10.
Overall-9/10
Naruto Shippuden is a very good and interesting anime that you must watch.The complain about fillers is just unacceptable.Fillers are being broadcasted.Simple-Just don't watch them.I've  watched some of the fillers and i came to know that fillers doesn't even have 1% relation with the story.It is just set in the middle of arcs,So i don't watch nowadays.Just be patient.Keep yourself informed about the next episode whether it is a filler or canon.That's the simple way.If you cannot wait for 1 week or 2 week or sometimes 2/3 months then how can you watch the bbc series sherlock???Naruto Shippuden is a very underrated anime.It is not a masterpiece but definitely worth watching as it is very much thrilling and enjoying to watch",9
"
                It took me a whole year to finish the Naruto: Shippuuden series. One of the reasons is my inconsistency to anime, the other however is the times I've simply got bored from the amount of unnecessary episodes in a row there were. The amount of fillers there are is the LARGEST flaw this series has to offer. Some viewers decide to skip filler episodes which is a viable solution, seeing that there are little fillers with contribution to the actual story. Another flaw the show has is the soundtrack, it becomes tedious and almost aggravating hearing the same soundtrack a hundred times over a conversation
                  or in a fight scene, I may be overreacting but it's something that upset me. The last flaw i have to talk about is Naruto's determination to return Sasuke. (I hope this common knowledge among everyone and I'm not spoiling anything) I found it very hard to accept that a human could be so determined to go after someone like Naruto did with Sasuke, specifically because how little time they spent together and they hadn't gotten along all that well. The whole ""Because you're my friend"" reasoning wore out real soon and just looked like it was a makeshift pillar to hold up the story. I'm sorry if others feel differently than I do about this aspect in the story but it's how I viewed it.
The rest of the story for me, was amazing. I absolutely loved the branching story lines throughout each of the characters, taking place in several eras. The switching of antagonists is something I adored, especially whenever they seemingly turned a new leaf (hehe.) The most crucial fight scenes in the story held lots of importance and gave users many different emotions making them near perfectly put together. Watching Naruto change over time in the story was the most beautiful aspect to me which puts Naruto: Shippuuden in a place close to my heart.",9
"
                This is my first time ever writing a review so it probably won't be all that amazing. I don't plan on writing out a novel and will try to keep it as ""short and sweet."" 
I have been currently watching Naruto and I am almost completely caught up. I may not be one of those ""die hard""  fans who've watched episode 1 from day one.  And I was able to ""cheat""  and pass through all the fillers and focus on the story.  I know naruto gets a lot of hate,  but this is my first time really watching a shounen
                  anime and I love it! 
Now to the point, Naruto may not be the most original of stories since the whole ninja story has been done over and over again. And some parts of the story may  be over done but,  the story still manages to keep me interested and hooked!  In ""Naruto""  the first series it is definitely more light hearted and mostly used to introduce characters so you reallyyyyy get to know them. Shippuden is much darker and be prepared to take a ride on the feel train cause this has a lot of feels. Even though the story is good what really drew me to naruto was the character development.  Shippuden digs into character development even more which really helps you feel for each character. What I like about naruto is that there is no ""real villian""  in the series.  Most of the ""villians""  became that way due to hardships in life.  Which reminds me of when I was in school we read ""The Lord of the Flies.""  and we discussed the idea if one is simply born evil or if one can simply become evil.  In naruto they play on the idea that everyone is good but sometimes due to events where there is light there is always shadows.  You don't just relate and feel for the ""good guys""  but for the ""villains""  as well. Love and Hate is a huge theme throughout  the series. Which plays a big part in who each character is and how they turned out.  Naruto also shows that ""Love conquers all.""  take the main character Naruto for example; he grew up with the Nine tails living inside him which caused everyone to fear him and avoid him,  which caused Naruto loneliness and hatred but,  with the love he received from others he turned in to the person he is today.  This helps him be able to relate to others and to save them.  One last thing is Naruto has some great battle scenes so prepare for some ""Action Boners!"" one thing I like about some of the battles is that they aren't your typical high action fights with lots of explosions (which there are battles like that)  there are a few fight scenes that are really emotional and even though some fists are shared it is the ""words""  that do the real damage and those in my opinion are my favorite battles in the series.  I definitely recommend naruto the story is good but the character development is even better.  I am going to end this now since it's starting to turn in to a novel!  I really hope this helps someone out and convinces you to give this a chance!",10
"
                I can't get enough! Its a strong well built anime/manga full of action, drama, romance, and comedy. I think i have actually teared up a few times from some of the episodes. 100% worth watching! a tip though, if you watch it on Hulu, DONT READ ANYONES COMMENTS! people are always putting spoilers in the comments, and hulu doesnt delete them, they just stare at u screaming THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS!
              ",9
"
                I can easily say that Naruto Shippuuden is hands down the BEST anime I have seen.
It has everything from action, to comedy, romance, friendship and more. The message that Naruto himself portrays is a very important one that many people could take note of in their every day real lives.
The main story line is gripping, with lots of twists that tug on your heart strings.
I see many others complaining about fillers and such, but I think the fillers are great to get to know the back story of different characters and not just the main ones.
All in all, a fantastic show that any anime lover
                  should at least watch once!",10
"
                Growing up with it , all i can say is that all the 90`s kids should agree with me that Naruto is one of the greatest anime ever made ! So i ain`t got so much to say about it !
The openings and the endings are amazing, u just can`t skip them ! The story is enjoyable ! The characters and the art are great as well ! (spoiler) Naruto is that kind of main character that is weak at the beginning, but at the end becomes the strongest      
( love him ) ! Sadness happiness anger, all of those

                Naruto Shipuden Review 
------------------------ 
So this is a second part to my original review I made last night on Naruto. I am going to have another prr on Boruto which is my favorite. Before I watched the original Naruto series I watched an episode of Shipudden first because I did not know there was a major plot. I did not even know who like all these characters is. I mean like Sai pr whoever that was, he was hella tripping because he showed up in the second series and was never in the first series like this dood cant be pulling up this its crazy.
                  Anyways the way how to story contiened was lit. It sucks how everyone became chunin and Naruto was training with pervy sage. like that neji bruh showing off he was jonin was pissing me off. Naruto is more op that all these fools combined and everyone keeps conplaining hes still a genin. Bruh this is when Naruto is suppose to become a hero like wtf. Anyways when Naruto shows his new powers and stuff and Sakura was trying to hit that i was like bout to go off with that ship and forget hinata but she still aint over sasuke but that k cuz sasuke actually gets cold after this 2 years. This bruh becomes op af cuz his training and yuh he def surpassed Naruto first. Tbh I feel like Naruto only grew as a person and not with his power like he did not even control the nine tail fox yet or whatever. was i also the only one to notice that every main character from team 7 had a legendary sanin. Its crazy but true. So after the second series I think i finally decided my lists of favorite people and it was really hard. So my favorite person would have to be Sasuke just the second series he becomes cooler or whatever and he just is coll but personality wise I do not know about that and we really dont have much to relate but I guess this person is just someone i like as a person. Second favorite person is alot like me and it was really hard between sasuke because rock lee is the oppisite of sasuke but he just is really cool and unique and never gives up. To be honest i liked him more in the first series because the second series he barely showed up in filler episodes. I did like alot of filler episodes but some It feels just forced. On of my favorite filler episodes is in the first season near the end with the team was Naruto, Choji, and Sakura thats a dream team tbh. Also another dream team would be Sasuke, Ino, and Sakura, Another good team would be Rock Lee, Ten Ten, and Neji. Oh wait that is a team. So anyway back to my third favorite character it is still tied up with the two characters Sasuke, and Rock Lee but it has to be Naruto. I dont know but if you were to mix Naruto, Sasuke, and Rock Lee it would most likely make me hust personality wise. Anyway it would probably seem to be Boruto because boruto works hard, is arrogant and is dumb sometimes which is my ideal favorite character. Anyways since Boruto is not in the second series I cannot put him at first. So at fourth Im gonna have to put Choji, so choji is not me but its like a friend id like to have because he eats all the time and is very funny. Tbh it was really cool to see him fight in intense battles espcially the one back in the first series againts that other fat guy and him using pills. It was weird because those food pills made him grow fatter and bigger and it kind of reminded me of other pulls that exist in real life. If you know what I mean. So another character I liked after choji would have to be a girl this time which is Sakura. So Sakura kind of a Dva but when she is in almost every episode 700 episodes 700 x 30 is like 21000 monutes with is like days and days maybe like even a week straight of sakura its like she is kinda of popping sometimes but tbh if Ino was a mainchaarcter and not supporting I dig that to. So fifth im going to have to go with Kiba. Look Kiba I liked from the beginning Early and I almost considered him my favorite character until he started talking that smack to Naruto that he was not Chunin. This brother is legit way more op than yo furry looking ass and you legit be talking that sneak dissing to Naruto like bruh shame on you brother u aint deserve to be shinobi like this ninja really be talking that mad smack. Okay so my 6th favorte character has to be Shikinaru but tbh I guess he got those made thoughts but he dont try or say everything a drag but this ninja a drag to but i felt for him after Asuna which got me actually in tears no cap no joke I dont play in this snitch. So the story art, enjoyment goes into the first Naruto series which I will put below.
Even though everything was good about the series the story was the best part. Out of all the anime I have ever watched I was never so engaged with a series like this one. What made the plot so good was because of how long it is and to be honest even if the show was 12 episodes like most of the shows I have watched in the past it could have been great still but not as good if the story was just in 12 episodes. In the beginning the story was great but compared to the future plot it was average. It was cool seeing how the rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke started and the first couple episodes with Naruto playing around with Sasuke and Sakura was like a fun slice of life. It is so cool that all the characters from episode 1 still exist 700 episodes later in the boruto series. It is just really cool to see this. The first C mission they did was cool because you see Naruto being annyoing but super cool as well. The chunin exams to be honest were kind of the best thing I have ever watched. This anime season of Naruto was like th best even though it was realesed during 2003. Its crazy because this was made when I was born I legit was 0 years old well this was being animated even though it is weird because the manga started in 1999 this is crayz because it existed as long as spongebob. I use to think everything made before 2010 is trash but alot of old school things are cool. The chunin exam was the most smartest thing I have ever seen in the series like legit it rose my IQ. It was so funny when Naruto did not know like anything and he was just writing down nothing. Hinata and stuff was offering him questions and at this scene I got kind of pissed cause Naruto can not see that Hinata likes him its crazy. Anyway the exams in the beginning I could tell it took alot of thought. Anyway the second exam kind of reminding me of a battle royale because they are in the forest and teams are being elimanated. I was watching Naruto and this season around the time PUBG and fortnite was becoming popular. Its crazy because I thought minecraft hungergames in like 2011 than I learned about the Battle Royale Movie from like 2000's. Than this which was crazy. At the third exams when all those kids were fighting from the main characters. It really shows the personalities of the characters. Kiba vs Naruto was my third favorite fight because it was like dog vs fox because they both have animals inside of them. The hyuga clan fight was also lit as well even though Hinata loss but they got some bonding experience which I really enjoyed. The best fight was between Rock Lee and Gaara. Tbh I never really likes Gaara he reminds me of a messed up kid who has no friends. Legit I do not feel like I have empathy for this guy even over all his flashbacks. I feel like with the right personality you can make urself likeable even if you have an animals with tails. So Rock Lee when he took off those weights it legit got me fired up. Sorry about that fairytail reference. Look the Neji fight where he took revenge for Hinata when Naruto got those good speech. Legit everybody doubted Naruto. He showed his ninja way in that fight you know but I aint spoiling anything but that fight is the reason is why Naruto is Naruto. Look I had a handful of fights and though fights are not always like this. Look fights are one sided in real life but it is so cool to see fights where you see alot of comebacks. So the fight with Shikimaru look I cant say his name but that was pretty analytical and I kind of got pissed on what rank he became because of what he done because I feel like it should be someone more deserving with power. So Sasuke is really cool and was not my favorite in the beginning because I was not digging his blue shirt but later he becomes cool. In the beginning I feel like he did not know what he was doing but his Chidori was popping espically when he popped Gaaras little pimple looking barrier. Like what was he trying to finna do it was crazy. So anyway after that the fights between that puppet guy and Shino was decent not something to remember though. Anyways the training with Jiriya whats im talking bout was the funniest thing ever and how he was training for summoning or whatever. Anyways him using that in the fight with Gaara and saying how they had the same childhood or whatever was lit. To be honest I do not believe they the same. They may of had the same childhood but what about personalize wise. Naruto is cool and funny but Gaara is not. He gained his powers from birth and Naruto work hard for this also Rock Lee is lit. Bruh him training for 10 hours straight. 24/7 GRIND that is the Rock Lee way and his ninja way and he did not deserve what he got. Look Gaara thinks his life is so hard being op and whatever but no no no. Anyway lets talk about someone who does not work at all but is also lit and this is Choji. Choji has the nonstop grind on the food though. Like I love how he eats so much potato chips and ramen. Look I eat a lot of ramen and eat noodles. Kiba is lit but also I have a grudge against him because the way he talks to his dog is hella akward. I feel like this dood is a furry tbh but who cares anyway he still is lit. Neji is an okay character and reminds me of me when I was like 5 for reasons I will not tell you at all. So after the Gaara vs Naruto their was alot of filler episodes until when the gang which is Neji, Shikimarou, Choji, Kiba, and Naruto goes and tries to retrieve Sasuke from becoming evil. It was so cool seing each one of them going after a bad guy with 2x the amount of power but since they ninjas they still found away like ghost busters. So after all of these fights it made me realize their is alot more meaning to life even though I wasted alot watching Naruto. To be honest during this time I could of been spending time on so many other things but again im wasting my life and I do not even know why its crazy. I think thats it for the story and I would give it a 10 out of 10 ok.
The art was from 2007 so I guess it was okay for 2007. It got a 10 after 2010 though.
The soundtrack for Naruto and openings pumped me up espically opening 2,5, and I think 8.
Enjoyment was a 10 because of the ships and how they sailed.
Overall a 10.",10
"
                I personally feel that this anime is one of the best I've watched, due to the darker atmosphere it gives compared to the original Naruto and the addictive nature of the plot. Definitely worth watching.
P.s Other reviews seems so pedantic and picky towards the anime; this anime is completely worth watching. Enjoy it and stop complaining, people.

                Salut à tous enfin une Review fait en français ! 
Je vais faire cette Review sur l'histoire complète même si on est sur Shippuden.
Premièrement, l'histoire ; Une histoire Incroyable remplis d'aventure, de rebondissement et de passage émouvant. Une moral perçu tout au long de l'animé ; ne jamais baisser les bras et toujours suivre sont rêve peut importe ce que le monde dise sur toi. Cette moral très éducative pour les jeunes et aussi les moins jeunes. L'histoire j'accorde donc un 10/10 
Deuxièmement, les arts et sons ; Les sons très bien fait digne des meilleurs studio de production on rencontre parfois quelques problèmes de
                  son mais quelque fois dû qu'au site de Streaming, Les dessins très colorés, avec de bon contraste. On peut facilement distinguer même en enlevant le son quelle émotion ressort lorsque qu'on les regarde. J'accorde donc un 9/10 pour l'arts et sons.
Troisièmement, les personnages ; Très Charismatique les personnages on chacun leurs styles propres. On peut très bien se lié au personnage qui nous ressemble le plus ainsi comprendre celui-ci. Pour la catégorie Personnage j'accorde donc un 10/10. 
Pour finir, en général cet anime très coloré avec des personnages charismatique et une histoire où l'on passe parmi toutes les émotions j'accorde donc un 10/10 à ce Chef-d'oeuvre du studio Pierrot et l'auteur Masashi Kishimoto. 
Merci d'avoir lu, Axolott",10

                Naruto is a standard shonen with just the right mix of elements to make it enjoyable. It certainly does not excel at anything in particular, but it sure won't bore you out. Being a shonen that was created after flagship titles like Dragon Ball Z and Yuyu Hakusho, you will see many of those series character stereotypes and attacks/skills in Naruto Shippuuden. Of course, the series comes up with its own which are pretty amazing, if you are into that kind of thing. (No, no world destroying Big Bang Attack or Kame Hame Ha, but you will see a couple of meteorites =P)

"
                 Great Animation, Intricate and emotional story-line, deeply recurring morals, person to self conflict, ... Overall Naruto is an amazing anime, to have the dedication to watch/read all of it his hard to grasp at first, but after a while you become deeply attached to it, borderline obsessed. Naruto is an amazing character, and I learned to have determination from im. He is inspirational in his struggle to overcome his flaws, to keep moving forward even in the toughest of times. The raw emotion Naruto exhibits at times is so personal that even the watcher can feel his pain. In a sense, they make the
                  reader become frustrated at naruto for his flaws and hate his determination to make the reader understand first-hand how much naruto suffers from hate. They essentially make the reader empathize with those that put naruto down, to later realize the affect it has on him. This is truly a master piece, after so many years Naruto has still kept my attention, something extremely difficult to manage with an anime as long as this one.",10
"
                Story- 9/10 
I enjoyed the story of this anime adaptation alot! I mean alot! the manga naruto shippuden that follows on from naruto (prequel). I never read the manga of either naruto or naruto shippuden but after watching the anime i was intrigued mostly every episode and i fully enjoyed watching it. I am not going to pinpoint every tiny detail because the story in general is worthy of 9/10 or even 10/10.
art- 10/10 
The evolution of the naruto shippuden art is outstanding to say the least, by just watching the anime openings you see frame by frame how much detail and pure ,beautiful art
                  and time the animation studio put into this anime. I don’t even need to say anything to explain why i am giving this a 10/10 so i will leave it at that.
Sound- 7/10
The sound was pretty good, it was all in sync as it should alot of great voice acting and also great action sound effects. However, i did hear repeated music in some scenes which i did not mind but i also heard some use of the same action sound effects which were quite annoying which is why i am giving it a 7/10.
Character- 10/10
The characters in naruto shippuden were questionable to some but for me i would say most of the characters had good story plot to them and were developed through time and you would able to see that in the series as you progress through different arcs of the anime. 
Enjoyment- 10/10 
Naruto shippuden has alot of wacky jokes here and there or great plot and even great action scenes. I found it to be very enjoyable 10/10
Overall- 10/10
In conclusion, this anime is one of the best out there among the top and yes it has its faults but its most likely up to personal preference of what you think of this anime adaptation.",10

                You'll probably read a lot of reviews, good and bad, about Naruto Shippuden. Personally, I was glad that the old Naruto ended and we had a time skip to when they are teenagers (not that I didn't enjoy some aspects of the old one but that's a whole other review).
Story: I like that they all have grown up a bit. You can tell some thought has been put into their characters now. Even Sakura (cringe) has developed characteristically some. Naruto isn't *totally* a blubbering idiot. After awhile it just gets annoying to see everyone whining and acting like the elementary kids they are modeled to
                  be. The story has some darkness to it now. The Akatsuki are rampaging across the Ninja Lands. Everyone is forced to fight. I mean, it's becoming a more adult(ish) anime while still preserving funny parts. Of course, we'd love to skip the fillers if we could, but truthfully, a lot of my favorite episodes have been fillers. I think most of them (not all) are beneficial to developing the characters and, let's face it, it's just that many more episodes to look back on after Naruto is over for good.
Art: I rated this a 7 because they can really change from awesome to... (well see certain scenes of the Pain arc). It just seems sometimes the ""good"" artists took a sick day or something when some episodes are being done.
Sound: I love just about all of the opening and closing songs. They are usually fitting choices with the feel they seem to be going for at the time. Also, their sounds effects are average enough to not seem to noticeably out of place. The songs they use in the episodes are okay, it's just that they've used most of the same ones since the beginning of Naruto and, frankly, I'm getting tired of the recycling. I think the fans are worth looking up a few more pieces of music... Also, sometimes they play their ""epic"" song (I don't know these names I just know that they play this when Naruto starts to get hyped up about something) at random times. It usually causes a good laugh.
Character: As I said before, I really like that things seem to be growing up more than before. It's hard to describe without spoilers, but it just seems to mature which is great.
Enjoyment: I eagerly sign on every Thursday to check out the newest episode and watch it on the spot whether its a filler or not. I enjoy the show and I'll probably be following to the very end.
Overall it's an 8 for me. It would be higher, but for the sheer mass of fillers, random sound issues, and sloppy artwork from time to time. I would like to add one last thing, though: I can deal with the fillers, but the thing that makes me want to punch my computer screen is the flashbacks. Flashbacks every four seconds usually. There was one recent episode (at the Summit) that was one giant flashback recapping ALL of the episodes including the original Naruto. My. God. I understand that we need some from time to time to refresh our memories, but it got to the point that I could start reciting parts of scenes because of the flashbacks. Biggest downside: flashbacks.
Anyways, I'd still recommend this anime to anyone who asked. I think it's dumb not to give it a try just because it's popular. It's just as stupid to NOT do something because it's popular than to do it because it is.",8
"
                This is my first review ever so be kind on the criticism everyone!
Naruto has been a big part of my life growing up, I used to buy pirated Dvds back when the Og Naruto(The prequel to this) was airing since our local cartoon network only aired the same episodes over and over again. Although I'm grateful for that because thats exactly why I grew watching and loving Naruto. It was a way of life for me and my little brothers. I basically grabbed any chance to buy anything Naruto related whether it be a game console (Bought a Ps2 just for Naruto games lol). But
                  anyways, I'm a massive shonen fan, You'll find mostly shonen anime in all my favourite spots on my profile but the thing is now that I look back, Maybe Naruto was the reason why I started loving this genre in the first place even before I even knew what anime was. Simply put, Its just one of the most amazing rides you can ever have while watching an anime(it has surpassed the medium itself actually in terms of popularity). Even though it ended a few years ago it is still without a doubt one of the most popular, well written, controversial and renowned anime all over the world!
Animation : 9.5 (While it certainly could be even better its still amazing for the time that it was airing)
Characters: 10/10 (Every character is so loved that all of them have their own fanbases and they even rival those of the Main characters) That tells you a lot about the character writing. Some of the most memorable characters in all of anime even!
Soundtrack: 10/10 (Banger songs, Openings and Endings everywhere, Even to this day I listen to some Naruto songs while driving my car, They're that good yeah)
Enjoyment : 10/10 (My message to all the people reading this review and the new anime watchers is that Dont be afraid to start a big series like Naruto, The pacing can get dragging at times, some moments might go against your belief, You might not even like it that much but atleast it should be watched atleast once by someone who knows nothing about this anime!
I've seen the series multiple times (Yes including fillers and how badly I wish I could erase my memory and experience it from the beginning all over again because Naruto is not just an anime, To me it was my childhood and one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life doing anything! It will stay in my heart till the day I die!",10
"
                Bottom Line Up Front: It is easy to be disenchanted by typical shonen pitfalls, but if you can get past issues such as abundance of fillers and flashbacks, Shippuden actually has some memorable events which make it worthwhile to watch. It is not the Mecca of anime that it is made out to be by young teens, however it surprisingly has depth when you least expect it.
Highs: Humor at times, easy to like protagonist for his abundance of imperfections, periodically deals with mature issues despite its' ""innocence"", death of ""good"" characters, interesting story
Lows: Superficial at times, over use of filler and flashbacks, adolescent fanbase catering
                  degrades series overall",8
"
                ""In the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum, that's true, but those who abandon their friends are worse than scum."" What a fun and long winded journey this was, but damn Im glad I experienced it. Last year I was one of few anime fans that never watched Naruto and now Im one of many to have completed the series. The prequel series ended with Naruto leaving his village to train with his sensei Jiraiya in order to prepare for his encounter with the Akatsuki. On the other hand Sasuke joined Orochimaru so he can get stronger in order to kill his
                  brother Itachi. Due to the huge events waiting to come I had very high expectations heading into the sequel. The original was very good series with awesome fight scenes and did a great job on introducing the ninja world to the audience. I was both excited and nervous to see how the series as a whole would conclude hoping it would explore more of the ninja world and some of its characters. Now time to review the long sequel that is Naruto: Shippuden.***contains MINOR spoilers***
Story:8/10
A great long winded coming of age story with deep themes and lots of depth. The series isn't just about ninja conflict but about people growing up. We see Naruto and his friends go from children to teenagers to grown up in a way that's very satisfying given all the dark moments they go through. Where the story truly excels is its world building. We are given all of the ancient history of the ninja world and it's all greatly expanded upon in the series. We learn all about the villages and great nations on how they look and impact the story and how they all contribute with one another. Pacing issues at times are a problem as there are so many training sequences with Naruto to the point where it got kinda repetitive. The story was also dragged heavily with once again its use of flashbacks and filler. However having seen all the back and side stories really packed an emotional punch that added so much depth to the main plot and in some ways outshined it. The story had several great moments but towards the end made some bad choices during the Fourth Ninja War. Overall the storyline is better than most shonens that Ive seen thus far.
Art:9/10
Shippuden is a series that when it wants to it looks so damn GREAT. It became noticeable that during the more intense and violent battles of the series it uses different style animation that helps make the movements more fluid. This was done by animator Norio Matsumoto and notable examples of this would be Sasuke vs Deidara and Kakashi vs Obito. However the animation in the series wasn't always great and at times it looked too exaggerated. The most perfect example of this would be Naruto vs Pain where in some shots the fight looks so bad to the point fans made memes out of it. Usually in a long series keeping consistent animation is a hard thing to do and Shippuden does at times suffer from this but thumbs up for the series for not being afraid to use different animation for some of its scenes. Where the series really improve from the original were its editing and use of color palette. There are some views and angles of the series where it just looks downright beautiful that we didn't really get from the prequel. All in all it's the battles scenes where the art truly excels and its one of many reasons why Naruto is considered to have one of anime's most memorable fights. 
Sound:9/10
One of my favorite things about this series is how memorable most of the quotes are. ""You presumptuously see yourself as the ruling powers, and distance yourself from death. Softened by peace, you've become thoughtless. Kill and be killed. Hatred connects the two."" All of this was helped by great voice acting by the cast and there's so many quotes to choose from. The music overall is very good. Most of the tracks portraying some of the scenes more intense and emotional moments. Arguably the best track is Pain's theme song ""Girei"" it's a very dark and godly track that perfectly portrays the character. As for the opening and ending themes some were very good but some were okay. My favorite opening would have to be the first one ""Hero's Come Back"" from Nobodyknows. The OST's biggest strength were definitely the background tracks. 
Character:10/10
It is here where I think the series truly shines. The franchise as a whole is so character driven and really does an amazing job at making us feel for them especially the villains. There are some many characters that have their moments to leave an impression on the audience whether if it's from the use of backstory, interactions, personalities, or abilities. What makes this cast so fun is how much variety they have in their abilities. There are ninja who can spit fire, turn into paper, become giants, heal wounds, take over bodies, you name it and it really helps add joy to the cast as a whole. Character development is also big here as so many people learn and undergo changes from character arcs and make them complete. As with a lot of large casts giving depth to all is very tough and towards the end of the series a lot side characters do get pushed to the back to lead way for Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. It even throws in a villain at the very end with little to no build up and it really didn't help at all. Even so the series does such an amazing job at making most of its cast feel relevant to the storyline.
Final Verdict
Pros
+Strong coming of age story with great exploration of deep themes(war, discrimination, vengeance, etc)
+A dominate cast with a surprising amount of complexity and backstory
+Outstanding world building that completely fleshes out the ninja world
+The final battle between Naruto and Sasuke
Cons
-THOSE DAMN FLASHBACKS!!
-Narrative starts to lose momentum as the series progresses
-Fourth Ninja World War
Personal Favorites
Character(s): Kakashi, Pain, and Itachi
Arc: Pain Assault
Fight: Kakashi vs Obito
Boy what a long yet legendary series this was. Naruto is a series of highs and lows but its highs really do outshine the lows for the most part. The franchise is an iconic juggernaut with huge merchandise and sales and its hard to find people who haven't heard of it. It has strong storylines, great battles, awesome characters, deep moments, I would have to say that it's w/o a doubt one of the best shonens anime has had yet and it's a franchise that I see myself talking about for years to come.

                It's way too old....back when I was in school watching some random Anime, I was told by my friend that a new Anime named Naruto is going to start soon in CN. That's when everything was changed....!!
I have seen the first episode, to me it was amazing. It captivated me completely. That Anime had made a great impact on my life. I've learned so many things from that Anime. High in morals, it changed my way of thinking.
I'm here to write a review on Naruto Shippuden which is a part of Naruto's world.
To all Naruto/Naruto Shippuden Haters who think that Naruto isn't the best anime.....I
                  disagree with you...coz is not only the best it's greatest of all time. And one more thing, Naruto/Naruto Shippuden is not for immatures and those who run out of patience very quickly.
I consider it as Masterpiece.
I do hate fillers...but I like them as well because even fillers in Naruto/Naruto Shippuden has something to do with the morals and the way of living.
We all know that story revolves around a knucklehead Ninja who wants everyone to acknowledge him. With help his friends he was able to finally achieve it.
There are so many reasons why I like this Anime....they are:
1. Great Story(High in Morals)
2. Deep Characterization(every character in this Anime teaches some good to us, you will get attached to them)
3. Evolution(yes evolution in everything - in the story, in characters, in fights, in techniques), I like new things...!
4. Emotions, Relationships 
5. Side Stories(yes side stories of other characters - they are really cool)
6. Memorable heroes and villains(yes though we have one main protagonist we have several side heroes and villains with their awesome stories)
7. Logic(logic in every Jutsu development, in every fight)
I've seen Anime with higher ratings but no logic in their battles, training.(IDK why people like something which doesn't support logic)
8. Explanation - everything is explained in detail.
9. Life Lessons - yeah I have learned so many things from this Anime characters.
Almost all characters are my favorite but the special ones are Itachi, Naruto, Nagato(Pain), Shisui, Orochimaru, Madara, All Hokages, I will never forget Akatsuki....they are amazing..!!
My most favorite episode is a filler....yes it's a filler, a filler in which writer expressed his views about the real world, real people, what it is to create and what it is to destroy, what is life, what is love, what is power? what we can do with our life and how we can be helpful to others!! So many things were just taught just in a single episode. The name of that episode is Ninja Creed.
There are so many things that I wanted to explain here but people will get bored of my review so I'm ending this here. 
Keep watching Naruto Shippuden coz anime is still going on and the rest of the episodes will amaze us just as the previous ones did.
Sayonara!!!",10

                I thought I'd write a Naruto review as unlike most Naruto fans I started late. Naruto was one of the first anime I watched, I was 21ish and I LOVED it, watching both series as quickly as possible.  The main issue with Shippuuden is the filler episodes (as I'm sure you've read) but luckily there is an easy fix. https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto-shippuden I would suggest reading episode descriptions of the fillers to see if you want to give them a shot. Some are super fun, there are a bunch set in the past about Kakashi and Minato and some in the allied war arc are interesting
                  and releventish, but of course they are fillers and naruto fillers tend to be on the painful side. My second problem with this series (acknowledging that japan sucks when it comes to representation) was the heteronormativity, at least in Boruto Orochimaru is upfront with being non-binary their son, but the way everyone gets paired off in painful to watch.
Why I still give this a 9/10 is the thoroughness of character development and the incredible animation and production style.  This world was built with such care that the creators of the anime were able to display an intricate storyline very clearly and in a way that leaves us with the best feeling.",9
"
                This is one anime you would not like to miss. Again the cons is at FILLERS. Just skip the fillers and enjoy the action. uh uh don't get the wrong idea! Naruto makes sure you have lots of laugh as well. Even as far as i have seen, some fillers are okay... or rather good.
The action is good , although the main protagonist is not very intelligent, but is headstrong, strong willed, having never-die spirit; hence does find a way to counter his foes. The emotional scenes are very nicely pictured especially with death of characters (unlike other animes people do die in here; that's
                  a good thing here). But some scenes have been over-dramatized a lot. Gives a really irritating feeling. But that is like 1% of it.
The  OST is awesome as well. Fills you up with energy and boosts your testosterone levels at the time of fights, plays really peaceful and warm music at normal times. The suspense is too good as well; you enver know what is gonna come and from where. Naruto shippuuden always will keep on surprising you. Overall it is a must watch for all anime lovers. 10/10",10
"
                What the haters don't understand is that fillers are not an indication of how good or bad an anime is, atleast not for me, let me just start out by saying that this story is a masterpiece, and it will remain so until the end of time it self, the naruto legacy will live on whether the haters like it or not, now that this series is over, people can watch it without the crappy fillers, some of the fillers are important but most are bad, so you can use an episode guide to figure out which ones to skip, watch this series by skipping
                  all the crappie fillers and you will see why this is one of the most popular franchises in history",9
"
                As Naruto leads into Naruto: Shippuuden I found that the story line became more focused and interesting. Far more character story lines are revealed where as before in Naruto it was mostly ""oh he's a ninja of the leaf"" and that's the most you got.
One massive pain with Naruto though is that episodes are dragged out, filled with flashbacks and long stare downs during battle scenes. There are also groups of 10-20 filler episodes within the main plot were ninja go on random missions. Maybe the creates just wanted to hit the next 100 episode mark... It's just not needed.
If you can look past all
                  of this though the story line and teachings of Naruto are very good, this is the main reason I continue to watch. Along with the lovable characters, animation and art work.
Overall Naruto: Shippuuden shows great improvement in story and character building which is why I scored it an 8.",8
"
                story-10
The story of Naruto Shippuden for me is one of the best written shounen anime out there. The naruto story makes use of a lot of great symbolism and foreshadowing. one thing that makes the naruto anime much better than most other shounen anime is the fact that the story is unpredictable and has many plot twists. the only major downside to the naruto shippuden anime is the fact that is has 219 filler episodes this is about 44% of the series and with the filler not being very good it is enough to put people of from watching the series. one thing the naruto
                  series does brilliantly is make the viewers like the villains of the series and most people will even agree with their philosophy and their take on the world. the show dives into many different themes such as human instinct, self sacrifice, the cycle of hatred and discrimination, the naruto series handles these themes very well.
Characters-10
The characters in the naruto shippuden anime is one of its biggest selling points with the majority of the cast being great well written characters that most of the fans really like. each character in the series is very unique and this is something that kishimoto does brilliantly as most of the cast's philosophy's differ from one another. the villains in the story are very unique as they aren't evil just for the sake of it. the villains all have their own unique philosophy's in the naruto series. characters like Itachi and Kakashi are some of the best written characters in anime.
Art/Animation-8
the animation in naruto shippuden is very consistent and is pretty good. but the art style is decent but its pretty simple and sometimes it lets down the great animation of the series, an example of this is the naruto vs pain fight as it was animated very well but let down by the art work for it. but overall the art and animation of naruto is good
Soundtrack-10
the soundtrack in the naruto series is top tier, the majority of the cast has amazing themes and the general ost for the series is great as the music goes well with whats happening in the show. the ost allows the anime to show the emotions it wants too because of this.
Overall Enjoyment- 10
overall naruto shippuden is a very fun and enjoyable experience as it has so many great elements to it, its a very emotionally attaching series as most people that watch the series get drawn to the characters. i think this show is very good and i would highly recommend it. it is great in both dub and sub but its a better experience in sub.",10
"
                To late but i need this anime up for value, At least for 0.01% to 8.15
You just can't say anything bad in this anime. Because this anime will teach you how to love, to value your friends, and many other Nintendo that really reflect on the real world. It's fiction, but it's as powerful as it gets...to reach a fanbase of millions and millions worldwide.
'The Crafting'
Such positive, critical response isn't questionable. The story lives up to his promise to live as long as fifteen years (in whole). It is a burning legacy. It is something no one will ever come up again. Watch Boruto: Naruto
                  Next Generations, or various recent Shippuden fillers (Season 5 was said to be the best, and indeed it was [Guren arc.], and you'll know that there will be no other Masashi Kishimoto. Or so I thought. Naruto is an original artwork. For since little of age, Kishi after watching 'Akira' got inspired and once upon a time decided how much he loved to draw and make a story. That story has changed my life; it made me really believe on the fact that some inspirations, tend to grow out on us, live like scars, and will teach us something that will only come from us. A life lesson. A burning 'will of fire'.
It's really stupendous and beyond overwhelming how one man could create an entire universe of action, of tell-tale hearts, of characters that have devil wings but in the end are shown to have a halo. Hundred thousands of fanfictions are up there on the net, extending what Kishimoto left. I included, but let's not get onto that first.

"
                What could I possibly say about this amazing franchise called naruto and naruto shippuden. This anime is great from the music to the characters and the animetion ok overall it has some filler in it but you can skip it so I don't consider it a problem. The reasons I loved this series are a lot. 1 Naruto teaches you never to give up on something you want to achieve that inspired me in some real life moments, 2 the story was fun happy and sad literally naruto could make me cry sometimes or others super hyped or laughing a lot and lastly 3 the
                  characters. We see naruto and friends get older from kids to teenagers and in the end adults that make me so attached to them at a point when someone die i would feel like I am losing an old friend and now let's talk villains. Akatsuki is a great group of villains they are cool scary and mysterious ( especially ""tobi"") they had so many great members and each on had his own backstory from the tragic and cool Pain and Itachi to Deidara Sasori etc. Now I am gonna close this review saying that YOU should watch Naruto shipuden it is one of the best shonen series and the last fight in the end is really worth it.",10
"
                Although I have not viewed even half of this anime I believe the thoughts and words I have to say are strong and justified. I have gotten watched through the pain arch and it has proved to be a very pivotal moment for my understanding of this show. Whenever Naruto is brought up people often bring up the fact that its laced with filler or other pointless qualities that would degrade the quality of the show. Talk to me about filler before I have seen this arch and I would have agreed but with where I am now I wholeheartedly believe everything this show has
                  done is justified; regardless of how drawn out segments of the show can tend to be. You can only get as much from this series as you are willing to get from it, thus if you want to achieve the most intense take away from this there must be a method to the madness. I believe the best approach is through marathoning significant moments from the series because everything builds. Watching this show has made me finally understand why English teachers love analyzing literature. Its not about the spectacular fight scenes its about the message this show sends to its viewers. The bigger picture this show has to offer is all to relevant to this time period and my interpretation has allowed me to fully appreciate anime of this caliber as a whole. For example they manage to give almost all the core villains fully justified means of their actions. There is so much more to speak of but I feel this is a path of self discovery and I am fully interested in unique thoughts about this show as a whole. To those on the outside it seems like I'm drawing blood from a stone. But lemme tell ya I found a whole lot of blood.",10
"
                As one of the best known works of all time. Naruto has one of the biggest fanbases and is certainly one of the biggest animes in the world. I loved it as a child, it was my favorite anime with Dragon Ball. But for a criticism, I have to be a critic, with countless fillers and holes in the story, Kishimoto didn't know how to manage such a large work. His last arc as an ending took so long, that I broke my fingers from skipping the filler episode so much. In the middle of a war, putting filler is nothing, with Naruto doing shit
                  I don't like in the anime. Whoever watches the complete anime after being old, realizes how badly managed the work was. An anime that I consider and a lot, but the only way to find this anime perfect, is either not understanding anything, or is to love blindly. For consideration, I leave a note of 5. History and development 2. Because in Shippuden the only thing I heard was Naruto and Sasuke, they shit for the other characters; An anime that doesn't develop the other characters, for me, loses half the note. Grade 5, Development 2 and History 4.",5
"
                i loved the series as a whole the characters had good development but some really wierd moments where they just say fuck it this guy is good now while he´s been the bad guy for 3 seasons but it was great and i had a lot of fun with it 
i watched till episode 393 and ended up dropping it because when you,ve been waiting for a long time throw a bat twist on the series and end a battle with a cliffhanger and follow up with a bunch of filler i,ve had enough ep 0-300 was great but after that it started to annoy
                  me i stopped watching so i wouldnt ruin  the show for myself cause in my eyes it just bought a plane ticket on the german airline that crashed yesterday",8
"
                Naruto is a long drawn out tale full of adventure and an enormous set of characters. The show has its goods and its bads, unfortunately the bads outweigh the good.. greatly, but even then it does serve its purpose in the anime world.
Naruto at its core is a pretty bland show. It came about to bank on the power trip stories that came out of Dragon Ball Z. Bleach, One piece are all reminiscent of what Dragon Ball Z was. A guy overcoming unrealistic challenges to attain his goal, they are always invincible, any damage is always fixable, in any encounter you KNOW they will
                  come out on top because that is how the show runs. It is a predictable heap of shit. 
Banking on the DBZ sentiment is not bad though, look at Avatar, it is not an anime but it is inspired by anime. Avatar does something all those shonen fail at, Avatar knows what it is and it does not choke on itself. Naruto and majority of other shonen try really hard to be mature and deep. The problem with this is that what they deem to be deep and mature are really not it.  Avatar knows it is for kids, it isn't a try hard show biting more than it can chew. You want gritty and deep and mature go somewhere else. You want a show pretending to be mature and act tough like a 16 year old teen then this is it. 
I mentioned the show has its place. That is correct, it has a place among the younger audience and it is expected that as you grow older you get tired of this shit and grow the fuck up. Don't be one of those 20-30 year old youtubers commenting every week on the new episode release of naruto, it is really sad. 
So in the end I'll say this: 
Watch Naruto, watch it alot, have your fill. Use it to refine your taste and branch off from there to anime that is less shit. 
story: 3
pretty shit story, this story has been done a number of times, watch something else. It is repetitive and gives a rosy false view to kids. FRIENDSHIP WON""T PAY YOUR BILLS OR GET YOU INTO SCHOOL, IT WON'T BRING YOU BACK FROM THE DEAD. We get it naruto, you love your friends, please calm the fuck down. In life people come and go, no one is here to stay and eventually we all will die. we all have our reasons for hating someone or for being bad to someone, sasuke did too and no amount of beating him to death will make him good. GIVE THE KID SOME COUNSELING HIS FAMILY DIED. If anything Naruto teaches kids to beat their friends up in frustration for not having the same opinion, instead of sitting with them and asking how they feel.
Art: 7 Not bad
Sound: 7 Not bad, pretty good opening and closing music
Characters: 3 Blander than white people food
Enjoyment: 6 I was a kid gimme a break
Overall: 4 Fucking stupid",4
"
                Plot: So Naruto basically takes place in an alternate world where the Hokage is like the president and this young boy who is an outcast wants to be the Hokage so he can be accepted and people can look at him as a hero. Meanwhile (In shippuden) a group called the akatsuki come in and basically start up a war. Also Naruto is also training his hardest so he can ""rescue"" his friend Sauske. Sorry for the crappy summery and yes I know theres already a summery. Anyway so I can understand why Naruto is so determined to be Hokage but at least every couple
                  episode the creators always make sure to stick it in your face ""Naruto was a loser"". But my biggest pet peeve about the show, the thing I just cannot stand (thats not fillers) Is sauske. Why would you try and save a friend who doesn't even need saving? I found it just pointless If Sauske wanted to come back to the hidden leaf, he can do it on his own.
Art & Sound: Honestly I loved the voices of every character and the art style was pretty good too. I have no complaints here
Characters: Alright so we got Loveable yet annoying Naruto Believe it then we got useless and lets face it desperate sakura, we got ""Cool guy"" and sometimes a jerk Sauske. We got extremely loveable kakashi. And thats about it 
Enjoyment: Despite everything I've said, I loved Naruto. it was a nice anime. However there were just a couple of things that just annoyed me, as stated above. Sorry if this wasn't a good review :D",8
"
                Oh dear, where do I begin?
Okay, the first few arcs weren't too bad. We have a few decent storyarcs with a few alright filler arcs in between, that don't actually seem like fillers. Well, they kinda do, but they have their own intriguing stories. In the Wikia, it now splits some of the arcs so those unfamiliar to the listing (e.g. 'Itachi Pursuit' once featured the hunt for Itachi as well as stories revolving around him and Jiraiya's battle) will be confused (like I was just now!). Even the back-story featuring Jiraiya, and the Kakashi Gaiden adaptation was amazing to watch.
Like Part 1, Shippuden features
                  updated art, but it is still ugly in areas (have you seen the background ninja - who drew them?). 
The sound is pretty much the only thing that's going for the anime at the moment. The emotional openings and endings are still something I'm interested in.
I know this is entirely to do with Kishimoto, but at least give Ten Ten some non-filler character development! She's worse than Sakura! Ten Ten only has development in the filler.
The worst thing about the anime is the fillers. Yes, I said it. The fillers since the War arcs have all flashed back from before the War, and currently do not serve a purpose within the anime. At the end of 2015, there are only eight canon episodes. Where one of the main conclusions of the manga feature, instead there is no end of fillers - and as far as we can tell, none in January either - I'm looking at animefillerlist.com at the moment.
Do yourselves a favour and read the manga if you haven't. It's not much better, though.
If Naruto had an entire reboot away from Studio Pierrot, the fillers should be rewritten and classified as 'canon', and then the fillers are in their original places (so that they follow along in chronological order as to not confuse fans and keep the dynamic of the War arcs going).",4
"
                the reason why I love this anime Naruto resolve the problem with not to fight all out. but with talking.and pierrot has adopted naruto manga became an anime serie very well. was broadcast as many as 461 eps in tv tokyo.do not you see? the frame of animation is very soft for this animation with the total of hundreds episodes like now.while fairy tail with the total of hundreds episodes is not as soft as naruto.we should thank to studio pierrot.do not you remember the epic episode?
shikamaru,kakashi,ino,kiba vs kakuzu and hidan.
itachi vs sasuke
team sasuke vs killer bee
naruto kyuubi vs pain
chiyo and sakura vs sasori
kakashi vs
                  obito
general that epic scenes only for animation totaling around 20 or 13 episodes.and studio pierrot made hundreds episodes of naruto shippuden with a very soft quality
minato dan kushina vs kyuub (sad scene)
and before the death of itachi. the frame of animation its so soft.
.we should thank to the animators at studio pierrot, because they have made this animation frame is so very soft. even the A-1 pictures studio who mad fairy tail with hundreds eiposdes it is not soft as naruto. just see a simple simple movement like walking and hitting and you
You will know the difference between fairy tail and naruto.if you're an 2D traditional animator you will really understand the difference. you have to watch anime about how to making anime ''shirobako''.the core of all I mean is pierrot studio has adapted Naruto animation with quality as good as the animation of numbered a dozens episodes. although Naruto has hundreds eps now. imagine how many frames are created by the animators?
and this is not about a comparison between the story of fairy tail and naruto.it's about the quality of the animation movement. you have to watch anime about how to making anime ''shirobako''. if you're an 2D traditional animator you will really understand the difference.",8
"
                Naruto as a series, is an incredibly complicated masterpiece. Assuming the person reading this has first finished the original Naruto series of our blond haired hero in his trademark Orange tracksuit, I will give a quick summary of some of the critiques I have of this series and what to look forward to in this next amazing sequel.
First of all, the soundtrack remains iconic and amazing. The openings remain  catchy and the soundtrack is both epic and marvelous. It tends to move away from the very fast-paced Japanese sounding instrumentals of the first series and enters into hymn and choir territory, especially with relevance
                  to characters of God-like status relating to the plotline.
Naruto shippuden is a very lore based series, and relates more towards philosophy and morality then the first series ever did. The battles are long, the speeches are longer. I assume Creator Kishimoto wanted his viewers to age up with the anime, beginning to question things they never did as a child. Therefore, expect the anime to become very complex and confusing at some points.
Unfortunately, The loveable Konoha  side characters that we independently learned and watched fight in the Chuunin exams and Sasuke retrieval Arc have a lesser role in the sequel. New characters and plot lines are introduced and many shinobis are cast to the side lines. The sequel is very much about focusing Sasuke and Naruto's bond and Naruto's own personal character development..
 I would argue that  the young shinobis still have much relevance, but less screen time in the main storyline as it progresses.
The meme of 'NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARUTOOOOOOO' and 'SASUUUUUUUUUUKEH' is pretty much relevant to the series as Naruto fights further to bring Sasuke back to the village. ^_^
The new characters, especially the Akatsuki characters throughout the story, are super interesting and unique, so look out for them. They are all powerful individual shinobi with incredibly unique designs and jutsus. I found them to be the most enjoyable of the series and I hope the reader does too!
Naruto Shippuden may not have the carefree, often comedic,  nostalgic attitude of the first series main storyline, but it still provides a much enjoyable series and definitely a fantastic must see sequel to the first series to finally get a sense of closure.
I have repeatedly stated the 'main storyline' through out this review, because if you thought the fillers of the first series was bad after the Sasuke retrieval arc...then I have news for you. There is a lot of filler. If you only care about the story and not the alternative universes or random plot lines, you may want to stick to the main story line and skip the filler episodes, however some of the fillers I'd suggest keeping a look out for - especially the alternative universe ones, as they give an interesting opposite perspective to the main canon universe. Just try not to get jealous if the alternative universe seems more...idealic then the real world, blood thirsty shinobi world..that was my trap of watching them! I wanted things to be different! ^_^''
I hope you enjoy Naruto as much as the rest of us do, and watch our snarky, smart-mouthed Kyuubi protagonist manifest and develop into an amazing, strong-willed character with all his comrades behind him as he fights for what he believes to be right and true. Dattebayo!",8
"
                  IS THIS ANIME TIME EFFICIENT ?
  NO. NOT AT ALL; BUT LET ME SAY THIS...
  I ask myself what makes these kind of animes so valuable to me. This anime is nowhere near perfect. Answer is actually pretty clear. I am a viewer who can put his time on this long series and enjoy it. So if you can relate to what I am saying, I can ensure you that this show has the most epic scenes in the world.
It all comes down to the person who watches. This anime is not for everyone. But those who finished it know how
                  they fucking enjoyed the boner they got when Guy and Madara fought. What I am trying to say is, this show pays off when you put your time on it. Just like other episodic series.",10
"
                A very interesting and very original story, it has many values ​​and teachings, its animation is very good at the moment, much better since its emission, its soundtracks are beautiful and magnificent, of the best that you can get to listen.The characters are very original, although some have more prominence than others as usually happens in all anime, the secondary are not so forgotten.I recommend it, you will like it very much, easily this among the best shonen animes, and personally it is my favorite without doubt, that if you do not like the fill just skip it and end the problem. (But not all
                  fillers are bad, some are a work of art like ""Chikara"") Very epic.",10
"
                Story 8/10 - As many have already pointed out, the sheer amount of fillers and flashbacks, boy! They're unbearable. But thanks to fan-made Naruto Kai, pacing should no longer be an issue now.
Still, can't afford tens of hours? Watch the entire show at 1.7x speed then! If you're a native Japanese speaker like me, you should have no problem keeping up.
Some of the arcs like Pain's arc had a deep & profound philosophical theme and I loved it. Had it not for the pacing, I would've given 10/10, but alas.
________
Art 6/10 - I had to drop the show for 2 years because of the art-style.
                  The change from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden certainly requires a bit of getting used to.
Picking it back up after two years, everything looked so much better for some reason. But still, it's by no means perfect or even good.
The animation on the other hand was outstanding, especially battle scenes.
________
Sound 10/10 - To be honest I didn't care about the OPs & EDs. But that's just because I'm not into Jpop (atm). They're by no means bad, though.
The voice actings were superb. The casts were amazing. LOVED the background music! - 10/10
________
Character 10/10 - Masashi Kishimoto is a genius at making characters loveable. Gotta love the easy to remember simple character names & their unique quirks. Most characters had a pure heart, and that's what drew me in. - 10/10
________
Enjoyment 10/10 - As I said, watch the Kai version at 1.7x speed and you'll enjoy every minute of it!
________
Overall 10/10 - I always preferred One Piece over Naruto, I even fought my college friends over it, but after finishing the series today, well what can I say, I've finally experienced the change of heart. Lol.
Naruto is now one of my all-time favorites - Take my 10/10!!",10
"
                this will be short and sweet. I don't write reviews but naruto having so many 10's really gets to me. The overlaying story is very well done(for the most part). the art, i like(unlike some younger people used to way different quality). Sound is on point. Unique and impactful. That being said, everything else about the show is mediocre at best. The characters advance, but done actually DEVELOP, with the exception of naruto and sasuke(i'll give you shikimaru as well i suppose). Sakura learns to fight, and then barely does. everyone else has basically a static personality that may change a little bit, but then
                  goes back to as it was. This show, along with bleach, are what i call failed potential. Great premises, could go so far, but seems to fall short due to filler and mediocre character development. I will say the show is enjoyable, but come prepared with a filler guide and if your anything like me, u can watch naruto and around 100 episodes of shippuden before you feel it's worth watching. as for me it was the first death involving an akatsuki attack(if you've watched, you know who) that finally made the show seem to have some form of realism and depth and frankly it shouldnt have taken that long. If a 12 episode anime with a crappy story can make me cry, why did it 300+ for shippuden to illicit a similar response? If you read this, thank you and i encourage you to watch the show, as it lasted for a reason, even if i feel it fell short of its mark.",5

** I review for the 3 category as one segment because they correlate with each other **
*****
*) The basic synopsis of the story is about the grown up Naruto, the same Naruto from the Anime of the same title ""Naruto"".
*) It's about the progress of Naruto's life story, development, and his thorough background.
*) Since Naruto in ""Naruto Shippuden"" is the grown up version of ""Naruto"", then his progress story is very deep and very thorough.*) So deep even that it overshadowed other characters within this series.
*****
*) Other supporting characters which have a lot of role and a lot of part during the ""Naruto"" first anime lost its role and play a very minor part in ""Naruto Shippuden"".
*) Take a look at Neji for example.
*) During the first ""Naruto"" he is one of the most active supporting character and offer a lot of role and part during the story arcs and many of the fights.
*) But Neji's part in Naruto Shippuden"" becomes very insignificant and it is fairly to said that he has no major role at all during this series.
*) The only significance his role has to offer is only in season 1, the ""Kazekage Rescue"" arc.
*) Other than that, his role just disappears.
*****
*) The sad thing is, Neji is not the only one who lost his role in this series.
*) Other active supporting characters like Kiba, Rock Lee, and many others who were once very active during the first ""Naruto"", lost its significance in ""Shippuden"".
*) They rarely make any appearance, even though they made an appearance in the series, their function is nothing more than just a ""figurine"" or ""cameo"" with no real action or involve in any fight.
*) And even they involve in any fight, they only just involve in a few minutes tops.
*) In other word, they become more and more un-important for this series.
*) And I think it is such a big lost because during the first ""Naruto"", they offer much role during the story arcs and much action.
*) The only way you could see them in action more than any other is through fillers, but then again, fillers never have any significance to the main chain of the story arc and are highly ""skip-able"".
*****
*) Now comes the really big question: If those characters become very insignificant, then which characters have the most highlight?
*) Well duh, none other than Naruto himself.
*) The main protagonist from the first ""Naruto"", which is Naruto, Kakashi, Sasuke, and Sakura have shifted to Naruto, Kakashi, Yamato (just 3 of them).
*) Now the series focused heavily on those 3, Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato.
*) They involve in almost EVERY fight, they involve in almost EVERY story arcs, etc. etc.
*****
*) If ""Naruto"" didn't have a vast cast of characters, the when the series focused heavily on 3 characters it wouldn't be a problem.
*) But ""Naruto"" has a vast cast of characters.
*) If such vastness of character cast is being narrowed down into just 3 characters, then other characters become a waste, which is very unfortunate and disappoints fans of the other characters.
*****
*) The first season (the Kazekage Rescue arc) has very much to offer.
*) A lot of martial art ninja-thingy fights with very minimum intermezzo during the fights just for ""technical discussion"" and/ or ""background story telling"".
*) But after that, it's all going down hill.
*) Season 2 has a very slow story pacing, too much to talk and too much to discuss, less fighting, and it's the first season to focus heavily on the main 3 characters, Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato.
*) From thereon, the story focuses heavily on Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato.
*) And after season 1, you will encounter a lot of repetitive talk discussing the same topic for over and over and over again.
*) Such repetitive definitely destroy the pacing of the story into a very sloooooow pace.
*) Why waste a lot of repetitive discussion while we could understand the essence of the story just from ONE TIME discussion?
*) Waste of time, and definitely waste of episode numbers.
*) No wonder ""Shippuden"" has 280+ episodes and still counting, nearing to no end.
*****
*) Another item that causes the pacing to be slow is too much prolix for any scene.
*) For example, let say someone has a dying scene, and has a last word to his/ her dear ones.
*) For the first 3 or 4 sentences (less then 1 minute), the last word and the dying scene was very emotional and endearing.
*) But when the last word becomes a last ""speech"" that last for around 5 minutes of talk, then the scene becomes boring and becomes sloooooow, making us want to skip the scene and fast forward because after the first 3 or 4 sentences, the scene becomes ""oh enough already!"".
*****
*) The action is spectacular, even it offers a lot of ""coolness"" than the first ""Naruto"".
*) But just like its predecessor, many of the fights being inserted with ""technical discussions"" to discuss the technique / jutsu being used, and/ or inserted with ""background story"" to discuss the characters past.
*) Such insertion destroys the mood-o'-meter of the audience.
*) Any fighting scene offers a very height of mood ""Excitement"".
*) But any insertion of the ""technical discussion"" and/ or ""background story"" just throw a ""wet blanket"" to our ""fiery"" excitement mood into a sad or ""thinking"" mood.
*) What worse is that sometime ""background story"" wastes 2 or 3 episodes.
*) And even after the 2 or 3 episodes of ""background story"", still the characters tell the story AGAIN during any fight.
*) It's an un-necessary repetitive for something that ""we get it"" from the first time.
*) Still has the same problem with the mood-o'-meter as in the first ""Naruto"".
*****
*) Another similarity that ""Shippuden"" shares with the first ""Naruto"" is the endless fillers.
*) Fillers, fillers, fillers, even during the main story arc, the still have the time to insert 1 or 2 episodes of fillers.
*) Fillers have never been had any significance in the main chain of the saga/ story, so therefore skip-able.
*) But with lots of lots of fillers (I lost count), we will have skip-able episodes and un-necessary additions to the series.
*****
*) As the story progressed, the fighting and the jutsu becomes more and more about trading magic attacks.
*) It lost it souls as a ""Ninja"" and as a ""Martial Artist"".
*) The magic just being called ""jutsu"" to make it sound like a ninja-thingy, but the essence is still ""magic"" fights and not a ""ninja-martial-art"" fights.
*****
*) With 280+ episodes and counting, nearing to no end, it seems that the creator of this series doesn't want for ""Naruto"" to end.
*) Therefore, throughout the series, we will see A LOT of story branching that never before was a story.
*) Story branching creates a very un-focused story and stray away from the basic story writing of ""stick to the main story"".
*) For example SPOILER ALERT..... you will see the connection between Jiraiya and Pain.
*) During the first ""Naruto"" and during the first few seasons of ""Shippuden"", there was never any story between Jiraiya and Pain.
*) But when the character Pain becomes the center of main antagonist during the series, then the writer created a story connection to Jiraiya.
*) This definitely de-rail and stray the character story ""Jiraiya"" from the story line that he already has. 
*) Jiraiya is not the only one, you will see many other characters that being de-rail-ed and strayed from the main story they already have.
*) In some cases being added another story and added another, making the story becomes more branched and de-rail-ed and stray from the main story line.
*) Thus causing watching ""Shippuden"" to be having no different experience than having the experience of watching a ""telenovela"" or ""Desperate Housewives"", with all the de-rail-ing, straying, branching story line, and keep adding up story line.
*****
*) The most notable de-rail-ing and straying story line is the de-rail-ing main story of Naruto's dream of becoming Hokage just like in the first ""Naruto"" AND the ""pursue Sasuke"" story line.
*) The story becomes very de-rail-ed and becomes very stray from the ""dreaming to become Hokage"" and ""pursue Sasuke"", because in ALL of those seasons, you will note that you will meet A LOT of story branching and additions, thus the ""dreaming to become Hokage"" and ""pursue Sasuke"" become ""Lost its meaning"" by it self.
*) Making the story just un-focused and never reach any real conclusion.
*****
*) Therefore, with such:
+ Positive+
+ Cool action and (kinda) fast pace fighting in season 1, season 6, and season ""invasion of pain arc"";
+ Fighting scenes are faster pace than the first ""Naruto"", but NOT in every season, only several seasons;
+ Deep story line for the mature Naruto.
- Negative -
- Wasting much of the vast character's potential;
- Too much focus on a very narrow main protagonist from a vast characters;
- Repetitive story telling;
- Inappropriate insertion of ""technical discussion"" and/ or ""background story"" during a fight that destroys our mood-o'-meter;
- Sloooow pacing story line;
- Stray away from its soul story as a ""ninja"" fighting;
- Too much de-rail-ing, straying, and branching of the story just like telenovela.
- Too much fillers, AGAIN.
The grade falls at 5 for all the Story, Character, and Enjoyment because the Negatives out weights the Positives.

                Let's say you're looking for something to be your first anime and you like fighting, well naruto is your thing.
This anime has it all there is a little romance there is some action there is character growth there is an interesting power system however the anime is very slow in a normal anime an Arc of naruto would be 12 episodes it is purposely extended to make viewers anticipate the next one more and more and want to watch the next episode. So back on topic naruto is for newbies because once you look naruto the other anime will seem a lot faster and be
                  more to your interests i.e. the anime itself might be 5/10(personal opinion not a fan) however it's worth it for the consequences.",5
"
                this is an awesome anime, especially if you liked the original naruto. anyways, you cant watch the first naruto series without seeing this one, because it would be incomplete! the only thing i absolutely dislike is THE FILLERS!! but i bear them, and continue on with the story. hope you like!
              ",9
"
                I dont know what to say about this anime adaptation, I have just too many mixed feelings about this, on one hand I believe naruto's plot is esentially the most amazing plot ever but I MUST give the story a 7 just becuse of the filler episodes which werent all that awful, I did like like.. 2? out of what? 100? they are awful, for real the worst torture ever was to wait every week for a new chapter just to get a filler episode.. I skipped 99% of them and I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to see them, they are a waste of time,
                  so you can just go to wikipedia, locate those filler episodes and skip them. Filler episodes are just like naruto's movies; too under quality compared to the actual plot episodes.
For the art, this DESERVES a 3. Why on earth would anyone let this mediocre studio get the anime adapation of such a masterpiece? come on, I did laugh at the art on most chapters but that shouldn't be the point.. compared to the manga and from a real fan who has followed naruto for 10 years literally the art makes you wanna cry. I personally can't stand bad art animes but I did stand naruto's only because of its overall masterpiece storyline (that's a good point somehow I guess)
Sound is amazing, it has the best sountrack in matter of openings and endings to me at least, I do love them all and they all make me feel really emotional, the ost is also nice, it gets you into the ninja atmposphere, it's really accurate.
Naruto has one of the most wonderful characters ever made. Its length also gives space for these characters to be amazingly good developed, in my opinion naruto's characters are the best part from the whole anime adaptation/manga. Chapters dedicated to them actually make you understand even the bad ones and you may be able to love most of them, with all their individual storylines which are outstanding. Best character development out of all anime industry in my opinion.
It has an awful end which I'm not gonna spoil and that's the only reason I give it an overall 8 instead of a 10 (even when considering art and filler episodes I should probably be harsher) just because its good stuff is just too good. 100% recommend watching, just skip filler episodes and don't expect a thing out of the art.",8
"
                This is so much better than Naruto guys. This is a whole other level than that and it deserves your time. Here's why:
Story: 10 
This show doesn't have an over arching goal like many anime do (Hunter x Hunter 2011 or One piece for example) but it just a story of a boy growing up and maturing into one of the finest shinobi and coming into contact with the problems of the world he lives in. He meets people and gets help and guidance along the way while becoming more and more reliable and powerful. It really is awesome.
Art: 9
I love the art and the
                  theme it gives the show is great. The only reason this isnt a 9 is it can get sloppy at times, especially during fights which really angers me at times but usually it is great.
Sound: 9
Though sometimes is can be a bit cheesy I absolutely love the soundtrack of this show as well as the original Naruto soundtrack. 
Character:10
Some of the strongest parts of the show are seeing the connections Naruto creates with others and seeing his relationship build with the people closest to him. You really really feel his development as a leader, fighter, and thinker in this show and are cheering for him every step of the way. He isn't a spazzy annoying kid anymore and you really see that. Progression of characters is show as the theme of generations is really stressed and the youth inherit the world from the old and children become their parents etc. It is a fantastic theme.
Enjoyment: 9
The fights in this show are awesome and the new powers and villains are some of the best parts of this show. My single character villain ever is in this show. Guess who it is I bet it won't be that hard haha. This show makes you run in circles going ""DAMNNNNN"" and also can make you tear up a bit and make sure no one sees. 
Overall:9 
It isn't a masterpiece, but it is damn close and by no means a waste of time for anyone. Go watch this show. Especially if you have scene Naruto and think their world of jutsu is interesting then this will be a great use of your time. I watched it twice already and it was just as good the second time (skip the fillers though honestly).",9
"
                In my opinion, this is by far the best anime ive watched.I just can't get enough of it.
( No Spoilers Ahead )
This anime is overall a perfect 10. It has awesome fighting scenes that makes you wish you were ninja. Action, drama, and comedy fall perfectly in this anime. Naruto shippuden is so beautiful to me, it makes me cry, laugh, and feel inspired. YES, this show is pretty kick ass with ninjas but this show can be sad at times. This show has alot of meaning.
Story- it begins with 3 main story's and they are all carried out through the series. The show makes
                  sure to explain everything so your not lost. Everything seems to be connected to each story, so it's not like the story's is nonsense and irreverent. Everything links up so good.
Sound- Naruto shippuden has an awesome OST soundtrack. Songs match up with the characters and situations emotions. Intro songs are so good that I download some to my phone. They always switch up the music so you get to listen and find new songs.
Charterers- each character has a story, and these story's are fill with such meaning. Each character will teach you a meaning or even a lesson. Charterers are all different with their own personality's. These characters have special bonds with each other and you can actually  grasp onto those bonds and relationships.
Naruto shippuden and the character himself will teach you to never give up and never give up on the people you love you will experience determinations and sorrow in this anime.",10
"
                F****** S Tier anime. I don't have to say anything else or explain myself. The War arc and the Pain Assault arc were some of the best arcs I've ever seen in anime. Although, I don't really like the last ending of the War arc, kinda like the Espada Arc in Bleach, I love the arc, but I don't like the ending. It started off with a bang, although, the Kazekage Rescue arc was pretty slow, it hurt me so ending hurt me so hard, I was balling. Everything about this Anime is nothing short of S Tier, besides the filler. If we include the
                  filler, it's more like an 8 or 9, but no filler, 10/10, no questions asked.",10
"
                Naruto is the franchise that will always have a special place in my heart. And no, it is not the nostalgia bias of the fact that it's been on the screen for over 15 years. I used to be one of the guys who were making fun of the show before even watching a single episode, just by looking at the cover and supposing stuff. Before jumping to the critical assessment, I would like to say a few words about how this creation has helped me in so many ways, besides offering so much enjoyment. 
After surviving a terrible experience which literally has almost killed
                  me, I started to feel empty and I completely forgot who I am. Due to being bored I decided to give a shot to this show. It didn't impress me that much straight away, but after a long time, it made me finally feel something in the very first episode. I cannot describe the whole process detail by detail, and it wasn't easy at all, but after more than a year I feel like myself again. It wasn't only about watching the show, it was the fact that the show gave me hope and helped me find the courage to start living again. I went to the craziest journey of my life, studying in a foreign country and I just successfully finished my first year, doing what I love. The way Naruto represents our raw reality with all the harsh elements and feelings in such a positive way is absolutely magical and I cannot describe using words how much that meant for me and how grateful I am. I will do my best to not allow my words to get biased at all and provide you with an appropriate review.
Naruto has first appeared on the western screens at the beginning of the XXI century, 2002 till 2007, where the story will transit to the new series, Naruto Shippuuden. The latter is the most exciting part of the story and contains the biggest amount of findings and the crazy action we are all rooting for. It is also offering us a proper ending to the primary plot of the story. The two series are made up of 720 episodes(about 300 fillers, most of them enjoyable) and there are 10 separate movies to watch besides, plus a considerable amount of OVAs. All of them are adapted after Masashi Kishimoto s manga and the few graphic novels he's created.
Story(10): Naruto is the story of a little goofy boy who has always been alone and who decides that he will make people accept him and his power by becoming the Hokage(the strongest ninja in the village). His parents are dead, and almost everyone in the village hates him because of the monster that has been sealed within him. One day, somebody finally accepts him and a bond is being created between the two. That is just the beginning, as Naruto is willing to do his best and overcome every obstacle, to achieve his dream, never giving up on his precious smile that will leave a mark everywhere he goes. Is he going to achieve that dream? It's up to you to find that out by watching his journey. The world of shinobi is slowly attracted to war as a mysterious organisation called Akatsuki is threatening the world through its actions. It is a story about overcoming pain and hatred, a story about development and sacrifices, a story about the importance of friendship and dedication. The story of the boy who has promised since long ago that he is never going to go back on his word because that's his ninja way. All of these presented in a very well structured fictional world which contains plenty of secrets to be revealed. There is also the chakra system, a power that has got its own story as well, a power that can be used in combat by shinobi who are using the specific hand signs. Even though this element sounds very science fiction, or might even sound childish, the world is very reality-like. Different lands governed by chosen leaders and military systems. This world isn't hiding the harsh truth and the atrocities that are being committed throughout the story and all people actually have real personalities and interests. Everyone is aware of the danger and the sadness that is being spilt alongside with the blood of the shinobi. I would describe this whole story and the fictional universe as an explosion of feelings. What makes this story so great is the deep way in which it is presented to us.
The structure of the show(8): This is made up by the storytelling and the way the events are structured throughout the show.
The storytelling leaves no expectations as everything is presented in the most enjoyable order with additional flashbacks, which help you to understand better the reasons behind an action or a result. You're not missing any of the great battles that happened in the past since all of them are being shown at the right time, and will make you feel lucky for not seeing it before.
When it comes to the way the events are introduced, there is a problem with the big amount of fillers. Most of them are enjoyable, representing short breaks from the real deal, introducing you extra stuff that happened in the past, extra build-up, extra missions and sometimes parodies. The problem is when the fillers are being introduced right after an epic moment that cuts your breath. Just imagine seeing the most crucial battle and the next episode is a parody that slashes all of your hype down. I recommend you to skip the 376 and 377 episodes when you get there, you can watch them later, after you properly watch the whole important thing. Also, a few important events are being adapted into movies and OVAs and you need to be aware of that in order to not lose any information before proceeding further.
Characters(10): This fictional universe is filled with all sorts of characters that demonstrate their importance at some point. We get character development for almost everyone. Characters can jump from being a fan favourite to being hated by the audience and then jump back into their old shoes. Characters can and do change throughout the series, demonstrating that everyone can fall in the darkness and also that it is never too late to accept your mistakes and start all over again. And then we have the character Naruto, who is doing his best to break through everything he encounters without forgetting his promise and the people in his life. Every character has got a story to tell and stuff to teach, and we are exploring their lives in deep detail, revealing their reasons, their motivations, their aspirations, and so you easily come to an understanding of the character beyond the terms good and evil, breaking through the illusions.
Visuals and animation(10): Since the anime starts pretty long ago, it is obvious that the old graphics will seem a bit uncool at the beginning, but as the show is proceeding, the art becomes much more appealing to the eye, even tot he point where you'll fall in love with the visuals. The Kishimoto style has totally impressed me. 
Same development with the animation, which is sick in battles and very smooth. Together, they are bringing this wonderful universe to life on our screens in the most appropriate way.
Sound(10): There is no contest here. Naruto OSTs are the best I've ever heard in anime and not only. The music selected for the openings and endings is always on point with the animations and with the story progress. You're gonna have lots of new material for your playlist. Japanese music is sick. In concordance with everything this show is promoting, there is absolutely no contest when we are talking about the sound of Naruto. OSTs that are gonna make you weep while experiencing the lonely life of Naruto or the death of an important character that you loved. OSTs that will turn battles into the straight fire. OSTs that are gonna make you smile with confidence when against all ods the sun is rising again. 
Enjoyment(10): I guess there's no need to add any comment here. If you can deal with the fillers, you are experiencing the best out of this incredible journey. I've never enjoyed an anime or a film as much in my whole life. It has also taught me how to enjoy my own life in the real world, which is pretty similar if you're able to make an analogy. I can proudly affirm this creation has saved my life.
Thank you for reading my review!",10
"
                Ok First off I've been watching the Naruto series since {May 2016} at first i was not going to write a review, After reading some reviews i felt obligated to put my 2 cents.. This review will be very biased in, my opinion but i dont care.
Story 7 ~  We have two main protagonist  (Naruto & Sauske)  That are seen through the entire series and we also can also add in saukura as well as the rest of the  supporting characters that get little to no screen time. If you watch the anime fully and completely then you can follow suit
                  with the story/ plot there are  misinterpretations in the story plot altogether. It infuriates me and ill tell you why most of this anime is made up of fillers, not that i find fillers important but its more so a drag you have people that were dead showing up in flashbacks, the fillers are ok i can at least say that honestly they do develop and cover more so of the time when all the shonobi were young and other crucial points in the plot... I just hate when good parts for example naruto v. pain there was like a ton of fillers i was at the edge of my seat only to be disappointed.
Art 5 ~ What happened!!!! the art is terrible why did they get lazy tho???... the art is very flat you have stiff characters i wasn't really paying attention but when i actually did they looked like sticks talking, they got the characters flying in the air???.. moving forward i can say that i do like some of the sunsets that were really pretty and seemed some what realistic and some fights that really looked good and was vibrant overall they could have did better they got lazy and thats just that.
Sound 8 ~ Personally i love the sound some of the soundtracks like ""closer, diver, and yellow moon that i was able to find on itunes and now i listen to them daily... some of the music is ok but i still listen thoroughly (so i can grab food so i can watch the next episode) lol
Character 6 ~ Ok in naruto shippuden theirs really nothing fun and giddy about it i must admit when i watched naruto i found it very annoying and extremely whinny but i continued  watching it and it was very rewarding as i continued  to go along with the story, naruto is not his same self there is really no humor in the series everyone is serious only sai giving us a laugh with his straight forward responses but there is little to know character development i just seen neji after 8-9 episodes like where are the characters that we all love and adore overall everyone grew up the same only thing i would say thats different is there attire. I wouldnt be surprised if urochimaru can back to life... moving on.
Enjoyment 7.5 ~ 8 : ok i wouldnt say that naruto shippuden is trash i did enjoy the breath taking fight scense that had me rewinding every 5 seconds even the waste land of of  fillers that seemed annyoing or even the determination that naruto has to save his friend.. they could have just took more time to strategically contrast the art the characters being stiff and character have slits as a mouth... 
( naruto passing out after sauske attacked the sumit had me in tears)
overall 8 ~ overall this is a good anime but  i wouldn't recommend it if your constantly busy with work or school or etc.  its very time consuming and if you dont have that much free time then this is not a good anime for you to try and be watching, you can watch a few episodes but the story plot takes so long to build everything started popping off at the chuin exams but dont expect for this show to have fight scenes every episodes overall if you have enough time to sit and  watch this anime go for it.",8
"
                I am a manga reader and pierrot studio really did massive destruction to my favorite character. Now many people hated sakura because of what studio pierrot did to her. Not all anime watchers read manga like me. Stop damaging other characters for your own goal. I now have a great trust issue in every anime adaptation they release. I had to read the manga before watching it due to what they did to this series. I hate their production. The manga is so good to read and is so satisfying however the anime production is a huge disappointment for me.

The greatest strength of Naruto is its characters's stories. As a series with such a long runtime, Naruto has the chance to introduce and flesh out numerous characters, and because it is so long, I ended being quite attached to them. One of the strengths of this author is creating strong emotional backstories for his characters, and this was by far the best aspect of Shippuuden for me. The never-give-up attitude of Naruto is a staple of the shonen protagonist, but I feel Naruto owns and embodies this quality so well in a world filled with people who have given up in one way or
                  another that it becomes his own. 
The infamous talk-no jutsu, the tendency of fights in Naruto to include an actual argument between Naruto and his opponent, is in my eyes one of the strengths of the series, because it made all those conflicts more than power struggles; they were also ideological conflicts. I am not claiming that the ideological struggles in question were deep necessarily but it does give them more meaning. 
One thing that impressed me with Naruto in general and is reflected in Shippuuden is that even though the story went on for so long and in some ways it's clear more than one retcon happened over its run, the world it constructed was remarkably well-rounded and all the dots were connected. For me this was never more clear than during the double episode revealing the circumstances of Naruto's birth, which managed to explain everything we knew from the first series and link to everything we learned afterwards, even though I'm willing to bet it wasn't how Kishimoto had imagined it would have gone when he began this story.
There are some big weaknesses to Shipuuden. 
The most obvious one is the incredible amount of filler. While some arcs could be worth watching, overall they should be skipped. Some of them are so nonsensical that they can be fun to watch as basically a self-made parody of the show.
A sore spot that stands out for me is its female characters. I wouldn't say Sakura is as useless as the meme says, but it highlights how overall, the author has a really hard time giving them a story where they have agency, even if said female character is part of the main cast. There are still a few gems, mostly Tsunade.
Also the third arc is the weakest of them, despite having many epic moments and great characters, the way they are all bundled is pretty weak story-wise (notably a certain problem about masterminds in the shadows on repeat).
Nonetheless, when all is taken into account, this series is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorites. Its worldbuilding, fights and characters are just so memorable. It's not the best anime by any measure, superior entries exist in almost all regards. But Naruto has a way to make you care about its characters and get invested in their story that excuses all the filler in the world.",10
"
                Despite the never-ending fillers and flashbacks, Naruto Shippuden has a very decent storyline... Perhaps the story gets well when told in many episodes... Honestly, I love watching the fillers too except the mechanaruto episodes... Well I don't like mecha thingy... 
About Naruto, I love him since the Naruto series... but in Shippuden, I didn't like him when he couldn't control his anger which consequently releases the nine-tailed fox power and unintentionally hurts his friends... 
My favourite part of the anime is the war... Everyone is united to fight the same enemy... but more importantly, there are so many surprises... Also, there are portrayals of qualities
                  such as high fighting spirit and strong comraderie... I really love them...
If I want to compare Naruto Shippuden and the Naruto series, Naruto Shippuden has more serious plot... Mostly because of the Akatsuki... Naruto Shippuden has more tragic scenes too... and of course the fighting scenes are all the higher level ones since all of the characters had developed their attitude, skills and power... Also, Naruto Shippuden is full of emotions... I cried so many times watching this series...
The OP and ED mostly are good... the background songs are very very good... they match the scenes... In fact, whenever I listen to certain songs, I would remember certain scenes...and I usually end up watching again...
For me, Naruto Shippuden is truly a masterpiece... Well, about the fillers, I do not mind at all since they somehow make me feel attached to the characters and to the canon... In fact, some fillers add more understanding of the canon... 
To those who want to try watching Naruto Shippuden, you must first watch the Naruto series... at least until Sasuke leave Konoha so that you could understand the bond between Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi... 😊",10

                Before I begin, I notice this anime is one of those ""love or hate"" animes.  There's some people who say it's the shettiest anime ever, and some who say that it's the best anime ever.  The people who claim it's the best anime ever should watch some more anime and THEN re-rate, and the people who claim it's the shettiest anime ever... are just following the crowd because people like to bash on the popular anime.  This anime is seriously NOT OVER-rated given how many people hate this anime, and it's also not UNDER-rated given how many people love this anime.

Story - 7/10  It goes by arcs and the story isn't confusing (if you watched from the beginning) and several arcs are really sad and the plot was interesting to watch.  However, I feel like it's dragging on and on, and the comedy scenes aren't as funny as the first Naruto.  Another thing is the ""I will bring back Sasuke!  Believe it!"" and ""He's a precious friend!""  is overused too much.  Is Sasuke the only thing Naruto thinks about?  (Then comes the SasuNaru fans, myself included)  I don't get how a traitor who betrayed his friends and village due to jealousy and vengeance is still a friend, but if Naruto thinks that, then it's fine I guess.
Art - 9/10  Clean and easy on the eye, nothing too special, but the art is pretty nice.
Sound - 10/10  
Character - 7/10  The characters each have their own personalities, and I don't see much Mary/Gary stus.... except for Naruto himself.  Not only can he train faster than anyone else (like when getting the rasengan and sage mode), he can also persuade a godly powerful dude (Pein).  Naruto, in the beginning was a knucklehead ninja that everyone hates, but toward the end, he became less of a knucklehead and people began to acknowledge him, which was good character developement.  Something about the characters annoy me, and that is how SO MANY characters have a emo sob story behind them.
Enjoyment - 9/10  I enjoyed it.
Overall - 7/10
The ""motto"" is like ""If you work your butt off and have the will to do something, you will succeed"" which is obviously not true.  I also dislike the fact how Naruto often touches his tummy and go like 'Oh the nine tailed fox is inside me""  It just looks wrong... and sounds wrong...  I can imagine Naruto giving birth to the Nine tailed fox lol....  Another thing I'd like to say has nothing to do with the review, but if the whole village treated me like shot shet and a jealous friend betrayed me, I wouldn't just put up with it... I'd probably bomb dat stupid village and give the friend a serious beating...",7

                 Story: The story of Naruto Shippuden is about Naruto Uzumaki he is one of the 9 jinchuriki. Naruto came back to the Leaf Villiage and god knows where he was. And this continues with Naruto continuing going after Sasuke Uchiha, his best friend. It's a nice story to be honest.
Art: The art in Naruto Shippuden is the same as the original just a bit upgraded. It's art is very good, compared to most anime I've seen.
Sound: The sound is great it's the same as the original Naruto, so there's not that much to it.
Character: The character in Naruto is good, it's just the development,
                  it's so slow, and you hardly see any development after any battles. Only with Naruto, you hardly see any other characters develop.
Enjoyment: I've enjoyed the series a lot, Naruto is one of my first animes I've ever watched it's a good anime, and it has a great story, very good art, and great sound.
Overall: I rate Naruto Shippuden an 8/10. The sequel to this series great, the art and sound are great, same with the story. It's just the character that stops this anime from getting a 9/10. I wish we get to see other characters learn new jutsus, this series is very good overall. I recommend it to people getting into anime.",8
"
                It's a boring show and I couldn't even stand watching it anymore. I don't read the manga, so I won't be comparing it to the manga.
Up until the Pain arc ended the show was great (I would of gave a 8 overall) except for boring filler episodes, but once the Konoha past filler ended it went straight down hill. It started becoming some bad emotional drama. Every second a flashback would occur showing some scene involving Naruto and Sasuke playing the SAME song every time. I mean 2 non-filler episodes were literally 18 minutes of flashbacks showing the same flashbacks they played the last 10
                  episodes. 
I can't stand the silly plot anymore and if flashbacks are not happening it's the same thing reoccurring. All the Hokages 'WAR' let's go tell the feudal lords 'WAR' let's let all the people know 'WAR' that took 20 episodes LONG. There was no plot development what-so-ever. I plan to continue the show once the war actually begins.",6
"
                An anime I was very fond of, which I could label myself a true FAN (which is rare to me) but that I unfortunately felt forced to drop.
The reason: Way too many many many fillers, plus the way that Sasuke guys suck lemons with his attitude and how Naruto won't just give up the prick just turned an anime I really liked into something un-watchable in only 95 episodes.
Plus, the story drags itself, the plot develops soooooo slowly that it makes me think Kishimoto should have been kidding his fans, to the point I felt it to be disrespectful to make an anime so mediocre
                  like Shipuuden.",3
"
                To be honest.... this show was actually great... in essence, it could have been one of the most amazing and adventurous shows imaginable, with kick ass fighting scenes and heart felt emotions that are honestly pretty relate able. With its large and expansive world, having its own history to it, it's hard to imagine such a show being fucked up!!!.... Oh wait... -.- 
Now being serious, Naruto could have honestly been one of the greatest shows imagine able. You have this fleshed out story following this one kid who was looked down upon his entire life, and you see him rise and up and fulfill
                  his dream. What could be bad about that!? That already sounds awesome!! Then you add in some more kick ass characters like Kakashi and fighting scenes and an actual story and a goal and boom!! Sounds good right? R-right....?
Now... here's where in my personal taste, this potentially amazing story and show, goes skyrocketing the opposite direction it had the potential to go for. There is, so much, SO, MUCH, POINTLESS, TALKING...... in this show you will catch yourself watching 40% of the last season despite it being the next season and when I say this I mean the FLASHBACKS HOLY SHIT. The fillers in this show are even immense, most of the talking in this show is also very pointless.... and what's worse? The action is crap!! And no, I don't mean the action itself is crap, honestly it was pretty enjoyable, that 1 minute of fighting you saw for every 45 minutes of talking, you get why I think it's crap now? Even IN the middle of some fights when all the action is building up and the drama and intensity is rising, SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, has to SOMETHING, that involves that..... or wait, even better... a flashback.... 
This show honestly had so much potential, it has such a wide spread world that is honestly pretty unique and creative. It has a very fleshed out story, explaining things from the VERY beginning (you rarely if ever see shows doing this) and an amazing adventure following this one admirable kid grow up with great and fleshed out characters near him. The fighting itself is honestly not boring and some of the dialogue is honestly pretty interesting, and heartfelt. But what totally and completely ruins this show for me is the fillers, the constant nonsensical talking, and the CONSTANT FLASHBACKS I CANNOT STRESS THIS, We just got done watching Naruto when he was a kid (first season) and we're onto the second season and you think we need to REWATCH what we already WATCHED!? And that's not including the fillers that INVOLVE flashbacks that have NOTHING to do with the show. Literally the most pointless thing imaginable, imagine it, right now, and Naruto will make a fucking filler out of it somehow. 
Mind you most of this is the show version, I heard a lot of the fillers and pointless talking is taken out of the manga, but honestly I wish they did a better job with the anime.... the sounds in this show are honestly quite nice and do a good job of impacting the show and making the scenes they provide more vibrant.....
With Narutos interesting and unique characters and setting, along with an admirable person following an ambitious dream leading us to various interesting and adventurous tales and awesome fight scenes, this show had so much potential..... I hope in the future they will do a rework on this could be great show.",6
"
                If you haven't watched Naruto before Naruto shippuden you might still get the plot but the feeling will not be the same, so i highly recommend you to watch Naruto to get the full experience of the path to your ninja way.
Anyway, the story and most of the plot twists are extremely interesting but first you need to get through some occasional fillers that really did frustrate me though i think they were worth it as when the time came for the episode (non-filler) it gave me so much adrenaline all the way throughout the 20 minutes. I also liked that not all episodes were
                  serious and manged to give off a funny vibe to them making it quite enjoyable and making it possible for us to see a different side to the characters.
The animation was fantastic and you could see that they actually spent a lot of thought and time in making the fight scenes. I also personally very liked the character design as it wasn't too much so that all the attention is taken off the plot and just towards the character and not too little so that you can't work out who the main characters are... In addition, all the antagonists had a very decent back-story to why they became like that and this is why my favorite character is Uchiha Itachi (not going to give any spoilers on him so i'll just leave it at that)
Now the sound. The sound...what can i say... the sound and all the openings are defiantly something that i rarely skipped. But the very first opening of Naruto Shippuden is still something i sometimes listen to as i don't think i will ever binge watch this anime because it took me about two months, something i do not and never will regret.",10

                I'm sorry but i didn't like this anime i thought the art was very disappointing i also thought that tv tokyo really let me down with it there a zero for over all sorry if u hate me

"
                Regarded as one of the world’s most popular and long-standing animations, Naruto has undoubtedly crafted a shinobi universe that is intriguing for anime viewers. The styles of different clans, the movement of each jutsu, the history of each nations, all of them are well-choreographed and deserve a big applause. The foreshadowing is brilliant and what amazes me is that they always succeed in keeping the mystery going until the “real” truth is unveiled, such as the Itachi/Sasuke arc and Madara/Tobi arc. 
Why Naruto as a character Ruins it for me:
The downside is, while there is an amazing array of characters on the show (i.e. Rock
                  Lee, Gaara, Shino, Iruka), the show solely puts its spotlight on Naruto - which is a shame. The author made no effort to give other characters a chance to shine and that leaves the show rather dull and one-dimensional. Characters like Tenten, Ino and Kurenai are merely females to waste away in the background.
My least favourite part is Naruto Uzumaki, who has continued to be one of the most unconvincing and quite frankly, an annoying and obnoxious character. His positivity gradually becomes a massive turn-off in the show. When it progresses to a point where everyone just blindly praises whatever comes out of Naruto’s mouth, you just can’t help but roll your eyes. It’s so far-fetched that it’s just absolutely bonkers! There is a fine line between a motivational speaker that is full of utter gibberish and a good inspiring character that doesn’t overcompensate, and here is where Naruto fails to do for me. Everytime he speaks, I would just happily mute the thing. :)
One of the wasted potentials in the show is characters like Rock Lee, who works his way up against all odds and no ninjutsu talent. With his humble (and much more likable) attitude, I can see how this underdog could potentially turn the table at the end. Still, the show never shows mercy to any character other than Naruto. Most of the time, everyone is just there fighting until they are saved and rescued by the all-mighty Naruto and his “genuinity”. For once, I would just like to see other capable characters to shine in their own ninja way, instead of making the Naruto way the only way. 
Last but not least, the amount of filler and recap is frustrating. You spend 20 minutes watching a full episode and only ¼ of it is new. What a drag. As someone who started out as a huge fan watching, and having a completely different opinion towards the end, I am to say the least disappointed. On the other hand, I would recommend its two spin-offs, Uchiha Sasuke no Sharingan Den (manga) and Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals (anime and manga), which are very well-written and hit all the right notes if you’re down for some lovely wholesome humour.",6
"
                Let me start this review by saying I've seen every episode that has been aired for both Naruto (completed) and Naruto Shippuden (currently) and yes that also includes fillers.
*Now I understand that not everyone is going to have the same opinion as me but the entire Naruto franchise will always have a dear place in my heart and here's why:
Story: The story line for Naruto Shippuden is a lot different from Naruto, but it is equally great. Once you get past the infinite amount of filler, or decide to skip them, it is clear that although Sasuke's retrieval makes up most of the adventures, there
                  is just SO MUCH MORE to follow along with. Naruto Shippuden can have you crying, laughing, stressed and angry all in the course of one episode. 
Characters: My oh my how they have changed. All of the characters have grown so much and even Kiba is likable haha.
Here are two examples:
Naruto came back a whole new person. Literally. His outfit is upgraded, his maturity has somewhat increased, and so has his height ;)
Sakura: one of my favorite characters is clearly no longer ""useless"". I love her but I have to admit, she did not have much to contribute to Part 1 but now... If you haven't caught up to at least episode 400, your in for a treat!
Overall Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, the movies, the manga, everything is 100% enjoyable and if you decide to stick with it to the end, you'll be in for a treat",10
"
                The penultimate story of growth in a ninja. A story that took 15 years to tell on screen, 10 of which were in this series. A tale that spans exactly 500 episodes and leads to a feeling of satisfaction and completion. This is the legend of Naruto Uzumaki.
Story: 9/10
The story takes place following the events of ""Naruto: The Series"". Sasuke is gone. Naruto has gone to train with Master Jiraiya. Everyone else in Naruto's ninja class has some sort of training to do of their own. We come back from the 2 year time jump to Naruto's return to the Leaf Village. Time to start
                  the endless train of action, suspense, and detailed storytelling. Naruto must prevent the heinous Akatsuki group from stealing the power of the tailed beasts to start a massive war that spans across the world, all the while trying to find his lost friend and return him home. While some filler arcs take place here and there and some episodes are akin to Dragon Ball in that there's a whole lot of standing around and talking, the action and set-pieces are a joy to behold and you can't wait to see what happens next.
Art: 8/10
As soon as the first episodes airs, you can see a difference in quality and design in the animation department compared to the first series. Vivid colors and detailed expressions are abound in every scene. Fight sequences are expertly choreographed and have your eyes jumping around the screen. On rare instances, the animation turns to a swift, almost comedic style, especially during rapid fight sequences (Naruto vs Pain). However, these changes in quality are almost endearing and help express the action even better in my opinion.
Sound: 8/10
The music and voice acting that goes into this show are stellar. Sure, we get a lot of Naruto screaming and shouting, but the emotional and happy points in the story are all worth it in the end. Seeing character's emotions on full display through voice acting is genuinely an art on its own. The music tracks that play throughout the story help bolster scenes and the emotions that viewers should be feeling.
Character: 9/10
This is the driving force of a story. Character development and how they alter and mature through the course of a series is paramount to its enjoyment. Here, we see characters change their views on the world and its outlook just on the basis of a few words. The power of words can be very strong, especially when they're wielded by someone who never gives up. Nearly every character that we got to know in the first series has a moment to shine at some point, granted it's 500 episodes in its entirety.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Overall, I had a blast watching this series. I never read the manga, so I never knew what to expect during each episode. The occasional filler arc was a drag to have to wait through, but sometimes you get character development that you see further down the line due to what happened during filler arcs. Once the show came around the final corner and reached its end, I was both sad to see this show reach its end, but also happy with its conclusion. 
Then we got Boruto, which is a creature all on its own. You can read my review of that show to see what I mean.",9

"
                Ever since I was a kid I have followed this, and it's always been my very favorite. But I think you need to watch Naruto before you start on Shippuuden as it carries a lot of backstory over. 
Shippuuden has a lot of fillers here and there but in the long run it's worth it for me. Some fillers are okay, they actually add story to a lot of characters, others are just horrid and pointless. In a sense it adds a lot of tension and build up to the main story. 
It will not shy away from death either in the characters, which is
                  personally one of my very favorite things about this show. I can't stand it when people survive miraculously by some freak-cause. 
Overall I highly recommend this anime. Maybe skip the fillers at most.",10
"
                Best freaking show of all time hands down, no cap. This show changed my life in every way not even joking it has a perfect story full of development and amazing characters. I would highly highly highly recommend this show for many reasons. It taught me more about love, life and faith than anything else. I cannot say enough good about this show. Watch it and stick with it until the end the reward is insane even though it is long it is so worth it. Words don’t do it justice I love it so much. This show is filled with memorable moments and characters
                  that will give you chills and make you a better person at the end. The soundtrack is unbelievably good and will, stick with you forever. This show cuts deep and makes you cry laugh and everything in between. This may seem like a fluffy all good review but that’s because it is a perfect show I am not overdoing my love for this show.",10
"
                This review is spoiler free.
Well then I have been waiting to be able to write a review about an anime that has been around for almost two decades and oh boy what a anime it was. I didn't just teach us that not everything goes as planned it also teached us that everything must come to an end. And unfortunally it did. It did end, but even so this sure was a anime. Anyway let's just start!
Story 9/10: The story, the story is just your standard Underdog Action/Adventure story, but done damn right. You have probably heard of it, but we follow a boy named
                  Naruto, a boy that wants to be the hokage, but because he has a monster named the Ninetails sealed inside him everybody in the Hidden Leaf Village (The village Naruto lives in) stays away from him because they know what the Ninetails is capable of doing. But even so Naruto doesn't stop and let his rage take over no! Instead he struggles his way to everything hoping to find a ray of light at the end of the hellish road he has to walk. Overall the story was again just your standard underdog story, but because the series gone on for so long we were able to see all the events in detail and that is what I personally couldn't get enough of. Seeing all the characters grow up and new characters getting just as much growth to them.
Art/Animation 8/10: The art, the art was something I never really liked nor hated. It was well standard, just your typical anime artstyle, but the reason I gave this an 8 is because of the animation. The animation was well overall barely passable, but what made it so it got an 8 then? Well it is actually quite simple It is because of the animation in some of its fights. Yeah the reason why most of the show has ""bad"" animation is for the sole reason to make a important fight stand out animation wise. And these amazingly animated fights are the reason that I got into Naruto, there is just something so satisfying seeing a fight with incredible animated choreography and a story that they are telling during the fights. It is just perfect, even though it only lasts for a couple of minutes it still drives you to watch more of it even if it is just to see another of those great animated fights.
Sound 8/10: The music of both Naruto and Naruto Shippuden aren't anything outlandish, no the opposite. It is just your upbeat songs but this time around it has a shinobilike vibe to it. And it fits perfectly. But there is none of them that really stands out to me like You Say You Run from Boku No Hero Academia for example. So overall Naruto just has some solid osts which I can enjoy even though I will forget them after the next episode anyway.
Characters 7/10: So the characters. Honestly Naruto has just your basic kind of characters, you have the main character that doesn't know when to give up, the rival of the main character who everybody likes but is depressed as **** and then you have the main waifu who is mostly there for ""emotional"" moments even though every time she is in an opening she cries. Anyway, even though Naruto has some of the most basic character tropes they are still different and that is because the show went on for so long the characters were able to develop their their feelings. And because of that you still manage to get attached to them.
Enjoyment 10/10: I'll keep this one rather short because there is not much to say. The enjoyment of this show was perfect. The anime managed to find a balance between serious fights and comedic episodes so that it never felt out of place. And because of that I could always enjoy the serious episodes but also the episodes where there are just solid jokes after jokes.
Overall 8/10: Overall the show was really good and truly it was a once in a lifetime anime expierence. I don't know yet if I will watch boruto but what I do know is that this anime now has a special place in my heart even though it is not in my personal top 10 favorite anime. 
Well then hopefully you liked this review. This one was rather short but I am satisfied with it. Well then see ya'll!",9
"
                Overview: I like Naruto Shippuden’s special abilities, complex battle scenes, and rivalries. I think they are unique to the series and kept me invested throughout its run. However, the delivery of Naruto is the key to understanding why the show is so good. The unique philosophy each character abides by, the lack of a villain who is evil “just cause”, and the ongoing themes embedded throughout the series are what truly makes the show great. I’m writing this review because I enjoyed watching Naruto immensely, but also because I felt the show constantly shifted my outlooks on power, dignity, friendship, and isolation. To me, a
                  show that is both fun to watch and makes you think deeply about how your perspective compares to that of the show’s characters is the ultimate form of entertainment.
Story: 10
Naruto Shippuden has one of the most, if not the most, enticing story for a long-running anime. Yes (semi-spoiler), there were perhaps too many “he/she was just a puppet for a greater being” toward the end of the 4th Great Ninja War, but other than that, everything else flows smoothly. The transition from villain to villain and plot to plot is relatively clean, and I never felt any milestone or major feat within the series came either too soon or too late. The way in which Naruto Shippuden tells its story is unique in that we are always able to see both sides of the fight, instead of only that of our protagonist. I know that is more of a character analysis, but I felt it really helps the viewer understand the weight of each conflict. And don’t even get me started on the fights. From the brief, speechless fights where the tension is so thick you could cut it with a knife, to the drawn out, intelligent fights where characters use both their abilities and their wits to fight it out for hours, Naruto Shippuden’s fights rarely cease to amaze me.
Art: 8
The art in the fights is fluid and each frame could be considered a masterpiece given its context. However, not all of Naruto is fighting. In fact, as crazy as it may be, a majority of the time is not spent fighting. The characters talk, walk, and eat too. It’s crazy. For these sections, the art can lack compared to the fights. It never seems to be bad or even average animation, but Naruto definitely has some stronger attributes than its animation.
Sound: 10
Giving any show a 10 in sound is hard, probably because of shows like Naruto. The theme songs change every arc or so, yet I would say almost all the theme songs do a good job of expressing the emotion embedded within the arc. Some theme songs are also just straight up amazing hype songs, and to watch any theme song that gets you pumped up for the next 20 minutes worth of episode is always a delight. The most well known Naruto song, Sorrow and Sadness, perhaps epitomizes the greatness of Naruto’s sound. The original, upbeat Naruto theme song which played whenever a young Naruto triumphed over evil evolved into an emotion filled, moving classical symphony that reflects both the changes of Naruto and the show as a whole. No other show I’ve seen has done such unique, incredible music, and I think it’ll be like that for a very long time.
Character: 9
This is the hardest part of my rating. Personally, I love Deidara. He is a stagnant, narcissistic asshole who values his ideals above all else. Usually, this type of character would piss me off because of my ability to relate him solely depends on whether or not I agree with his ideals. He has little background, and never grows. This is the brilliance of such a character, however. By staying true to his ideals throughout the show, all of Deidara’s decisions can be tied back to the idea he represents. Because we cannot relate to Deidara, we view him not as a person but as a representative for his motives. He lives to create art, and he believes his form of art is superior to all. By constantly risking his life to prove this sole belief, we come to accept Deidara values this ideal above his own life. So when characters who do have backgrounds, who do develop, and who seem more human than Deidara arrive, their methods of interaction with him emphasize the charcter’s feeling toward the idea Deidara represents. Naruto Shippuden does this with many characters, as each character seems to have their own personal philosophy of how the world ought to be, and their own motives for changing the world as well. Naruto himself is annoying at first, but he gets better as he matures, and the events which cause his maturity are well-paced and dignified. Sakura sucks, but not as bad as everyone says she does. The Akatsuki are dope in general. Sasuke, well, he is two things. He is a mess of a character who’s actions can be quite baffling. While I feel I understood Sasuke personally, many of his actions don’t make sense unless you understand the mindset of a psychopath. At the same time, he is the perfect foil for Naruto in literally every way and makes the show 100x better.
Enjoyment: 10
I would recommend skipping almost all the fillers except for those toward the end, and binge watching Naruto can get hard. It’s best to usually watch one arc in a short amount of time than take a break for s few days to a week or so before picking it up again. This just prevents the show from losing its shine. Other than that, Naruto was a blast to watch and I have definitely rewatched the series a decent amount of times. It’s that good.
Overall: 10
(Spoilers) Naruto is a show that constantly asks the question “How do we make the world a better place?” Pain, Madara, Sasuke, Naruto, Kakashi, and many other charcters try to answer this question. Each character seems to have their own personal opinion on the answer to this question, and each character seems to have their own motive for trying to make their opinion a reality. The conflict of characters who all desire the same thing yet are inspired by different motives and different backgrounds creates an engaging story. Ultimately, Naruto Shippuden may not be the show for you if you purely enjoy watching a story that lacks mistakes and leaves you with a warm feeling In your stomach. But, if you like the idea of controlling powers beyond belief, villains who are real charcters and not just one dimensional antagonist, an intense story, a main character who constantly is growing, and a range of perspectives which make you question your personal beliefs, then Naruto Shippuden is the show for you.",10
"
                Even though I marked some things as outstanding... I have to say that I think the writer and anime producers of this anime need to stop focusing so much on developing Sasuke. 
I'd like to see more of what Naruto can do then see Sasuke completely be the main focus when the anime and manga is called Naruto...I dislike it when writers focus more on one character instead of focusing on the whole reason they wrote the series called NARUTO.

                It was good to start since they had some decent fillers and plus they added alot of stuff like a bigger naruto & sakura vs kakashi battle, and more scenes like who the 6 paths of nagato's team was at first but it went down hill when naruto went to the 6th tail form when fighting pain. The animation went down big time. Plus crappy fillers appear like shino crying cause his bugs died and the bird filler arc. It's a shame cause there is no reason to do these stupid fillers. why not do a filler about declining about joining the Akatsuki and then
                  tobi threatens his villiage or something if he doesn't attack the villiage while they are preparing for war or what about instead of that dumb sea arc they have naruto trying to learn how to master the nine tails on his own and then fails then he figures out killer bee is the 8 tails so he can learn how to control his tailed beast at the island. I just don't like the anime really anymore because it doesn't seem as epic as the manga.",5

                Everybody know Naruto a huge sequel that made a big success and one of the big three : DBZ-One piece-Naruto the manga is amazing with both halves produce an amazing and developed plot.
The story is about an idiot and hasty shinobi called Naruto uzumaki who dreams to be the highest rank in his village as the Hokage while his life was condemned because he's the host of one of the Tailed beast (nine-tails)  a huge creators with monstrous power, the reason that made him determined to attract the people s'attention by becoming Hokage despite this reason is vanishing throw the development of the series,
                  Naruto the hasty boy is assembled with two team-mates , one of the uchiha clan one of the dominating clan in konoha though it completely perished by sasuke s'brother for a reason , and Sakura Haruno a jackass useless girl that has crush not just a crush on sasuke with their leader the captain Kakashi Hatake and now the team 7 goes on an adventure full of action-epic moment-comedy assembly.
Arts:art are okay sometimes amazing sometimes medium sometimes crap definition.
plot : as manga amazing, as anime -_________________- always you got hipped but after that those filler episodes take place to ruin your enjoyment
that's why this anime won't make it over 8 .
there are some holes in the plot like losing the ninja aspect in the second half and take the seriousness path in many arcs with less comedy , but overall it's entertaining.",8
"
                THIS IS JUST THE BEST ANIME FOR ME
I have never ever cried so much on any other anime. Even the most unnesscary(sorry for the spell) flashbacks can make you cry from villain to villain no matter how much irritating they. They are unique in their own way
My favourite is obviously Kakashi Itachi and Gaara!!
Not also that naruto teaches us a lot of important things, like never ever give up on your dreams, do not leave your friends and who are dear to you alone. There are lots more 
Also the greatest 4th ninja war is awesome. If you havent watched this you should. You will
                  regret later if you dont watch this
Anyways a very great anime!!!!",10
"
                I am completely overwhelmed with the slow pace of this show. This show is not what it used to be back then. The story is definitely good, the art is decent, sound...sure it's good, characters are definitely interesting, but I just cannot enjoy it because it is so slow. The fights are too long. At first it was fine, but it kept on nagging me. I'm just going to drop it. It was fun watching this anime series, but it just is not developing quickly enough. 
              ",6
"
                Naruto Shippuden is 60% filler episodes and 40% story
Story: 
This is your basic gotta get to the next power level to beat Cell kind of story. they do try to throw in some emotional stuff but it falls very flat and the ending ends just how you expect it. The story is so attached to the main group of side characters the only 3 out of over 20+ actually die.
Art:
Even though the anime ran from 07' to 17' the art style more or less stayed in the 07' era thus the later animation is average quality
Sound: 
Many Many theme songs for some one or two
                  might be decent enough. However the Main characters voice is like nails on a chalkboard. The same song is used repeatedly(for dramatic effect) in many of the episodes thus nullifying any impact it once had.
Characters:
The One place where this anime shines and the reason this anime has the most fanfics of any anime. Let me be clear, Naruto the main character has a terrible voice, is pretty annoying and has a extremely ridiculous obsession with Sasuke. I hate Naruto, but There are so many other decently fleshed out characters you will find a few that you may like and most of these character get an episode or two where they are the main focus.
Enjoyment: 
The fact that every episode has a flashback of a previous episode or flash back of a flashback that we have already seen (which sometime take up more then half the episodes runtime) makes this anime extremely annoying to watch and has gained the nickname FlashBack Simulator. Then smack dab in the middle of a main story arc they put in filler arcs just to extend the series length and making so you have to burn through an arc that has nothing to do with the main story to get back to the main story. Even then some episode are nothing but slow talking with long pauses and by the time the episode ends not a lot has actually happened. Some fights are really really good while others they just stand there and talk a lot.
Overall:
 If You have LOTS of spare time and liked the original series you may like this or you could skip to the last 10 or so episodes and be like ok this is them 2-6 years later the end.",5
"
                Story - If you managed to get through the first arc of this action anime Naruto, being 220 episodes whether you skipped the massive amounts of filler or not there is no reason to not watch this arc then since it is better in every way from before. Everything is more intense this time around and with less filler!...still some filler but in comparison to before it's less and more of the filler is actually interesting and enjoyable. Best overall story I have seen in any anime to date, so many twists and turns and surprises that I was always left wanting to watch more.
                  It only gets more intense the deeper you go so always more to look forward too till the very end.   
Characters - Since this arc takes place a few years after the previous all the characters have noticeable growth which is interesting to take notice too and in what areas. Just like the previous arc there are a great many characters to be interested in for different reasons with their own uniqueness that you can enjoy learning about many of their backstories and seeing how they are involved with the overall plot. This anime tries more this time around to write in romance as an aspect which is done better this time around...still dull and mostly annoying but it's mildly there and better at least. With hat said though the female characters do get an upgrade for sure and seem to become a much greater threat and aspect to the story this time around.
Quality - The action scenes are very fluid and amazing to watch with even more variety in the amount of abilities shown. With great visuals followed along with a great soundtrack and complex animation scenes it definitely makes for a great experience.
Overall - If you watched the previous arc of Naruto then there is absolutely no reason to not watch this arc because it is better in every way so if you enjoyed Naruto you will be amazed with this one. Naruto was my favorite anime but with this addition it solidified it to remain in that position. To much unique aspects to this anime in terms of action and story to not appreciate it fully for what it is...amazing!",10
"
                Overall, the series had a good plot with twist and turns, though a bit cliché. The main thing that would turn people away is the length of the anime, the amount of filler, the amount of episodes dedicated to flashbacks that have already been shown.
The art style was pretty good for an anime so long, being simple but enough for viewers to be able to clearly differentiate characters. There are some things in the art style that did tick me off though, like the different types of eyes - they weren't very consistent in design (some had pupils, others didn't). Also, there was the questionable
                  hair colours.
The soundtrack was the best part of Naruto Shippuden or Naruto in general. The music was really good - opening songs and ending songs were upbeat and lively (most) and the music was really good at setting the mood for the scene. One thing I did not like was the fact some characters got more than one theme song while other 'still important' characters didn't get one.
Character development continued throughout the course of the plot unless they died or went away. Character development was mostly shown through flashbacks (one of the anime's favourite things to do) and interactions. Some characters even had a season dedicated to their life story. There was something I was sad about however - it was the fact a particular character was given a substantial amount of character development, and everyone had high hopes for them when suddenly, the creator kills them off for the sake of the next series ""Boruto"". Like 'bam' they died and an OTP was gone, all the character development was gone.
I did enjoy the series though with it's funny parts and serious parts, though during the series I felt like screaming because of the characters actions/stupidity/naivety.",9
"
                In spite of its flaws I think Naruto is a masterpiece. 
I just want to preface this by saying Naruto is what got me into anime. And because of that I have strong emotions attached to the series. But even as I have watched many more anime, some of which I think are far better than Naruto, this series has always been something special to me. And that is not because of my emotional attachment, but the incredible writing which Kishimoto consistently displays.
………………..
Naruto Shippuden gets a lot of hate these days and it's somewhat understandable why. A poor final villain and a final arc which
                  dragged on, combined with a underwhelming sequel left a lot to be desired. But much of that hate comes from fundamental confusion about this complex series' themes, characters, and philosophies. Naruto Shippuden remains a great, often underrated, shounen, and a generally amazing anime overall, given you skip the filler. 
Story: The story starts off strong from the timeskip. The introduction of the akatsuki serves as a menacing and badass villain introduction. The first arc starts strong, building up tension to a climax, although it does struggle with it's pacing. The second arc is a satisfying and awesome way to reintroduce Sasuke as a character, and display his growth. Shippuden peaks in its writing from the Hidan and Kakuzu arc through the Five Kage Summit. Emotional character deaths, one of anime's best villains in Pain, and exceptional character development for the many characters serve as one of the most entertaining stretches in anime I have watched. Despite the initial quality, the 4th Great Shinobi War dips significantly in quality. The writing feels repetitive, and slow. I lost interest at some points and couldn't tell what was filler and not. Kaguya was one of the worst twists in any anime I have watched, but between that mess, there were still entertaining fights and moments. It did not ruin the series and is still solid overall.
Animation: The animation normally ranges from mediocre to ok, but during important fight scenes (Kakashi vs Kakuzu, Sakura vs Sasori, Naruto vs Pain, Kakashi Vs Obito, Madara vs Shinobi Alliance) it delivers some of the most memorable hand to  hand combat I have seen in anime. The animation alone often makes decent fights from the manga top tier. 
Sound: The music is one of my favorite soundtracks in any anime period. The sound effects also work well. Incredibly memorable, emotional, exciting, and intense.
Characters: Characters are perhaps Shippuden's strongest point. Kakashi, Gaara, Pain, and Itachi are characters people normally point to as their favorites. Even the often misunderstood female characters are well-written, especially Hinata, whose struggles with self-confidence I personally identify with.
 I’m going to focus on just one character as an example of how incredible the series is:
Sasuke Uchiha . People criticize him for flip-flopping on his goals. But Sasuke always has realistic, thematically relevant reasons to do so. He is a dynamic character, who falls into hatred and revenge only to discover his purpose and attempt to lead the world in his own direction. He is exploited and tormented by adults like Itachi and Obito, and struggles to find his purpose. He hates the world and its corruption, and contemplates destroying the very village he grew up in. He hates himself and his weakness, and experiences depression, ptsd, and survivors guilt. But upon reanimating the Hokage and realizing what a true shinobi is, he prepares to make the ultimate sacrifice, in a Lelouch V Brittania like fashion, and take the world's hatred onto himself. In the end, he realizes he only wanted people to understand him, and that he could never find peace through loneliness. And after going on a journey for redemption, he resolves to protect the very village he wanted to destroy with his life.
Here's why I personally find Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry/relationship so compelling: 
Even if you don't consider them rivals Naruto and Sasuke's relationship does a good job representing opposing real world philosophies, Sasuke's views could be compared to philosophers like Thomas Hobbes who believe that dictators are necessary to control humanity's evil nature, while Naruto represents a more optimistic outlook which argues for people's inherent goodness. It's a competition of ideals rather than just people
Regardless, it's more complex than who is stronger. Perhaps you could even argue their rivalry is w/ fate itself, with both of them needing to overcome the destiny that they would fight and die in order to shape their ideal of a future. They continually fought agains the destiny which wanted to drive them apart and cause conflict yet they ended up becoming bros. I do think their rivalry is flawed however, and I wish it concluded with both making concessions to each other's arguments
Enjoyment: 10. 
I waited until my birthday, October tenth, to watch the final fight which is also on that day, 10/10, which is Naruto’s birthday. 
This series’s strengths so overwhelmingly outweigh its flaws that just like Naruto and my birthdays it is a 10/10.",10
"
                (This review may contain SPOILERS) Fillers... Fillers Everywhere...
Story 7
Leaving the fillers aside (because it would 1/10) Naruto Shippuuden has a giant world with fun and interesting ninja system, even making an interesting world the author left several plot holes and some very convenient things, like a mask that liberated the spirits Sealed of past Hokages by Shinigami Shiki Fujin, and a character who had a jutsu of resuscitation who were never cited before, why didn 't Danzo make his move after the third Hokage died? Villains with very weak motivations...
Art 7
Two Words = Studio Pierrot, As Naruto one of the bestsellers should have received special
                  care, several fights mainly Naruto x Pain had a low-level animation, which worsened even more in the Great Ninja War
Sound 8
Like Classic Naruto, We have several strong music, continuing with the typical Japanese instruments and sometimes a good guitar solo.
Characters 6
Naruto continues the same noisy Brat always trying to convince the opponent that he is wrong with a sermon, Sakura really grew but continues with that same stereotype annoying tsundere, Sai and Yamato made an 
interesting adhesion, were characters who knew we could Expect something,. Shikamaru, Guy and Kakashi still funny, Kiba, Rock Lee, Hinata (Naruto-kun, Naruto-kun, Kurosaki-kun,) And all other ninjas have had the potential wasted. Now the villains, isn't there some kind of Psichologist Ninja in this world? Most villains seem to do bad things because they are misunderstood or suffered trauma from the past ""The girl i have a Crush who never gave me attention died what I do now? I know, I'm going to extinguish the human race."" Really ????
Enjoyment 7
You can get bored with Naruto's obsession with Sasuke, or Naruto solving the problems with a conversation that his path is right and the opponent is wrong, he does it three or four times, the plot holes, but it is undeniably a great Shounen Show by the fights and interactions between some characters.",7
"
                Disclaimer: I have read the manga and have spoilers are hard to avoid ""ex. Boruto"" so this review will include an ""ending"" review. 
Naruto Shippuden. I feel conflicted, I want to love Naruto but the amount of trash that I have to endure.. Is it worth it? I haven't really been to active in the anime community. Probably cause I don't enjoy that much anime anymore. I pick apart anime too much. I should just watch it for fun and not look deep into its construction... WRONG! 
Story: 5
Generic shounen. I mean this started as ninja and ended with omnipotent super powers. I remember someone
                  talking about how it used to be kunai's and shurikens being thrown but now its nuclear explosion level blasts everywhere. I remember when ""ninja"" was a term but this is not ninjas anymore this is some DBZ stuff. Another problem is the ending so ""SPOLIERS"" I guess...... Lets think about children how are they all the same age? Why are the combinations so random? I know Japan has some freaky sexual rituals but I mean how do explain this stuff ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
FILLERS OMG. I was able to endure the 5 episodes but those 5 episodes turned into 30. I dropped the anime at episode 375. Glad I did cause I hear they added a new filler arc right before the final battle lul.  
Art: 9
It one of the biggest anime all around the world. It would be too much if it didn't have good visuals. Didn't give it a 10/10 cause that Pain vs. Naruto fight was a pain to see ha ha ha.....
Sound: 8
Naruto's voice kind of annoys me both in the dub and sub raspy voice. Sakura just annoys me but I attribute that more me no liking her in general.  
Character: 2
Ok. So Naruto I boy who has attention problems. Yea Yea he lost his parents but he didn't really start caring until he actually ""sees"" them. Frankly, he put all that attention into ramen jokes. 
Sasuke the emo crybaby. Let me make up an excuse to hate everything and then contradict myself and make myself look even more stupid. 
Sakura oh boy. ""I love the way you lie"" - eminem and rihanna. Sums up Sakura's thoughts I think we all know how that music video ended with (The fire burned everything and everyone). So Sasuke ended up having a child with her after he tried killing her, leaving for 2 years, planning to kill and destroy everything and everyone she loved. Yea oh and after that he then leaves her to be a single mother. Good job kiddo. Oh did I mention she is also useless.
Overall: 6
While my review is only pointing out the flaws of this series I have to say I enjoyed my time with the Naruto series in general. Most of it is nostalgia cause Naruto was my gateway into more anime. Naruto is not a perfect anime. You can't give something a 10/10 if it has a flaw.  Naruto has many flaws but it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. We have to remember to actually set aside the nostalgia. Look at Boruto.. doesn't feel just like a quick cash. In conclusion I liked Naruto but as time went on it didn't hold up. 
Thanks for reading my review and have a Merry Christmas

"
                God I hated this whole series....
*spoilers ahead*
1.Bad Character development of girls especially.
2. No reason to hate Naruto bcoz he is a jinchuriki. Yes, he being hated for being mischievous is fine. But throwing stones at him and all was just too much. I would question the mindset of Leaf village of the people once lead by Hashirama.
3. No concrete reasons for Madara for doing what he does. Why does he want to make world better by putting everyone in The Matrix? (except Pain and Orochimaru their reasons were best).4. Plot holes and unexplained power ups at the end.
5. Fillers....sooo many horrible filers
And here my major reasons-
When you have created such a huge world it is important to explore that (especially 5 great nations). There was no proper exploring of the entire shinobi world, the various customs, history, etc.
Most important- why create the whole concept of Jinchuriki and Tailed beasts and show only two of them properly (Bee and Naruto, I am not even counting Gara). I wanted to know all Jinchuriki names, powers and back stories and most importantly see their all out fights with akatsuki and others. Also don’t each of the tailed beats have some special power that even their jinchuriki can use? (other thab TB bombs and chakra cloak).
Most important#2 Do all cool and badass clans live in Konoha? I wished to see other village clans and their keke genkais. But as i said there was no exploring. Deidara and kisame were only good other village ninjas for me.
Why make the 7 swordsmen of mist if not going to show each properly. Only Zabuza and Kisame are shown all cool. All of them should've been cool and shown in all out fight against protagonists and other characters and be in the story. 
Also, other than Kisame’s and Zabuza’s swords others were not that cool. Samehada was way too cool. All 7 should be equal badass swords.
Other villages top fighting forces should’ve been shown. Just like 7 Shinobi swordsmen.
Rock Lee was done bad, he had potential to be awesome! Might Guy should’ve died. His death would’ve been very impactful. Seems his life is just a pitiful drag on now on a wheel chair.
Orochimaru should’ve remained evil. Who doesn’t want an ultimate evil genius? He should’ve been one of the ultimate villains. And also if possible he should have been a major threat in Boruto too.
Uchiha clan became too Strong due to Sussano power. I wish it was a Rinnegan specific power.
Reanimation in the end was not following rules. Madara could do just whatever he wants. It seemed a bit like plot device.
The Otsutsuki clan should’ve been hyped from the start (of Naruto series) and a proper back story for origins of chakra and Ninjutsu should’ve been given- step by step. So when Kaguya finally makes her appearance it would look cool.
In all Naruto had all the potential to be the best anime ever. Awesome fight scenes and great animation but if you had the huge budget you should of hired better writers",5
"
                watched naruto kai a direct to manga fan edit of the series so without any filler, padding and a lot of redundant flashbacks (even though there was still quite a few) and it was still a mid-affair, truly an unworthy successor to a truly great anime that was the original. While it does have it's moments, they are so brief and minute compared to the vastness of its glaring flaws. credit where credit is due hidan/jiraiya/pain arc were good and some sequences in the show are kinda goated due to it's distinct expressive artistic style which involves some fluid combat between characters which i liked.
              ",4
"
                Oh, indeed it's the ever so popular Naruto Shippuden. Ready to waste mindless hours watching yet another dragged on Shounen Anime? I sure am!
Story: It's Naruto! Of course the story is going to be pretty sappy looking. Ya'know with the Sasuke and bonds stuff. But the thing is it is executed well. So the anime in the nutshell is. Naruto has left Konoha for a period of 3 years with The Legendary Sennin Jiraiya. Within these 3 years he has been training for future endeavors. Aswell within these 3 years everyone seems to hit puberty and have a major growth spurt. The former chunnin ninja
                  have become adept, some of which have become jounin. After Naruto's fated return. His team is reunited with the classic bell retrieval test. Sakura and Naruto work together to steal the bells. They both demonstrate magnificent skill. Resulting in the reconsaince of Team Kakashi. However Kakashi is always missing or injured so Team Kakashi is lacking as a team. A mysterious new ninja and a Anbu member join the team. This is when the ultimate goal of Team Kakashi uncovers. To retrieve Sasuke and destroy Akatsuki. Seems Legit 8/10.
Art: The art has improved over the original resulting a much more enjoyable experience. However overuse of certain animations is a huge turn off. Seeing the same traveling animation is quite irritating. Character Models however are very well thought out and designed. 6/10
Sound: I'm a sucker for good OPs, and NS has a good amount. Specifically Sha La La. Aswell the voice actors did a magnificent job. They aged everyones voice quite well. This would be a perfect 10 if it did not lack in actual Sound Effects which would be reused to death. 8/10.
Characters: 8/10. They were good. Not quite sure how to say how without spoilers but whatever.
Enjoyment: It is so far a very exciting watch. A very good replacement for Bleach. 9/10",8
"
                Naruto and consequently Naruto Shippuuden were the first set of anime I ever watched, and overall I am thankful for that. It helped give me a strong baseline for comparing other anime to.
Naruto Shippuuden is a continuation of the story of Naruto, a boy ninja in a world called Earth, split into 5 countries, each representing a different element, fire, water, etc. He has grown up a bit from the first Naruto series, after training with a legendary ninja of his Fire country in the interim, and is still interested in furthering his relationship with his brother-in-arms, Sasuke.
The story-line, outside of the fillers, is interesting
                  if not a bit predictable, the characters are varied and likable, the music is pretty good, and the creativity behind the various ninja skills is awesome. 
The problem with Naruto Shippuuden, as was the case with the first Naruto series, is that it is riddled with too many filler episodes, regaling exploits and side-stories of forgettable characters and events. Very few filler episodes are worth watching in my opinion.
Overall I'd say Shippudden is worth watching, but only if you have a filler list so that you may skip them.",7
"
                As I just completed the 338 episode I just took my time to examine shippuden from the start. Like most animes shippuden has its ups and downs most fillers done by the studio to drain naruto for all its worth isn't what I call  'enjoyable', but if you take your time to watch it wthout the fillers its preety good. Other than some wierd animations here and there I don't see why shippuden isn't awesome... The characters are well created the background sounds are awesome story is great...  The fillers that I would recommend is the chikara arc... I was excited with the
                  way the war arc started panning out recently. Overall I give shippuden a 8...",8
"
                Naruto, one of those legends in japanimation. No need to introduce it at this point... So for starters, I'll just say that this review will focus more on the anime aspect than on the story, which comes from the manga.
I personnally really liked the manga, at least until the Pain arc.
STORY
Long story short, it depends on the arc. This should be something obvious today : when making literally HUNDREDS of episodes, you can't hit a perfect score. There are some very good arcs and some much less interesting.
Main strong point : from all those long-shônen anime/manga, Naruto is the most consistent, telling a straight story
                  (from A to Z, without much detour).
Main weakness : the fillers. There are WAY TOO MUCH and some of them have to be watched as they contain bits of the canon story.
ART
This is what matters when making an anime adaptation of a manga. And I'll be blunt : the visuals were way too screwed up for me to enjoy Naruto.
- First, the drawings : they are way too simple. There are too few traits, and the colors are way too ""unicolor"".
- Then, the animation : this really depends on the episode. Some fights are simply amazing, but some of them are screwed up.
- Finally, there are no light effects (which is why it is all ""unicolor"").
Basically, the visuals are way too simple and irregular.
SOUND
Takanashi is a genius of music. The OST is great, although if I had to compare with Fairy Tail, I would prefer the latter because of the style. I'm not really fan of the ""ninja music style"" from Naruto...
As for the openings, there are so many...! Some of them are really good, some are not really memorable. I personnally really like the FLOW and Asian Kung-Fu Generation openings.
Overall it is really satisfying.
CHARACTER
Again, I won't really develop that point. Some of the characters are awesome, but I do feel like they could have done a better job with all those secondary characters. Naruto's friends aren't really interesting most of the time.
ENJOYMENT
Too many fillers, visuals too simple, and an overall resullt way too irregular. Because of those points, I really didn't enjoy the anime of Naruto. I do like some parts of the manga, and I was really expecting a lot from some arcs in the anime version, but wound up disappointed because the animation is sometimes awful.",5
"
                Naruto Shipuuden is a bit overrated by most, and underrated by few, then there are people like me that'll tell you the truth.  Im going to be harsh in this review... im going to keep it as real as I can. Im TELLING YOU do not believe the 10s this show is getting... you'll love it at first... then realize the show is WAAAY over-stretched and rips of plenty of other shows, and that it isnt the best anime out there... especially for shounen. So watch it! I insist! but dont get your hopes up.
Naruto Shipuuden/Naruto (lets call it naruto) is known by many,
                  loved by many, and hated by many. I watched all of naruto and im currently waiting for these damn kakashi fillers to be done. Thats what stops this anime from being complete..... fillers...  And lets not forget how much ripoff this anime does to EVERYTHING else. but enough with ranting... lets get to the rating...
Story.(6) 
The story is ok, but kind of cliche  when you think about the basics.... Super hidden powers for some unknown reason (DBZ gohan/ssj in the first place) then we have the weird love traingle that pisses me, and i bet many others off...(do I even have to mention a specific anime? its everywhere) baby trauma (DBZ goku being brought to a new planet) etc. etc. Besides that its good. you know... striving to be the best (Pokemon Ash) and finally HE DOES THE SAME ARM BEHIND THE HEAD LIKE GOKU!!! EXACTLY THE SAME!!!! he even does the -_- eyes like brock does from pokemon. 
Art(7) simple but good. not much to say here.
Sound(7) again simple but good...
Character(5) i've already pointed out all the cliche stereotypes I can... poor characters that piss you off and it seems characters just come and go whenever the story needs them... where the hell is everyone unless you need them? ""uhhh training?""
Enjoyment(6) I really cant give the show the benefit of the doubt when EVERYONE fanboys over it. I have to keep it as real as possible. Now Im not saying this isnt a good show to watch when your new to anime... but saying its your favorite, giving it a ten, etc.etc. just shows how noobie you are in the vast world of anime.
Overall(6)",6
"
                     Naruto Shippuuden is a very average anime considering it's vast popularity and will make you wonder why it is so popular. Most people who are watching this or is planning to watch this has seen the previous series. I will warn you now with the exception of Naruto chasing after Sasuke and the female characters still being completely useless please forget everything you think you know about Naruto because it is buried one way or another. 
Story 7: It manages to keep you in suspense, but sometimes becomes too dark for fans of the lighter  Naruto.
Art 6: The art
                  is still average. Nothing special.
Sound 5: Beware voice actors and tunes that don't fit with a scene.
Character 7: Some characters changed drastically, most stayed the same. Some characters are cliche.
Enjoyment 7: I'm still watching it so I like it overall.
        The series pick up from Naruto two years later and we see how much our heroes grown changing the mood to a darker more mature tone. Part of the reason people stay tuned to Naruto was because of the light and refreshing tone so for it to be almost completely gone puzzles me. It makes me miss the plot line of the old Naruto. 
          As for fillers, whether you like it or not fillers need to be use in long anime series so the mangaka can have time to write more. Still I guess the complaining of fans worked because there has been less filler use in the series. The problem is because there has been less filler use the pacing of the show has suffered. Some fights scenes are ridiculously long and constant repeat of the same flashback is the new norm.Even the camera shots are repetitive and unnecessary. For example in one episode with a reunion like air  every five seconds you see the face of a character. It gets infuriating at times.
         Naruto has always been average with their art and this time is no exception. Expect the same overall look with the occasional darker backgrounds to draw more suspense. Also the characters look mostly the same with just a change of their outfit. 
           Since this series is darker than the original Naruto so is the music. Even when it is supposed to be a funny moment sometimes the same dark melody will still play. The openings and endings are mostly mediocre, but if you want to check them out then do so! To me the dark tone of music sets the mood, but is overplayed to the point it does not stand out. Background music blends, but also makes the emotion of the scene stand out and Naruto Shippuuden falls to do that. Also it took me a while to get used to the voice actors. I know the characters have changed, but it's only been two years! Naruto's voice in the sub version sounds like a 30 year old man! When I watched Naruto I watched it in dub and I liked how their voices(even if it was annoying) matched the age of the character and was unique. Many characters in this series voice has the monotone base that never changes making the character boring.
     Now the moment most people have been waiting for in this review, the characters. ""Do Hinta and Naruto get together?"" ""Who becomes the 6th hokage?"" Well I'm sorry I won't be answering those questions, watch it for yourself. Naruto probably changed more than any other character in Naruto Shippuden. No longer is Naruto the repulsive ninja who acts before he thinks, no longer is he immature. The failure of getting Sasuke back and the training with Jiraya molded the Naruto we knew into a man. He is not even naive anymore. Sure chasing after a friend who doesn't want to be saved is naive in a way, but to me is shows his loyalty more. Sakura may have become a medical ninjia and strong like tsunade, but she is still useless like almost every girl in this series. As for Sasuke, if you still liked him after watching Naruto, well you won't now. Sasuke gets so annoying in this Naruto Shippuden it makes no sense. Sometimes you would wish anyone would kill him. Besides old time favorites you get a new set of characters plus a more detailed background of some minor ones like Kakashi. Still the characters are a little cliched.
          Overall I still enjoyed Naruto. It's funny considering at first I was totally against watching the new series, but life changes you sometimes. I would definitely recommend this to fans of the ninja genre! If this review was helpful I am glad I helped you and if it was not well I hope my next review helps you.",7
"
                Original Naruto is probably my most beloved anime of all time. I would always go back and watch any arc and still find something that makes me watch 20-30 more episodes without feeling bored. Music is fantastic, animation is very good for the time being and plot for is very complex and yet simple to understand. 
I wish i could say same thing about Shippuuden. 
First 3-4 arcs kept the same pace and value to plot as original story. As i personally find Gaara arc not as great as later one i still can see meaning to be there. It introduced whole new enemy for
                  protagonists and served as jump for series to more mature climate which i was hoping to stay until the end. Orochimaru/Sasuke and Shikamaru arcs only proved that this direction was right and gave us fantastic and memorable moments. I was invested in every single character introduced to the series up till this point in the series and waited for new episode to come out with excitement and hype. 
Until of course infamous Pain arc that started with big impact and ended with probably most awful and mediocre way that became the solution for every single problem in the anime. That is of course Naruto being the messiah that turns every enemy into his friend and make everything meaningless that happens in the past. Akatsuki mystery and threat built for almost half of the Shippuuden was just scrapped and every following arc became predictable despite having lot of turning points and amazing fights. 
The War had some great fights and showcases of characters but who cared at this point, because it was so stretched and had probably most fillers in history of anime ever. And of course we had 3 switches of main antagonist
in like 2 years without ending a single battle. It became unwatchable and even animation started to look awful somewhere on the road. 
As much as i love Naruto franchise overall, i honestly can't give Shippuuden any score higher than 5. It showed potential at the beginning but it was butchered in the end. I find that just sad and i wish that show had more great storytelling and animation.",5
"
                Who would have thought that probably the biggest anime franchise in existence would be one of the best? I came into Naruto at the recommendation (or rather pleading) of my brother. This was when I was 12 but I soon dropped it because I couldn't deal with all of the pain and heartbreak that our blond protagonist had to go through. Years passed and this show was always at the back of my mind, I knew I would have to watch it again all the way through this time. Completely by chance, I chose to start it very soon after the main story line ended,
                  i.e. the final (really final) battle between Naruto and Sasuke. As I watched the first series, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of epic battles that I had become accustomed to with shows like Bleach and Hunter x Hunter. But then came shippuden, and boy oh boy did that change. Not only did I get my wish of totally insane fights but I also got a much more emotionally mature series. To be sure, the original has a lot of pain, but they really explored it in shippuden. When all is said and all is done, Naruto really stands out as a series that gives hope for humanity and for yourself.
Note that what follows is solely based on the main story arc, I am not considering the story/art/sound/characters/enjoyment of fillers.
Story - 9: Really phenomenal. There are very few points where I feel like the story is forced, the reasons for the characters' actions are sound. Though the last bit with ""who was /really/ behind the whole thing"" seemed a little convoluted. The story is really driven by the characters, who are also phenomenal.
Art - 9: Naruto Shippuden takes a more modern approach to art than its predecessor did. This is to be expected as the whole series has been going on for about 15 years. The new art style fits the more solemn feel of the series, even though there are points of awkwardness. 
Sound - 9: The new series brings along a new and improved soundtrack. The new songs are great but aren't outstanding.
Characters - 8: They are truly amazing, though many of the women are a bit underdeveloped. It has certainly improved since the first series, but alas, you don't always get what you want. Despite this, the characters really drive the story forward with their lifelike traits.
Enjoyment - 10: It is truly an amazing show with truly amazing characters and storylines. Though there are flaws, they are overshadowed by the enormous amount of positivity this show produces. Really, this show will make you an optimist. 
Overall - 9: Naruto is really an iconic story which deserves recognition, sure, it probably reminds you of when you were a weeb. And yes there are a TON of fillers (but in this day and age, one quick google search can tell you which episodes are fillers, so just avoid them), but Naruto Shippuden (and more broadly the Naruto franchise) is among the best stories of all time.",9
"
                I feel like the ONLY reason this show received so many lower ratings was cause of it's fillers. I don't really blame that entirely on the show with all the studio management, catching up with manga etc. etc.
I'm gonna rate this show at the core of it's story. And the Core story, is pretty much second to none. If you are willing to watch all the episodes of this series, which I know is alot, then it is damn worth it. The Story is So Grand, So Emotional, attacks the viewers in a deep and moral level, and so hype/exciting that I just can't get
                  enough of this story and I'll be sad the day this show ends for sure. Aside from the filler episodes, I love everything about this anime.",10
"
                This anime is truly amazing.
first i will start off with the negatives about this anime. there are wayyyyy to many fillers and some parts you really just want to skip because it's slow. I myself stopped watching occasionally but was determined to finish. at first i wanted to watch every single episode but i couldn't do it tbh.
but overall, this anime is one of my favorites. it's such a good mixture and if you watch all of it out you will enjoy it so much. it's a literal emotional rollercoaster. you'll cry and you'll laugh and you'll be so happy and angry and sad all
                  at the same time. in my opinion, the main characters progress so much and it's really worth it to see them go through this whole process to get where they are in the anime rn.
so please watch it. you won't regret it.",9
"
                My opinion:
story 10/10 It made me cry several times,he was funny whenever he needed to,with a beautiful story
animation 8/10 It was not the best but it also had very nice battles
aesthetics-sound 9/10 constantly plays with your emotion,It has some things worth a listen and may sound a little funny but changes your view on some things in life

few words about the series (naruto,naruto shippuden)
""Naruto is a boy who, on the day he was born, coincidentally had a giant demon fox spirit attack his village. Using a special kind of energy called chakra, a powerful individual sealed this demon fox inside of Naruto to protect the village. Naruto's parents however die in this attack, and he resorts to troublemaking for attention, as well as aspires to become the Hokage, the leader of the village, for people to acknowledge him. To do so, he must become a great ninja, someone who uses their chakra to perform special techniques, such as manipulating the elements to spit fireballs, raise walls of rock, blow gusts of wind that can slice through trees, manipulate the body, or create illusions and trick the opponent. The story of Naruto is about how he grows from a 12 year old low class weak ninja with his friends/classmates and their teachers, including his training to become stronger, personal struggles as well as the ones with the other villages, and fights with strong opponents. It also has his internal conflict with the demon inside of him as well as his attempts to be acknowledged by people as he grows in strength. It constantly has you wondering how things are going to turn out as strategy in combat is critical as they often fight enemies more powerful than they are, and must come up with the strategy to get ahead. Most people find themselves rooting for Naruto as they watch him do what seems impossible as due to his life as an orphan, as well has his overall complete lack of talent in all but a few specific things, has made him vow to NEVER give up, ever, and allows him to see the truth behind his opponents. Death is there for all sides, but it is not always the only solution because of Naruto.",10
"
                I grew up with naruto, I watched him grow, get stronger and eventually achieve his goal. I learn many life lessons from naruto and it will forever a part of me and the anime/manga that had made me the way I am now somehow...so, I am really bitter about saying how shippuden change my high opinion about it. 
With it's enormous amount of fillers, the story was hard to follow at some point and I lost my interest pretty fast. The fourth ninja war was dragged for too long in my sense, with always a new final boss showing up, the dead that are brought
                  back to life, and again fillers with new characters that sometimes appeared out of nowhere and weren't even in the manga. And this is my personal opinion, the end was really lame...I mean, the fight between naruto and sasuke, how they settled thing once and for all was great but I found the fact that they both survived stupid, and that was only to reach a sequel in Boruto which is...no comment....only a way to save the franchise and make it go on. Maybe not kill off naruto and sasuke but at least one of them (sasuke) but both you'd have been better and the spirit of naruto would have stayed in people's memory. Well, that would have been so much more better. Anyway even though shippuden was overall average to me, Naruto (from the old days) will forever stay my treasure.",6
"
                The only reason i gave story 9/10 is because of the filler. Other than this though, I think Naruto Shippuuden (and Naruto) is the best anime ever. The arcs are amazing with impactful villains and great heroes. The character development (even though the filler can be a little excessive is great). It made you love all of the characters and made you feel like you lost someone close when they died. It also makes you excited when Naruto overcomes a weakness and defeats a great enemy. Some people think this is just plot armor but I personally think it makes more a great story (like
                  in dragon ball). The action is amazing and is greatly complemented by the soundtrack. It may use the same song a lot, but once you here that one song you get a great feeling and you know something great is about to happen. This anime makes you sad and happy.  I would recommend this anime to all anime watchers and i give it and the original Naruto a ten out of ten.",10
"
                Even with the filler episodes and with certain events being stretched out for what seems like forever, Naruto Shippuuden still manages to live up to it's reputation. 
This sequel manages to capture the childish tendencies of the previous installment while adding a new sense of meaningful plot and emotion. While the original series dabbled on this, Shippuuden takes it to a whole new level. This adds a whole new layer to the show, with loads of plot elements adding a new sense of maturity to the show, even if it still is very fun and childish. 
When it comes to the episodes of filler, while
                  they can be annoying to watch, I believe this doesn't take away from the show. It is very tempting on the first watch to skip the fillers and have plot development. While I completely understand this feeling, I believe that this show shouldn't be dismissed as lesser because of how many filler episodes it has. Even when the plot is not being explored in these episodes, they still manage to be enjoyable even if they serve no purpose in the overall story. But even with this opinion, I understand the want for the story to continue. So if you are the kind of person who watches a show for plot development, maybe skip the filler episodes unless you want to see more of Naruto and his friends kicking some ass. 
Naruto is one of the series which completely deserves the hype around it. It has amazing characters and an amazing story, with plenty of enjoyment to be found in watching it. I highly recommend it to anyone interested.",10
"
                First: this is a shounen anime, with a lot of fights and comedy parts, there's almost no romance. And, if you don't like fillers, read the manga and be happy.
Story (9/10): the story is as original and funny as Naruto was. The friendship, the perseverance, the fights and enemies... My favorite fight happened in this part of the serie. But, the fillers and deaths almost made me quit: there are so many fillers that I felt like it would never end, and many characters I liked died.
Art (7/10): the design of characters is very good, but the animation isn't. It pissed me off that the
                  most important fight in Naruto had so many fails in animation. Look at this: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/052/9/6/naruto_vs_pain_top_6_animation_by_paouchiuga-d3a22v5.png
Sound (10/10): I liked every opening and ending in Naruto so far. I'd say they're better than the first part's openings and endings were.
Characters (10/10): although the main characters annoy me so much, I'd say the characters are captivating and likeable. Every character has a story, an original personality and appearance. I couldn't hate even the villains!
Enjoyment (9/10): even if there's many fillers, I enjoyed the serie very much. I spent the most of part of my life watching it, and I'm still watching!
Overall (9/10): the characters, sound and story are very good points, but the art and fillers are the bad point. But I recommend you Naruto, you won't be disappointed if you watch!",9
"
                So, I loved Naruto Part 1, and then I watched Shippuden, really excited for more Naruto, especially after everyone hyped it up for me. What I got is one of the most boring, mediocre anime I've ever seen. At least in the shonen genre. Let's begin with the story.
STORY: After the amazing arcs in part 1, I was ready for some more amazing writing. Well, the first arc in Shippuden bored me out of my mind. I literally dropped the series for a few months just because I couldn't watch it. The second arc, Tenchi Bridge was a little bit more enjoyable, but we basically
                  got a Kakashi and Sasuke rip off, taking the worst elements of both of the characters and creating two horrible new useless characters! The third arc was ok, it felt kind of dragged on in the 3rd act but it was good overall. The 4th arc brought Shippuden back the the writing of part 1, and oh my god it was amazing. There was tons of emotion, rich character development, and amazing fights and moments, just like part 1. I didn't like the ending to the arc, but it was mediocre at worst. The 4th arc was amazing over all. The 5th arc kind of felt dragged out, and it had poor character writing with Sasuke, Naruto and Sakura that I'll get into soon. It was really just set up for the 6th arc. The 6th arc was a giant arc, that had some amazing moments that I still love, great fights, and a amazing villain, probably one of my favorite villains of all time, but even then felt dragged out, boring and had HORRIBLE character writing. And don't get me started to the ending of Shippuden. It made me hate the show for giving me one of the worst endings ever, after I had spent over 500 episodes watching it. And there was a hell of a lot of filler, which I got fed up with and just pulled out a filler list and skipped all of the filler. Over all, the story was bad at some parts, ok at some parts, and AMAZING at other parts. It did have a ton of potential. 7/10.
ART: The visuals sucked ass. I hated the art so much that it gave me eye cancer. Of course, when the show wanted to, it looked amazing. A few moments that I don't wanna spoil come to mind. Compared to part 1's bright visuals, its shit when they make it too bland and dark. Overall, 6/10.
SOUND: Compared to the happy and amazing music of part 1, shippudens's music(apart from the op's and ed's) was horrible. I srsly hated this music. Its just a bunch of violins just screeching. Overall: 3/10.
CHARACTER: Some characters get development, but most get pushed to the side. Shikamaru gets a ton of development. but Kiba gets none. Its just shit character writing. Sasuke has some of the worst development in anime, like this guy goes from wanting to kill his bro, to wanting to do some crazy crap that I think made no sense. Sakura had development at the start of Shippuden, but then goes back to being a Sasuke simp pretty soon. Naruto also becomes a complete Sasuke simp, always chasing after him and wanting him to come back. Sasuke literally told him a billion times to just stay away from him and stop being annoying. But Naruto just can't do that, huh? Kakashi barely gets development other than us learning his back story. And don't get me started on talk no jutsu. Remember when Naruto convinced Zabuza to be a good guy at the very end? Yeah now he does that with almost every villain in the story. It sucks. But I won't lie, some characters do get character development. So overall its a 6/10. 
ENJOYMENT: Even though there was numerous problems, I actually had a fun time watching Shippuden. I did get really bored in the first arc, and during the war. But in the other arcs had fun. It was an enjoyable ride, but I couldn't enjoy it as much as part 1 because of how shit everything else was. Overall: 7/10.
OVERALL: I thought it was decent. So a 4/10. I will still recommend it if u watched part 1 of naruto and loved it a hell of a lot. But don't except the same amazing writing, character, and all the other stuff. It doesn't help that Chakra just gets way too OP by the end of the show and it just becomes DBZ. But overall if u are gonna watch it, skip the filler, and anything u think is unecesary. See ya, and I hope this review helped.",4
"
                This review is for all of the Naruto series. 
""a 7/10 show with 12/10 moments.""
This quote, along with the addition of some 10/10 characters, sums up my experience with the Naruto series pretty well. I am in no way saying that Naruto Shippuuden along with it's prequel are flawless pieces of media, in fact far from it, but I cannot ignore the lasting impact this show managed to place on me. 
I believe it's important to take this show for what it is rather than allow ourselves to be blinded by nostalgia, so to quickly bring up some of the problems within the series I'll
                  start with the frankly terrible writing of majority of the female characters. It is no secret that the girls in this show have some downright pitiful writing compared to the male ones, and there really isn't any way to excuse that. Throughout the majority of the show the girl characters seem to be used as plot devices to help forward the development of the primarily male cast, and seeing as Naruto is a battle shounen, this unfortunately comes as little surprise to me. Aside from this obvious fault, the other main problem that I'm sure everyone has heard much about is the sheer amount of filler. It is an undeniable fact that if your show is 700+ episodes long with over 40% of those being filler, there's a problem. This being said however, I understand why this was done, and don't see a problem if you choose to skip the filler episodes as Naruto is already a long series as is. Personally however, as long as I like the characters, I can find enjoyment in some filler arcs, that is if they are not shoved in the middle of an important story arc.
There are other flaws such as the poor writing of the over 200 episode long war arc and the lack luster finale of this serious commitment of a show, but setting aside the bad lets touch on what makes this series so good. 
My love for the Naruto series stems from the pure attachment you get to it's characters, I mean how can you not after spending 720 episodes watching them grow and achieve their goals, as well as suffer from loss and hardships. It may sound cheesy, but after basically growing up with these characters for years of my childhood, they hold a special place in my heart, and therefore the impact of character death or growth hits that much harder. 
Something I really commend the Naruto series for is the writing of the ""villains."" They have you questioning what is truly good and evil, with most all the villains having a clear and sometimes rather convincing motive for why they do what they do, which is something I don't see too often in shows. Often times in media villains are just chocked up to the baseless cliche of ""taking over the world"" or just being downright comically evil, but I don't see that happening in Naruto. It is really hard to hate most of this shows antagonists, as you find yourself questioning whether these ""bad guys"" are really all that bad. In a classic battle of ideologies mixed with some beautifully choreographed fight scenes, the clash between the expansive cast of equally lovable characters is something you can't look away from.
Aside from the villains, the rivalry explored between our main characters, Naruto and Sasuke, is what I believe to be one of the most enthralling dynamics in all of shounen. Watching the unbroken dance of emotions surrounding these two as they combat each other in passionate battles of skill and wit, as well as the internal mental conflict that they each face, is one of the most emotionally investing stories that I've had the joy of experiencing. Between the constant battle of love and hatred they feel for one another and the shattered bonds they share with their own home and family, the war going on within these two boys' minds and hearts is sincerely something to behold. It truly is a wonderful journey of growth and acceptance that while full of pain and heartbreak along the way, ultimately reaches a a conclusion that is wholeheartedly worth it. I find myself going back to watch the finale of their concluding fight more than I'd like to admit, but it's just that good. This iconic duo is one that is sure to be remembered for years to come. 
TLDR; Naruto has the power to make you fall head over heels for it's characters and world, you'll find yourself laughing and crying along side them, and before you know it the once daunting series may start to not feel as long. By the end I was yearning for more, wishing to see my favorite shinobi go on more adventures together, strengthening their bonds, experiencing joys and sorrows, and most of all continuing to make the Naruto series what it is; an experience worth remembering. 
I can safely say that while Naruto has undoubtedly gone down in history as one of the most iconic anime series out there, the lessons and emotions that came along with it will be forever etched in our hearts as well.",8
"
                I Love how unlike Bleach, you can see an end to this and finally put it in your complete files. I can't stand Sasuke but more than him (and even Danzo), I. Can't. Stand. Sakura. Her motivations and emotions are so wishy-washy and unfathomable and retarded beyond possibility. What pisses me off though is that I feel Naruto and Sasuke are going to fight for the death (honestly, it's gotten too out of control for either of them to survive) and I'm okay with that (it's a reasonable ending and somewhat satisfying; Naruto and Sasuke are equals that will cancel eachother out and just the
                  memory of their greatness will be enough to inspire future generations) except that can only mean that Sakura will survive to tell their story (that's how these things usually go). And before you flag me for spoilers, just remember this pure opinion and i don't even read the manga. Other than one or two irritating characters (had to get it off my chest) The story is great; filler is somewhat annoying but the story and the characters (minus the ones mentioned above) makes up for it and the music is awesome. Great anime.",9
"
                It is one of the big 3. Everyone really enjoys it.Although it has many fillers but some fillers are worth watching like kakashi story,Indra and Ashura arc,Past arc etc.Overall it was amazing for me.I do not know why people dislike it.I know it has filler episodes but one can skip some episodes.It has a nice story. Naruto became hero from 0.And the rivalry between sasuke and naruto was the best rivalry I have ever seen.At first the pace was slow.But it becomes good after some arc probably 3.And the war was the best. So I would say It is the best anime I have ever
                  seen.It became one of my favourite anime.",10
"
                An anime that to me screams Character Development! <3
So first you watch Naruto when they were kids, Sasuke decides to leave the village forever and Naruto tries to bring him back. The two face off in a climactic showdown, but Sasuke comes out as the victor.
Now you watch Naruto Shippuden, and they aren't kids anymore, they're more grown up. You follow both Naruto and Sasuke's story as they aim to reach their own personal goals and see their fates collide once more.
Also I think in the first episode already we jump right into the action. The Akatsuki terrorist group that you may remember from the
                  first series Naruto is back and two new Akatsuki members are introduced. The Akatsuki is already a big deal and then you meet two more and you're like ""Oh my god, what will their unique jutsu be, just how strong are they"".
The moment those two Akatsuki members showed up I got hyped. I realized they aren't kids anymore, the ninja we follow. They're grown up, it's more serious now, jutsu more powerful, ...HYPE!!
The anime is pretty long which makes for a good story, many adventures, many fights, new discoveries of one's past etc.
In Naruto, you know Sasuke is after vengeance for his family, looking for his brother. It takes a good while in Naruto Shippuden when it finally happens...the confrontation...the rematch...OOOOOO!!!! (sorry) They're just so good at building up for that moment. Also when they finally showed us the birth of Naruto...the attack on the village, what happened?! MY GOD <3
Also, this anime isn't scared to let go of 'good characters', allies who we followed for some time. We saw their journey throughout the series, and when the end is knocking and they start showing those flashbacks, final revelations....the FEELS!!!! <3 I'd be a liar if I didn't shed a tear here and there.
One thing that bothers me a little though is fillers...filler episodes, they're out there, and there are quite a few. Can be interesting if you want to see 'extra story' about characters, but apart from that it's a bit annoying to me. Buuuuuut if you are planning to watch it now and haven't seen it yet ever, you can skip all those fillers and just happily continue with the story episodes :)
Anyway that'll be all....In short: Great character development, lots of cool fights, the feels! Great anime",9
"
                Naruto shippuden had great promise but was ultimately let down, let me explain.    
Lets start with what Naruto shippuden does well. 
Its characters: A diverse and interesting set of characters and while there is a lot it feels like the majority of them get enough screen time and backstory to justify them being there.  
The world: Naruto shippudens world is truly something to behold, Just the fact that its a world full of ninjas with different clans is cool enough but its a lot more than just that, As the show grows so does the world and we the viewer slowly
                  starts to grasp just how intricate and mysterious it can be.   
Fights: While there are good and bad fights in every shounen for such a long show Naruto does have a consistent amount of good ones, Like other shounens such as Bleach these fights are gripping due to the fact that each ninja and ninja clan have a diverse set of tools and jutsus (techniques/ability's) giving us something new and fresh pretty much every fight. 
Moving on to what the show does ok at best. 
Animation: Super inconsistent. One episode can look great because they wanted to put a bit more budget into it and then the episode after can look nothing like the last, This can be demoralising and disappointing for a viewer who is expecting consistent animation. The show can look great but only if they want it to which most of the time is not the case as they want to save money.  
Sound (OP's/ED's): The openings and ending at the start of the show are a wonder to listen to they really put you in the right mood to enjoy the show no complaints here except for the fact that the openings gradually get a tiny bit worse throughout but that is bound to happen. The problem lies in the sound/music that happens during the episode itself not at the end or start. The music to me is too slow and sombre for what the anime is centered around which is ninjas and keep in mind these are not the type of ninjas who meditate they are the ones who throw goddamn meteors out of the sky (get what i am saying).  I am not saying its bad its just ok, average if you will.  
Now lets get on to the bad: 
The story: The story of Naruto shippuden as a whole is fine in fact i would consider it good as it keeps the viewer watching by slowly revealing more about the world and whats really going on under the surface but its just not enough to save it from the curse that is fillers. 42% of Naruto shippuden is filler , Yes you heard me correct, No i am not memeing 42 goddamn percent , mother of god. Before you go crazy hear me out, While a large portion of Naruto shippuden is filler its not necessarily bad filler and to be honest i think some of the filler is needed as there are so many characters that get their backstory from said fillers, but even with that being said it is just way way too much and unfortunately because of this filler another problem rises from the ground like a weed. With loads of fillers comes pacing issues and these aren't some minor pacing issues because while a lot of fillers are obviously going to be slow paced the fillers actually make the pacing of the non filler episodes suffer aswell, also if you choose to skip fillers you will miss out on a lot of character development and backstory as that is the general use of them in the show, its a lose lose situation. I could rant about this for days but lets leave it there for now. 
Now that i have mentioned the good, the ok and the ugly lets move on to.
Overall thoughts:  
Naruto shippuden is your classic shounen and because of this it suffers from the classic shounen problems those being terrible pacing and horrendous amounts of filler episodes which hold back what could have been an incredible show thanks to the awesome characters and world, Leaving the show only average towards the end. 
If you don't mind slow pacing and a huge amount of filler and give the show a fair shot you may find yourself entranced by Naruto shippuden's character and world building.",7

                Naruto shippuuden is one of the best anime series ever made.
This is the first time i am reviewing an anime series ,i have watched more than 70 anime series yet but my first review had to be naruto because i grew watching this ,i have learned so much about real life from it ,my ideal my way of thinking has been influenced by naruto.I can't tell how much i have cried watching this show ,there are just so much emotions in this show ,that u can feel every character .I can't remember how much i cried watching naruto ,the music is just too good it
                  will make you crying and still now when i watch naruto (after 6 years of finishing it) it still make my eyes wet.This show gives great message which are applicable in real life.
Lets start the review by talking about the story ,Naruto shippuden has one of the best story written ever , a normal human can never think of such a great story ,the story of naruto shippuuden is its root ,the base of the show .Its a very emotional and motivating story. The story will not disappoint you .The story is so well connected with past and present the characters are so well jumbled up with the plot ,every characters have significant role .Every character is given so well background and there are so many great characters thats y people have liked so many characters other then main characters .i definitely recommend watching this show because the story is just so good with every element like emotions ,hatred ,rage , sacrifice ,love and much more that this story is just so much worth watching.This fact is to be noted that the base of the story are taken from real world legends ,like the concept of chakra ,the kaguya princess ,indra-ashura , which i think is really a great work.
The animation studio did a brilliant job in this show ,this much good that some of the current show are not able to .Let me say naruto series have one the best fight scene ever made ,and the intelligence and chorography is amazing in the fight is just too great.
Another best thing of naruto is the music ,i will not say that it has one of the best music work because it has the best music work i believe ,the music is just too awesome believe me ,the opening and ending are soo soo good that they will stay alive even after the show has ended not every op and end is great but most of them are amazing. The emotional theme ,from moment to moment really hype me up , seriously the work on music wheather it op and ed or the theme everything is just too too good ,no matter what words i pick i can never appreciate them enough.
Naruto is definitely every emotional show ,but that's not all about it there is great comedy in it which makes us laugh out loud , memorable battle scene are there ,so many great quotes of different character that we can realize in our life ,its not just a show when u watch it ,u live it ,deeper and deeper u can fell in this show ,u can feel the emotions and they are so realistic ,which makes u cry like hell ,i think when we cry watching a show then it means the author was able to convey u what he wanted .its not just a show for me ,its a feeling ,a feeling that i love very much ,i really wish that all the memories of this show gets deleted so that i can watch it again ,feel the way i used to ,cry the way i used to ,be excited about those suspense.
Lets talk about the drawback of the show ,even when it's one of the most amazing show ever made ,still it has too many drawbacks , everyone knows about it that it has too many fillers ,which is one the biggest problem also the reason of low rating ,just too many fillers. If they could remove the fillers and releasing separately then i am sure naruto could have been in top 10 list.
I can keep on writing about this anime , because it made me feel that deeply but i will end it here. 
Thank you so so much for giving us such awesome show , really appreciate the author of the show ,the whole studio ,all the music work ,all the hard work is really appreciated thank you so much for giving us naruto.",10
"
                The show gets really boring and repetitive after a while so I lost interest. The one thing that was always sort of annoying about this show is the amount of talking there is. I remember watching this and they could go on for like 5 episodes with people just talking mid fight. I love epic battles, but I wanna see battles not a 3 hour long conversation rofl.  I will give these guys credit for making some really interesting characters. It didn't seem like they had issues finding new powers to give them. My final lack of interest may also have to do with
                  the fact I watched this show when I was about 14, so, I may have just outgrown it over time. If they ever decide to make a more mature version of Naruto that didn't censor or hold back on anything I'd definitely give it another shot.",5
"
                The original shonen jump Naruto was all around a very good show. Introduces us to the characters that we would be following for the next 719 episode across Naruto and Shippuden and it has some pretty great moments like the chunin exam arc and the land of waves arc. All around I thought it to be a great experience. Then I got to Shippuden and as soon as I finished it I had felt that I changed as a person after watching it. It is an absolute masterpiece and honestly Im mad at myself that I didnt watch this earlier because I only got into
                  anime over quarantine like a lot of other people did. The story is honestly significantly more interesting than shonen jump because there was an actual story line instead of a bunch of random missions. The art at sometimes can be a little weird but that is made up for by the beautifully animated fight scenes and the animation gets significantly better towards the end. The characters for the most part are likeable but there are indeed some characters that you very much want to punt through a roof. Also, in my opinion, the biggest downside is that there are a significant number of characters that don't get developed enough and its mainly the girls which kind of leaves a bad taste. The openings and the ost are iconic. When you get to episode 54 and hear Blue Bird for the first time it just hits so different. Then one of my personal favorite moments when watching any anime was when I got to episode 380 and heard Silhouette for the first time because that song is an absolute banger. This show in my eyes is perfect and I get that this show can be viewed as very long by some people but you also gotta take into account that 41% of this show is filler which equates to about 205 episodes so you only need to watch 295 episode of this and they are all worth it. This is my favorite anime at the moment and I get that there might be better out there but as of right now I believe this is a true thing of beauty",10
"
                I’ve watched at least a hundred of animes and Naruto is the best among all of them. I started watching Naruto back in high school and now that I’m in my 20’s, I still enjoy watching it. I literally grew up watching Naruto and even if most people would say I’m too old for this kind of thing, I can proudly say that I am a full-fledged diehard fan of Naruto.  I can imagine myself still watching Naruto with gray hair and wouldn’t be ashamed of it. 
There’s a very long review coming for this is the review of one of the most famous
                  anime in the history of anime and manga. 
About the STORY
What I love most about Naruto is the story itself. I love how the story goes with every arc. How every mystery unfolds and questions answered, fits the main plot so well. Though the main storyline is influenced with strong drama, the story is made as light as possible. Every arc is packed with adventure, a little bit of romance, a comic relief, somewhat psychological touch, and tons of action. The fact that the story is very much exactly what is happening to the world, every viewer can really relate. War and dispute since ancient times is something that is, unfortunately, still happening up until now. You will see how war brings pain and sufferings and how these feelings make someone succumbs to the darkness.  You will witness how that darkness nurtures every villain in the story. You will also witness how the Shinobi World forced two best friends fight each other. It maybe a cliché scenario but it is still made so original and magnificent that it didn’t become so dramatic or over the top.  The heavy drama that comes with that kind of main plot is something that the viewers can really relate. This is the very reason why anime should not be considered as something that a child should only be watching. An argument that I’ve been struggling to prove to my parents until now. What’s more fascinating is the fact that this one is a lot better than the part I, well not that I love less the other one, but because Naruto and his friends are already young adults. The story is more mature and the main plot is explored more than the previous one where the focus was more on the adventure and transformation of the characters which is still significant because the series wouldn’t be this great if the previous one wasn’t successful enough. In this season, Naruto and his friends are old enough to realize the harsh reality of the Shinobi World and they have to do hard decisions for themselves. Like one of the famous caption in one of the manga’s chapter, “IT’S COMING! SINCE THEY WERE BORN… THEY WILL EXPERIENCE WAR!”. There are no dull or boring moments in this series which is one of the strongest and most important edge of this series from others even from the previous season. Even with the famous animes of today I occasionally get the feeling of boredom or worst just skip some scenes but in here it’s different. Literally, every episode is so worth to watch and that’s even with episode where Naruto is not even present. Lastly, the thing that amaze me the most are the dialogues. The dialogues are very well delivered which is very much rare for any other anime/manga of today. The dialogues in this series are not cheesy, over dramatic, and hypocritical. It is always delivered like it is from what a real person feels which make it so sincere. Especially Naruto’s. They will definitely move you. In my many years of watching animes and mangas, this series have the most admirable and amazing lines and dialogues of all time, one of the biggest reasons why Naruto is so memorable.
About the CHARACTERS
The characters are very much well-explored; you can’t help but have a favorite. You can see how another character influences every action of another. In my lists are the kind-hearted and good role model sensei Kakashi and Jiraiya, the cool and quiet Gaara, the very smart and cool Shikamaru, the rest of Naruto’s friends in Konoha, and of course, one of the most scary and powerful villains among the animes of today, the Akatsuki. In this series, you will see how villains genuinely become a bad guy and not just a cliché reason for doing bad things. You will witness how an individual succumbs to their hatred almost like in the real world. One of my personal favorites is Itachi who has done a lot. He is the epitome of selflessness. Too bad that the truth about him is used by Madara as to manipulate Sasuke and even more hate Sasuke for being manipulated. It’s as if he wasted all Itachi’s sacrifices when he let Madara used him when Itachi never wanted his brother be touch by Madara. By the way, can’t wait to see about the truth behind what Itachi gave Naruto during their last encounter and how Sasuke will react when he finds out.  Madara, who turn out to be the true villain of the series or so we thought as there is still shocking revelations later in the series. As one of the calmest villain yet have a very dark and nasty intention, Madara is one of those truly irritating villains. Lastly, I genuinely love the character of Mighty Guy. He is flamboyant and somewhat serve as a comic relief of the series. But what’s so ironic but most of the times hilarious, is that for some reason you feel assured whenever Guy is fighting. He may be hilarious but he is certainly one powerful guy.
About UZUMAKI NARUTO
If you would look at it more, Naruto has a lot more reasons to hate the world compared to Sasuke. But you see, their difference is that Naruto let others in. Unlike Sasuke, Naruto opens up to others and let them be part of his life and because of that, he grows up with a strong heart and will. Naruto, influences almost every person around him. Although, sometimes I can feel how he can get a little bit hypocrite especially regarding Sasuke. But then at the end of the day I would end up admiring him for having such pure strong will. I guess that’s exactly the reason why people around him change for the good. With regards to this, I love the opening of the series with Diver theme because it very much explains how Naruto survives despite having misfortunate life particularly from his childhood days. Even if saving Sasuke drowns him with so much pain and despair, all his loved ones pushes him back on track so he won’t drown with too much hatred like Sasuke did. Nevertheless, I strongly admire him for having so much faith in Sasuke. Even I hate Sasuke but Naruto’s character manages to justify his unconditional loyalty to Sasuke. His character matures a lot after the death of Jiraiya and the assault on Konoha where he was considered a Hero.
About UCHIHA SASUKE
From being the most famous character of the series, he completely becomes the most evil and extremely irritating villain of all time. And when I say turn of personality, its 180 degrees opposite of his previous character. He really does look like a possess person, from facial expressions to body language.  Sasuke is the embodiment of the word “HATRED”. At the end of every episode you would have conflicting emotions. There’s this feeling where you sympathizes with Naruto for wanting to save his lost friend and there’s this strong feeling of hating Sasuke for being the source of everyone’s agony especially Naruto. I hate Sasuke so much! Hate him for having a weak heart. All he needed was a little push and he was already manipulated. He is so naïve and easily dyed with other’s colors. This is the difference between him and Itachi because despite everything else Itachi walk the path that he believes in. Just for the record, I think Itachi experienced a lot more compared to Sasuke because he was the one who killed all his brethren. Despite that, he did all those things with his own resolve and not because he was being manipulated. That’s precisely why Madara was afraid of Itachi because he can’t use Itachi. I admire people who do things with their own resolve, whether it is right or wrong for others, at least they stand up for what they believe in. Sasuke just nurtured and nurtured his hatred. For that his really immature just like a child. That's why Madara enjoyed manipulating him because his so easy to push.
About NARUTO AND SASUKE
Naruto and Sasuke’s extremely complicated relationship has always been one of the strongest and most interesting parts of the series. Naruto and Sasuke’s suffering since childhood our almost the same, in fact, Naruto has a lot more reasons to have such hatred but because he has a strong heart he managed to survive that darkness. Sasuke maybe be so strong abilities-wise but when it comes to a strong heart Naruto can survive anything. Sasuke is so damn naïve and can be dyed with any color. He is such a brat swayed by his emotions that’s why he is easily manipulated by Madara. On the other hand, Naruto can be naïve also with a lot of things but definitely have a strong heart. You can even consider that he already has a color that defines him and won’t be deceive by others. He won’t let other’s beliefs sway his way of life. Most probably this is the very reason why Itachi entrusted Sasuke to Naruto. Well, I guess at the end of the day I hate Sasuke for the simple reason as being the main source of Naruto’s sufferings but at the same time I also thank him for being the source of Naruto’s strength and strong will to move forward. You will have conflicting feelings whether to hate or pity Sasuke but in my case I hate him 75% and pity him 25%. After struggling to choose, you will realize how deeply involved you are already with the story. Follow the manga version to know the real details of Naruto and Sasuke’s fate and like me you will die in anticipation. I just can’t wait to see who will win, Sasuke who carries the curse of hatred or Naruto who carries the will of fire both from their ancestors. I want to see, if Naruto can really save Sasuke and if he does, I want to see how. Even if it takes many years, I will wait for that destined clash. And I strongly believe that it is one of the most awaited moments in the series that everyone is just dying to see. But still, at the end of the day, I feel so sad that both of them became victims of the shinobi world and now facing each other. It’s almost like a sin how Mr. Kishimoto is able to create such brilliant story. 
About the ANIMATION and SOUND
The animation is just so great and matures with every year. There are always developments and improvements as the years go by. Not all series is blessed with magnificent cool stunts and captivating visual effects. The illustrations and artwork are one of the best. Breath-taking landscapes and amazing looking characters. Oh! Did I mention there are endless heart-pounding and cool fight scenes? Also love the sounds because it’s very ninja-like which makes it the series’ own unique sound.  I even have a collection of Naruto’s soundtracks. Lastly, the dialogue is very original which is very important for me because sometimes the lines are the ones that stays in your mind and would make you remember a character.
I can’t even find a single flaw from this series which is extremely rare when I’ve already watched so many different animes. From characters to animation to music to seiyus to dialogues and most importantly to the STORY, I just can’t find a flaw.  With that all said, I strongly believe that I was able to explain why this anime has been in the number one spot for so many years in my lists of top 100 best animes. For me, this is the ultimate and epitome of anime viewing of my more than a decade anime experience. I’m glad I’ve lived to see such creation.",10
"
                One of the most overrated anime in the century. I understand that the manga could appeal to a lot of people but frankly, the anime was really bad. I have counted in total 223 filler episodes on 500. Don't you think that almost half of the episodes of the anime is way too much? Moreover, 90% of these filler were not interesting at all. I know that they put it there so the anime doesn't catch up to the manga but it was way too unsatisfying. It is because of these filler that I dropped the anime for a long time. The art was not
                  bad, I mean some jutsu were kind of original and pretty.
The OST/Openings were good too. If they had just put the manga stuff, I would probably rate it with 8/9 but the way they handled the anime was bad.
NB: The characters were not really interesting, some characters were really likeable like Jiraya, Minato, Naruto, Shikamaru,... but on all the characters(those that we know the name at least) I was able to like only 5-8%.
NB+: How come Shippuuden has a better grade than the first series. I think the first one is way better.",6
"
                I'm not using that sectioned up rating system because that's bullshit. I'm also not gonna follow all those rules on the right either so there will probably be spoilers in here. I'll write my review my way thanks guys. This is going in my blogs as well. Something's gotta go there!
But oh god, where to begin? I guess with a bit of background. I started watching Shippuden back in the early years of high school when my then friends introduced me to it. The original Naruto was my first ever anime and I watched it in english dub. Naturally I wanted to keep it consistent
                  when I moved onto Shippuden. As the years went on and I carried on keeping up with it, the dub suddenly stopped, but the story hadn't finished. I realised I had to wait. But I didn't want to watch it as it was airing, there were huge gaps between episode releases and even without them I'd struggle to keep track of the entire story for that long. So I gave up. And now, years after the fact, I finished high school, I've just finished college and I notice by chance that Naruto Shippuden's english dub is also finished. So I buckled down and decided to watch in full the thing that has haunted me for 5 years. And hoo boy, that was a journey.
Overall, upon reflection the show feels like 480 episodes of meh with some great bits sprinkled in, followed by a final 20 episodes that might as well be a completely different show, they're so good. My biggest problem with the show is, you guessed it, filler. I must've skipped over 100 episodes worth of stuff, from whole episodes I didn't care about, like all those undead dudes we've never seen before but we get a full episode long flashback about them, or the never ending reuse of old scenes to fill space in an episode. When an episode didn't feature a single flashback, it was a mercy.
There is one exception though. Paradise Life on a Boat. The arc is entirely filler, but it's also the best arc in the whole show, besides the epilogues. It finally lets up the dull seriousness for a while and let's us have some fun. Naruto's shadow clones staging a revolt, mushrooms of death, these are some of the best episodes of the entire show, and they have nothing to do with the story whatsoever. I don't really have a good segway into this next bit, but let's talk about the characters.
I... don't hate Sakura... or Sasuke or Naruto or anyone really. Kaguya's a bit one-note, but gods usually are. I feel sorry for Sakura in particular. She's a great character but she's never allowed to do anything. She keeps saying to herself that she's gonna stand toe to toe with Naruto and Sasuke, but she never does. In the final boss, she does brief support for Obito and then gets one punch in right at the end.  Poor girl. And Sasuke oooo, he pissed me off for a good while but, after seeing his final battle with Naruto, I kind of get it. He's been so wrapped up in hate and revenge his whole life he can't comprehend forgiveness even when it's right in front of him, and it takes Naruto literally beating some sense into him that he's finally able to admit to himself that he doesn't want to sever his ties. That's some damn good character writing and I praise Kishimoto for creating an arc this complex for a character he didn't even want to make originally.
I was never fully sold on the relationships though. Most of the time I felt that Sakura could do so much better than Sasuke, and I didn't really believe the love between Naruto and Hinata, because they hardly ever interacted in the show. They needed to add in another movie right after the ending but before the epilogues to add some much needed depth to their relationship before dropping the wedding on us. Same problem with Ino and Sai too, but those two were more in the background so I don't really mind that they only interacted once in the entire show (that I watched) before that point. Besides, Ino is like the personification of sex appeal to me (remember, I first watched this show when I was going though puberty) so I'm automatically on board with anything she does (or anyone). Feel bad for Tenten though. I really like her and she even admits in the epilogues that she's spent so much time training and never takes time for herself. I wonder who'd be a good match for her. Maybe Omoi? He was fun. Also, the Akatsuki. In particular, Pain and Konan, because I love Pain's character design so much, and Konan because she's an underappreciated badass. Also Deidara because of his fun personality, and the fact that's he's voiced by Sonic the Hedgehog.
I'm glad I waited for the dub. I tend to get really anal when I have to switch between dub and sub, especially when it's a show I care about, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Maile Flanagan will always be Naruto to me, as will everyone else. Dave Wittenberg is inseparable from Kakashi in my head and Neil Kaplan was a brilliantly threatening Madara/Tobi, just to name a few. 
In the end, Shippuden kinda feels like a series of peaks and valleys. The highs are super high, the lows are scarily low and there's basically nothing in between. I hate parts of it and I love other parts, especially the well animated parts. Naruto vs Sasuke is one of the most brilliant and emotional fight scenes I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing, and I'm glad I waited till I was 19 so I can fully appreciate it. There were only four moments in this show that made me cry. One was, what you just read, Naruto vs Sasuke when Sasuke is finally able to admit to himself that he wants friends. The other was near the beginning where Gaara is brought back to life and he's surrounded by the comrades he thought hated him, and the third and fourth were Naruto saying goodbye to his parents. Those were some of my favourite moments of the story, and I will never forget them.
Aaaaannnnd, I think that's about it. I've gotten my thoughts out, something that's been 5 years in the making. I love this show, and I hate it at the same time. I'm probably not gonna watch Boruto until the dub finishes, so get back to me in 2029. Maybe I'll have gotten over my joint crush on Ino and Tenten by then. Going through it, I figured I'd end up disappointed, like, 5 years of waiting for a 4/10, but thank god they saved it. If you want to watch Shippuden, watch it with a guide. This show is notorious for taking way too long to say not very much, so chop it down wherever you can. I skipped as much as possible but it still took me two months to finish. Or, if you watch nothing else of Shippuden, watch the epilogues, they're like Shippuden god mode and are better than all 480 episodes before them put together.  
The only question left is, after all that, what the fuck am I gonna do now? It's all over, I can move on with my life.

                Naruto Shippuden is the successor of Naruto. With it comes the return of the Akatsuki, new power scaling levels, new characters, and an extended history of the shinobi world. It boasts a significantly higher number of episodes than its predecessor. 
A part of me wants to give this anime a 10, but the other half wants me to give it a 6.5. To vaguely describe Naruto Shippuden's quality: ""When the show is good, it's VERY good. When the show has its shitty moments, they really smell.""
Some of the best shonen arcs come from Part 2 of Naruto. 
Things Naruto Part II improves over Naruto Part
                  I
-The art style is now smoother and more simple. This can be taken as a neutral or negative since it's not as stylized as before
-The soundtrack is PLENTIFUL times better than Part I's. Most tracks are beautifully composed and orchestrated.
-The villains are better in Part II. The Akatsuki is officially introduced to its full potential here. 
-More emotional than its predecessor. Naruto was already a pretty emotional show and Shippuden intensifies it.
-The history is very rich. The entire ninja world is developed and makes the setting feel more alive
-Had some of the best arcs in shonen anime: Itachi Pursuit/Battle Between Brothers, Hidden Rain Infiltration, and The Pain Invasion
-The fights and choreography are some of the best in shonen anime
The BAD of Naruto Part II
-Many many MANY plot-holes. They aren't noticeable as you watch the show, but when you stop and reflect, they become very apparent. 
-Characters that got the spotlight are now disregarded heavily in Part II. It focused a lot on the main cast, and not the supporting cast.
-The power scaling got out of hand quick after the 5 Kage Summit arc. Naruto and Sasuke became Gods, which was very unnecessary.
-The longest arc in the show wasn't correctly done and was too dragged out. The main source of plot-holes in the show
-The final villain was awfully introduced. 
As we see, Naruto Shippuden improved on Naruto a lot, but at the same time, did worse in so many aspects that Naruto did right. I'd recommend watching Shippuden if you've already seen Naruto. Personally, I adore the show even when it has obvious flaws. The good overshadows the sloppy writing near the end, and I love it for what it is.",9
"
                You know, to be honest, I stared at this blank slate of a review box trying to discern the best way to start this review. I mean, the first thing you see when you come across the review is the score and the profile picture. And, with all the positive reviews praising this shonen manga, I felt I had to present the other side, an argument forsook and abandoned by many Naruto fans. Now, keep in mind. I enjoyed the manga. The manga was good. The anime is different for a number of reasons, but in some cases I will address both as a whole
                  and the problems I see in them. Also, do keep in mind this is my opinion, an opinion that goes against the Naruto fandom ship. So, if you hate me for it, that's completely understandable, just leave a comment explaining why.
Story (4/10) In a nutshell, Naruto has one of the most deus ex machina filled plots with a hearty helping of Christopher Nolan (aside from the HxH plagiarism, of course).  A bad summary would entail the following: a masochistic, prepubescent ninja sets off on his grand quest to retrieve his beloved rival (whom he shared intimate kisses) and defeat all who oppose his dream: converting Konoha village to the Dattebayo! religion. Well, that really doesnt do the show justice, but the hilarity of it stems from how true it may seem. A young ninja named Naruto whose dream is to become Hokage through a number of deus ex machina and turning each and every villain into a contrived ally. Also, lets not leave out the fact that this is essentially a discount Hunter x Hunter. A young boy sets out to surpass his father (Gon/Killua - Naruto) goes through an intense physical exam (Hunter Exam/Chuunin Exam) where he meets the main antangonist (Hisoka/Oorchimaru) trains to become better while the other character (Sasuke/Kurapika) wants revenge on the extinction of his tribe (Scarlet tribe/ Sharigan clan) for the harvesting of their powers (that one guy with the sharigans in his arms/ everyone collecting the Scarlet eyes). Oh, lets not forget both eyes are special and red. Clearly not downright plagiarism right?
Art (7/10) The art style was very unique. Instead of switching to the crisp, overused layouts as is done today in most anime, Naruto delivers a more Edo-period type feel. For example, compare it to Toei Animation's One Piece and you will clearly see the difference. The series itself leads into a feel only known and beget to the series. Other than that, the fight scenes are well done, yet there are parts which seem a little choppy, mostly because of the feel aspect and not relying on super-crisp animation. Other than that, I love the animation.
Sound (8/10) This is an area of great controversy. The background music, fight music, emotional settings and light-hearted tones fit well within the series. I can definitely concur with that. However, some openings and endings did not fit the show at all, namely Blue Bird and ""You are my FRIEND AH UGHGH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH"" God, <sigh> did anyone else hate that one. Aside from that, the only other problem I have are the voice actors, namely Naruto himself. I usually dont agree with this subject but I sadly find the dubbed version to suit him better than the Japanese one. Not because of the voice alone. The actor/actress seems to fail to capture all that naruto stands for within the voice acting and intonation. Maybe, its because of the script and the use of certain japanese characters which dont fit but the voice actors are asked to improvise the script itself, .....so there. I'm an asshole Naruto fans....forgive me for having an opinion.
Character (4/10) Aside from a specific few, there is very very little character development for a show this long. The show and manga seem to address a huge cast of actors, which they subsequently throw away for the sake of plot progression. I would like to say it pulled of the ""Angel Beats academy of unknown side characters"" but Angel beats is phenomenal and Naruto is older.....hence naruto is to blame and is now the entitled founder of said academy. Look at Shikamaru, look at the rest of the teams. The only thing remediable is their powers, which already is over used and such forth. Remember Hinata's confession and how it was never addressed afterwards by any character in both the anime and manga? Yep, some good development we got here. Also, ughghgh.....Naruto and Sasuke. The whole thing is a sin. It's unbelievable, it goes against Naruto's dream fundamentally, and is essentially a discount Christopher Nolan. The only thing stopping it from being a full-on Christopher Nolan is a bookshelf and someone randomly yelling, ""MUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRPH!"" Good movie by the way, watch it if you haven't.
 Enjoyment (3/10) This is actually going to be the shortest thing I will address because my view on this area is surprisingly popular. The anime is 3/10 because....fillers. By the time Luffy becomes the Pirate King, Naruto would become the filler king. The manga is a 5/10 for the above reasons only...thats about it.
Overall (5/10) In summary, this was a dreadful piece of work. Why? Three main reasons: unplanned, fanservice, and deus ex machinas all over the place. Naruto was not forethought. In the end battle alone, the main antagonist shifted three times!!!! That shouldnt happen. Even if everyone is yelling PLOT TWIST! Nonsense....it is a cop out ending in all respects to writing and literature works. Two. Fanservice. Naruto is surprisingly popular. I really don't understand why. Maybe because of its shonen serialization or its overhyped commercialization....either way its still sinful. The show still hasnt ended, yet the manga has ended over two years ago. The movie ended the manga at a good place, I will give it that. However, now I have to deal with another serialization about Boruto and Co. Freakin money and its crappy influence. Third, EX MACHINAS! This show literally couldnt put more deus ex machinas even if it tried. It's complete crap. The use of tropes and moral punchlines is all wrong. Every good well-developed villain becomes a side-character on the force of good after meeting Naruto. Its awful. Its a Christopher Nolan performance.......of cheesiness and cop out endings and fillers. Also, the fanbase against this argument is toxic. A perfect example is Double4anime. Just watch him on youtube and how butthurt he gets when someone despises his beloved Naruto. Bottom line, would I recommend this show? not the show but the manga, but then I will provide ten more that automatically beat it as an example of ""here's anime done wrong, and here's ten done right."" Phew, that was long. I apologized if I offended anyone with this long digression. If you like the show, thats perfectly ok. However, be aware of the wrong things with it and accept it instead of ignorantly covering your ears and hate spamming. Is my opinion right? No! Absolutely not. This is a biased opinion of everything wrong with Naruto. And although I tried to be impartial, it was still a partial review for which I duly apologize. So, if you feel butt hurt, read a positive review. There's literally thousands of 10/10 reviews out there. So there. I hope you enjoyed it!",5

                I have a love-hate relationship with Naruto:Shippuuden. It is slow, very slow. Dragged, very dragged. The flashbacks are insane. I remember them showing us a flashback of an episode (pretty much 12 minutes out of 20 were a flashback). Luckily, I skipped through that. I play the next episode, waiting for stuff to start happening (instead of the flashbacks). But whaddaya know!! The next episode has the SAME FLASHBACK OF THE SAME EPISODE that I JUST WATCHED in the last episode and took ANOTHER 12 MINUTES!!!! Like what the hell, seriously?!?! Can you milk your audience any better?! 
The only good thing about this anime
                  is the story. The story is extremely interesting. Sad that it was ruined by the flashbacks. Many characters are interesting, but many are just plain awful.
Sasuke is probably the most annoying character ever, along with Sakura. Sasuke always tend to make the incorrect decision. He never settles, from one stupid decision to the other. He is a villain but no one knows. Even though Sasuke is pure crap and doesn't give a single damn for Sakura, this girl still loves him. He mistreats her so badly it is disgusting. But she still loves him. HOW?!?! 
The story was perfect (imo) until the very last arc, which takes up like 300 episodes or something. There was a lot of dragging ongoing in the last arc. But! There was a lot of sudden and abrupt endings. 
I got bored writing this review so I will stop here. Who cares anyway?",4
"
                     Well, if I say Naruto, every one knows what thats mean, fillers, good characters, a story of a lifespan, ninjas etc. So let me rate them one by one.
   First, the fillers. There are a lot of fillers in Sjippuuden, and some of them are too long to tear apart the exciting actions at the main story line. But, and thats a very big ""but"" I enjoyed all of them, it widened the univers, deepened the characters, get you more excited for the main parts or they were simply funny. And one of them actually hits, someone's face
                  reveal (a photographer camuflaged man), I waited 8 years to see that face! 
   Ninjas. They use chacra to empower their special jutsus.
   Chacra: It is a recycling type energy that flows in everything, if you use it, you have to ""heal"" it back with resting/meditating. Chacra is also working as the internet, it connects everithing with everything, can transport information, even matter. And in the end you will actually realise that Naruto is sci-fi.
   There are a lot of characters you will know in Naruto, and all of them develops through the entire series.
   So if you want a fantasy/adventure like sci-fi anime with some hundred episodes full of emotion and characteristics you will get it from Naruto Shippuuden!
   J-score: ★★★★★",9
"
                Story: The story takes place a few years where Naruto has become much stronger, More mature, and Is much happier than within the last series, but That only shows how much Naruto and The rest of the character cast has grown. Naruto is only a few steps closer to achieving his dreams and Becoming strongest in his village.
Art: The art is much better compared to Naruto while Shippuden makes things smoother and cleaner looking. Which is why I had to give it a higher rating, it's much better in animation.
Sound: The sound is just like that of Naruto. It has a great amount of intros/outros
                  and Again! It's too hard to choose which intro or outro I favor the most.  
Character Development: Character development is obviously here as we can see Naruto has grown and Has become a different person entirely compared to his younger self back in Naruto. The same can be said with everyone else. 
Personal Enjoyment: I did enjoy this more than Naruto itself. The fights we're more hyped and energetic, The animation was much better, and We all got to see Naruto mature with his friends and Become someone entirely different. Which is why I gave Shippuden a higher rating as well. 
Overall: Shippuden is PERFECT! As it surpasses expectations and Shows us why Shippuden has only made The Naruto series better with overall time and Consideration creating the next series of Naruto. Sadly I can't the same about Boruto, as that is garbage, but We will talk about that when we get there. 
I rate Naruto:Shippuden a 10 OUT OF 10 
Naruto: Shippuden is a PERFECT anime!
Pros:
Actual Story Progression 
Character Growth/Development
Surpassed My Expectations 
Cons:
There was some filler, but Meh.",10
"
                Naruto Shippuden is a masterful continuation of Naruto's story, and as a series it even manages to improve upon its' predecessor - an anime which already needed little improving, in my opinion. Still, it has its' own drawbacks which will be off putting for some viewers, which I'll go over.
The story provides more of the action adventure found in Naruto, while the plot really matures appropriate to the characters' ageing up. The mysterious Akatsuki organisation establish a threat right from the start, while maintaining suspense through many episodes as each character is revealed slowly, one at a time. These villains provide situations that feel truly
                  perilous for our heroes, and the show packs in a solid handful of emotional gut-punches throughout.
The arcs are varied enough to hold the viewer's interest across a long series, and bring focus to characters other than Naruto; as well as battling Akatsuki members, there are arcs focused on Naruto's training, on Sasuke's activities, or on revealing important mysteries and backstories.
Now, there are still weak points to the story. There are some overpowered techniques conveniently used, such as Izanagi, Rinne Rebirth, or the 100 Healings. Several times characters are saved from certain death by such powers. While this might be an annoyance for viewers at times, ultimately I think Naruto has enough tragedy in its premise and across Shippuden's story, without becoming bleak by piling up too many corpses of beloved characters.
Towards the end the story does teeter on the edge of the trap of 'too many villain reveals': ""I'm the villain- no I'M the real villain- no, fools, it was me all along!"". This isn't Shippuden's strongest hour, but it does serve to add a cool sense of destiny and fated conflict for our heroes, so if you enjoy that kind of element in stories, you won't be displeased. And - ultimately - the real final conflict is the one you knew was coming since the very beginning of Naruto, and when it comes at long last, it won't disappoint. To me, it delivers an emotionally charged and satisfying payoff to a series which I have followed for many years, and it's an arc I am happy to rewatch regularly.
Overall, there are no unanswered questions left at the end, no frustrating ambiguity, and I think it is well worth spending 500 episodes to reach such a satisfying conclusion.
The characters have always been Naruto's strongest asset, and that's no different in Shippuden. Our protagonists have spent time becoming stronger, they're more emotionally mature and (sometimes) wiser. My favourite example of this development across the time skip is Sakura, who really comes into her own in Shippuden. There is still plenty of room for growth for them across the series, and we get to see many of the large cast shine on their own. The histories of some fan favourite characters are slowly revealed, to great effect, any many new characters are added to the cast.
By far and away the greatest of these new additions is that most beloved villain organisation in anime: the Akatsuki! And they're beloved for good reason. They are equal parts intimidating and badass; at times even goofy. They range from sympathetic anti-heroes, to assholes who are having so much fun being assholes that you can't help but love them a little bit. Each member is given adequate screen time to showcase their unique abilities and personalities, but even so, they're so enjoyable to spend time with that it's almost bittersweet to see them defeated; I just can't get enough of watching them.
Of course, within any show, not every character can be perfect, and for me in Shippuden, Karin really takes the crown as the worst character in the entire Naruto-verse. Constantly annoying and adds nothing to the plot. Fortunately she is only a minor character, so we're not overrun with screen time for her. Conversely, the character of Killer B, who I admit I find tiresome at times in the manga, I actually find less annoying and more tolerable in the anime.
The last thing I'll mention in terms of character is the slight pitfall which I think Shippuden falls into during it's latter half; that is a still expanding cast of less important characters. While they retain unique and memorable character design, the addition of a new set of characters from the nations neighbouring the Land of Fire ultimately doesn't add all that much to the story. I think this is because there isn't enough time to develop them much at the late stage of the anime, and they end up relying largely on gimmicks rather than fleshed out personalities (examples are the Fifth Mizukage and Omoi). This just means that if these characters are in peril, it's hard to care too much about it.
The music in this series is absolutely outstanding. There is a new composer, Yasuhara Takanashi, who continues many elements and themes as to feel like a seamless transition between series, while introducing many beautiful pieces of his own, and appropriately badass character themes for many new villains. Some of the most standout tracks of the OST are Senya (or Many Nights), Girei, and Hyouhaku (or Wandering). It's an OST that I have continued to listen to frequently for more than 10 years.
Of the many opening songs, a couple are average; the rest range from good to brilliant. The best ones do their job of pumping you up for the action, and provide an emotional kick for viewers invested in the characters. The best examples of this are Blue Bird, Sign, Diver, and Silhouette. Special mention also goes to Hero's Come Back!!, which was perfectly chosen as the first opening of Shippuden. It you come to this anime after Naruto and aren't pumped already, then this opening does that job for you - the song coupled with animation that includes a really badass shot of the mysterious Akatsuki organisation is enough to get anyone excited.
To note; I watch the English dub, and I enjoy it immensely. I have still watched plenty of episodes in Japanese, as for most of the time I watched it the English dubbed episodes were a little behind the Japanese release; I don't think there's any notable shift in tone or quality between the two, so whichever one you prefer I think will be equally enjoyable. A notable mention goes to Vic Mignogna and Michael Yurchack who both voice versions of a character who is introduced later in the series, and stood out to me as unique and memorable voices for an important character.
There's little to say about the art other than: it's just good. It's pleasant to look at, and the fight scenes are visually exciting. The lines look cleaner than it's predecessor. The palette retains a lot of it's vibrancy, though it becomes desaturated through certain arcs appropriate to the tone of the story, as our heroes face more serious threats and losses.
The main drawback of Shippuden is much the same as Naruto's: an excessive amount of filler. And unlike it's predecessor the filler arcs are interspersed throughout the main story, so if you are intent on avoiding them, it takes a little more effort to do so (i.e. looking up filler lists online). However, I would say that some of the filler is quite enjoyable; the different tailed-beast arcs, Kakashi's Anbu arc, and Itachi's Shinden arc spring to mind. Also, a lot of the filler in later episodes tries to delve into some of the supporting characters, rather than being just meaningless monster-of-the-week fodder. Additionally, some later filler arcs are actually based on light novels that accompany the manga, rather than being anime-only.
Ultimately, I think the filler isn't as big an issue for new viewers as it was for fans watching along as episodes were released (it could certainly make you impatient when waiting for the story to advance, back in the day); but any new viewer can use their discretion to decide whether to watch or skip ahead.
Overall, Naruto and Shippuden have retained their position as my favourite anime of all time since I first started watching, more than a decade ago. I love being immersed in the world and I find the central themes and conflicts to be heartening, and emotionally satisfying. There are several arcs that I enjoy rewatching regularly on their own, and at any given point I'm itching to rewatch the whole series again, filler and all.
For fans of Naruto I think it's highly worth seeing how the story develops and concludes in Shippuden. For viewers who are reluctant to watch Naruto (maybe it seems a little young) and want to jump in at Shippuden, I think it's possible. The backstories of the characters are revisited enough that it's probably not too hard to understand or follow, though I do think you'd be missing out on some critical character bonding from the first part.",10
"
                I do not like this show one bit. Nuh uh. I already hated it once they started doing DBZ shit, because it's Naruto. Naruto is supposed to be ninjas. Instead he turns into fucking fox man McGee and becomes literal Jesus at the end of the series. That isn't what a ninja is. Ninjas are stealthy and cool, not spectacle fighting meatheads. Everything that I liked about the og series was just stripped away with this show. The only thing I liked about the story was the Akatsuki. They were great. Very entertaining, very interesting characters. Pain's arc was also good. I cannot stand the
                  rest of it. If this isn't known by you, I don't skip filler. So I had to sit through all 500 fucking episodes of Shippuden and slowly want to carve my eyes out of their sockets for hours upon end until finally it was over. I'll get into art now.
Art: The art is good. No real flaws and the Pain frames are memed too much.
Character: Hoo boy. I don't like any of the main characters. Naruto is an imbecile who rarely convinces me to like him and Sasuke is the most whiny, bitch-ass, immature character ever. I don't expect them to be perfect, but at least make them develop. What was Sasuke's development? No, seriously. How the fuck did he develop? He didn't. Not at all. ""He became less broody and immature over the course of the series."" That's bullshit. What about him is mature at all? He's a stupid fucking child, through and through, for the entirety of the series. He isn't cool, he isn't fun, he's just whiny. Itachi is 10x better and I don't even like him that much. My favorite character is Jiraiya because he is somewhat interesting unlike the majority of the cast. But you know what they did with him? They fucking killed him. I get that you need to have the mentor die. But come the fuck on. Why then? Make him die in the war. Minato and Jiraiya coming together in the war arc would have been fantastic to see. Also why did Neji die? He didn't need to. That was a pointless death. It did nothing.
Enjoyment: I hate this show. It's long for no reason, it doesn't adapt the manga well, I hate the characters, they stopped doing ninja shit, there are like 200 episodes of filler, Naruto and Sasuke never did and never will entertain me, and have I mentioned that I don't like this show?",5
"
                I enjoyed watching Naruto Shippuuden because I believe it had a very complex story which stood out from any other animes I have watched before.All of the characters had a background story and an episode for it which were usually a bit boring but could sometimes be interesting.I really enjoyed it because although it had side stories it always reverted back to Naruto trying to get Sasuke back.The Naruto franchise also have a very enjoyable sound track in the background for fights,memories or just sad moments.The artwork in this anime was outstanding according to my standards because I like Masashi Kishimoto's  style of drawing
                  when it comes to the hairstyles and backgrounds.In conclusion,I believe Naruto Shippuuden is an emotional and enjoyable anime for all otakus!!!

"
                The beginning of this show starts off great, ill give it a 8 or 9 for the first few hundred episodes. However the show should of ended over a year ago. They had 3-6 episodes left to air as the manga was over and done with. Almost as if they are expecting the show to continue they have been adding fillers, For the most part its 1 drawn out episode then 4-10 filler episodes. The story is great, but the fillers are not, it has became a joke of several of the communities. I do recommend that you watch it, but follow the suggestions of
                  the communities on what episodes to skip. Good story and better artwork then the original, character development was a little bland but expected. Great sequel bad fillers.",5
"
                I should mention that I binge-watched this show and skipped about 95% of the fillers. I will try to keep this review spoiler free. 
Naruto Shippuden takes place about 2.5 years after the events which transpired in the original Naruto series. Sasuke Uchiha deserted the Hidden Leaf Village and joined up with the sinister Orochimaru to gain more power in his quest to kill his brother and avenge his family. Naruto Uzumaki decided to train with Jiraiya in order to improve his skill so he could get Sasuke back to his side. Meanwhile the threat of the organization called Akatsuki drives ever closer, who are
                  out to capture Naruto.
The story is rarely the strong point of a shonen anime. It often comes down to a villain who is drunk on power and who wants to take control of the world. In that regard Naruto Shippuden is not that much different. At the start it’s simple, but effective. Without spoiling too much I found that the story did get a bit too convoluted at the end, but I imagine it can be difficult to try and wrap it all up. 
I will say however that almost each villain has his own unique reason for why they want to achieve world domination. In some cases, I found myself even sympathizing with the villains. The line between good and bad is blurry and often there are flashbacks which explain why a villain has had a change of heart and why he or she has those different ideologies. There are a lot of interesting and tragic themes such as pain, isolation and destiny. These different motivations bring more depth to the villains. 
This is why I found the characters to be the best part of the show. There is the typical shonen protagonist Naruto Uzumaki. He is a total goofball, yet very dependable at the same time. He works and trains the hardest and he has the ability to connect with other people. He’s a good main character and I found myself cheering for him throughout the whole show. Sasuke Uchiha at the other hand is the complete opposite of Naruto. He is “cool”, very talented, all the girls swoon over him, but he struggles with himself and mainly with his past. Even throughout the original Naruto show I found Sasuke to be a very polarizing character. At points I disliked him and at other points I sort of liked him. This trend continued for me in Naruto Shippuden. 
Then there are a lot of other characters, who all have their own powers and weaknesses. We of course have all the Hidden Leaf Ninjas. We get introduced to ninjas from other villages. Some characters from the past get more fleshed out. Finally, we have the villains. I already made mention of the them up above. Pain and Itachi are some of my favorite characters in any anime ever. So, all in all that leaves us with more than 50 important characters. All of them are unique and you’ll find yourself picking favorites for some of these characters. Some of them focus on long distance, while others are hand to hand combat specialists. If you watched the original Naruto you will know there is a big difference between a Shikamaru or a Rock Lee fight. 
The main problem with having so many characters however is that not every character gets developed or his/her time to shine. In the original Naruto show we saw minor characters having proper 1 on 1 fights during the Chunin Exams and during the Sasuke Recovery arcs. They got multiple episodes and often you saw flashbacks of their pasts. This way you got interested in some of those characters and you had your favorites. Because so many new characters get introduced during Shippuden – and since we do not have THAT many villains – some of these ninjas do not get any fights during the whole of Shippuden. This is a shame since I was invested in some of them and subsequently didn’t get to see if they learned new techniques or improved. Their characters in effect didn’t develop much / at all. 
In addition, there is also a bit too much powering up going on to my liking. The fighting, the techniques and the damage inflicted all get turned up a few scales. Some characters even get buffed/evolve multiple times during one fight, which makes them literally (demi) gods. Other characters meanwhile stay behind. I believe this is called power creep?
Another strong point of this show is the setting, the world of Naruto. How someone can come up with ideas and concepts like ninja villages, ninjutsu, genjutsu, kages, tailed beasts and how all that stuff is connected, is beyond me. It’s genius and it’s all carefully laid out and explained in this show. 
Just like in the original Naruto show, the soundtrack is amazing. There are some tracks which will pump you up for another great fight, and there are tracks which will hit you right in the feels. There are 20 different openings and 40 different endings. I’m sure you will find something you like and dislike. Personally, I liked the opening track called Silhouette by KANA-BOON the most. 
The animation is good. It can be a bit inconsistent and there is an obvious change of pace when high action episodes occur. I like the style of animation which gets used during those high actions episodes. It is more fluid, but I could understand if people didn’t like it. The fights and more specifically the hand to hand combat scenes are often amazing; even mesmerizing. I don’t like it though when the animation in openings already spoil upcoming events or matchups. This happened a couple of times.   
I feel like I also should mention something about the fillers. I binge-watched Naruto Shippuden and I skipped 95% of the fillers. I recommend you to do the same. I watched about 80 fillers of the original Naruto and they were mostly dreadful. 40% of the episodes are fillers so look on some website or in the forums here to find out which episodes are skippable. I recommend watching the Kakashi and Itachi focused fillers. They were enjoyable. 
The downside of binge-watching is that some of the repeated flashbacks are skippable as well. There are so many flashbacks in Naruto. It’s insane how often they for example showed Sasuke’s past with Itachi. I get that it’s really important, but they’ll show you the exact same scene about 5 times. If you watch 1 episode per week these flashbacks might be welcome (although I can imagine these kinds of viewers would rather want new and original content), but if you watch all the episodes in rapid succession then I’d say the repeated flashbacks are filler-esque too, unless you have a terrible memory.
Overall, I would say that I really enjoyed this anime. I binge-watched this at a high pace during a somewhat difficult time in my life. I was always curious to find out what was going to happen next. At some point I was thinking about giving this a 10/10, but I decided with a 9.5/10 because of some nitpicking during the final arc. A day after I watched the final episode I just had a bit of an empty feeling as a huge, fun part of my evening and night disappeared. I am sad it ended, but I really enjoyed the ride. Let’s hope Boruto will prove to be a worthy sequel.",9
"
                I have to say, I dropped Naruto for a while and was ready to throw in the towel on the series. Then Shippuuden came along.
The first few episodes in this series show growth in Naruto, something I waited desperately for, but he actually partially regresses as time moves on. Also, there was nothing really interesting happening around him. In fact, the two most interesting story arcs in Shippuuden were all about other characters. And what happens to Naruto while we're given an in-depth character development of a character that we've never seen before, that's not important to the overall plot and that we know will
                  be defeated? Naruto jumps on logs. He jumps on logs chasing a guy whose power is to create clay birds. That's several episodes where all Naruto does is jump on logs, in a circle, trying to catch this clay guy. Yeah...
All in all, Naruto Shippuuden is much like Naruto. It has some great moments, but it's just not worth looking through all the crap between them. Shippuuden seems to have fewer filler episodes and more filler content and bad writing.
It's not the worst anime series out there, but to me it's just a big waste of time.",5
"
                Many of you will maybe be surprised of why i gave Naruto: Shippuden a 10/10, and trust me, i don't understand 100% either...
 To be completely honest, I would never say this was the best anime of all time, my rating is more personally.
Anyways.. 
Story: The story in Naruto is good, and just amazing, no doubt about that. The story never really got boring for me, it kept becoming even better. I would say that it is one of the best stories in anime, and I really recommend watching it if you love good stories.
 Animation: The animation overall isn't bad at all, but
                  when it came to fight scenes it went a little off at times, and the reason for it was simply just for their choice of style in some fights (Which happens a lot in anime, not just Naruto). But most of the fights are amazingly animated, and I'll watch them again. 
Fillers: I know damn well that Naruto has many goddamn fillers, and many of them are below average.. But I really don't want to rate an anime for their fillers, and I don't understand why people trash talk it this much. If you don't like it, then most of them are 100% skippable. Personally I choose to just watch them. And no, I did not enjoy them, but a couple of them were fairly okay.
 Music and sound: The music in the original Naruto is good, but had some that were under decent. In Naruto: Shippuuden all opening are and just the music in the episodes are great. I really liked and enjoyed it all. 
Character: The characters in Naruto is outstanding, i would say it's at least in top 10 animes with the best characters, maybe top 5. All tho the villains and main characters are made greatly, there were some characters that they missed too much potential in, and that really annoys me. The character development is great, but it could have been much better. They really went carefully when choosing people to die, but to be honest, they didn't choose enough. And it could have made it even better. There were too many characters, and so you would have expected a lot of them to die, but apparently not.
Ending: I can't really say the ending was perfect, but i wouldn't say it wasn't good either. It became a little rushed at the end, but i think it worked out okay.
 Sub or Dub?: I watched it in Sub, and i also think Sub is the better choice. I didn't watch dub, but i watched a little of it, and i liked it. They were both made finely. 
Overall: I gave it a 10/10, which is very overrated, i know i know. 
But personally, i can't stop giving it 10. The Anime just hit me differently. 
But if i had to give it a rating outside that, I'll give it a 8/10. Maybe 7,5/10.
Also, the anime was also really carried by the story.
The best elements of the show are the music/sound, characters, story, and personally the plot too, even tho the plot can be basic at times.",10
"
                I don't remember the exact last episode I watched, but this show is garbage and everyone should steer clear of it. I watched every episode of Naruto when they aired starting the year the show received an English dub. I stopped during the final arc of the show. I had highly enjoyed the show through much of it and I don't think I'd take those moments back. 
However, I cannot recommend this show whatsoever to anyone. The studio who made this show MILKED their FANS for money. The manga had been completed at the time the show decided to start running filler in the middle
                  of their final arc. I have spent 7 years watching this show as a loyal fan and I stopped during the final arc. It's because the filler they started doing in the middle of the final arc lasted for over 2.5 years. I waiting 2 years to let episodes build up so my father and I could watch roughly 120 episodes together and binge it hard. There were only 3 canon episodes released within those 2.5 years and the manga had been finished that whole time, meaning the studio was purposely writing 2.5 years of filler to make money from view counts. It's absolutely disgusting. 
Then to top it all off they made the damn Boruto movie before they even finished the Naruto Shippuuden anime. I am so mad and disappointed. I will never watch another anime from this garbage studio again. Save yourself the trouble and watch a different studio's show. They'll probably care more about their fans and give you an enjoyable show.",2
"
                It's good, very good.
It's probably the anime that has inspired me the most after Dragon Ball Z. It's become one of the few happy memory of my childhood and teenage years. 
Story: 9 
Up until the 4th Ninja War the story was amazing, I don't hate the last arc but I don't think it's great.
Art: 7
Pierrot (aside from the movies) animates incredible battles from time to time but I wouldn't say it's flawless animation every episode.
Sound: 10Naruto AND Naruto Shippuden have objectively the best anime soundtrack ever made, period. 
...And the seiyuus are very good, as you would expect. 
Characters: 9
Really like most of the main ones. Gaara and Itachi are arguably one of the best Kishimoto's creations and are portrayed wonderfully in the anime.
Enjoyment: 10
Nothing to add. It's good.
Overall: 10
 Despite the horrible fillers this anime is one of my all time favourites.",10
"
                Good : 
Interesting premise and world, magic system that allows for many enjoyable fights, interesting character designs, characters with relatable motives.
Bad :
-Characters
Naruto :  a)He started as a likeable kid with troubled life that could be overbearing at times but tried his best. He became annoying when he would spout the same things over and over again while never actuall achieving anything , diving head first into the enemy without thinking and getting his ass kicked.
  b)In Shippuden he shed that immaturity and became more bearable.
Unforutnately he still had his dumb moments that completely messed the tone in many instances. His immaturity also clashes with the tone and style of the rest of the series. Characters like Luffy are ok to be ""dumb"" because the whole world of the manga is kind of silly and ridiculous with over the top scenarios, locales and cahracters. Every character on his crew is a bit of a nut in their own way, and many characters in the rest of the series are too so it doesnt feel out of place. But it does in Naruto.
  c)Also he was still an almost useless fighter. Sasuke had managed half a dozen different Jutstus in the 2 year timeskip, Naruto not only learned nothing but he couldnt even do rasengan without a clone.
Apart from Pain he never had a decent fight with an equal oppoenent to show his skills and competence. After that he just uses the Fox which throws most ninja techniques out the window.
-Sakura :
Most annoying character and impossible to like.
Has an unhealthy obsession over Sasuke, even after all his crimes and attempts to kill her making her look like an unhinged ex-girlfirend with Battered Wife Synrome than an independent strong character.
The antics with Naruto where she gets angry and slaps him were never funny, just cringy and annoying making her look like a bitch.
-Sasuke
He started off interesting if a little emo.
He opened up, he made friends, but had to leave them for his own purposes. Ok so far.
Aftet the 2 year timeskip he goes full-on edgy emo and tries to kill them for no good reason. It made sense to abandon them in favor of training under Orochimaru, not kill them.
He puts on a permament poker face being unable to show any emotion at any time.
Plus after al the shit he did, he was forgiven way too easily.
-Hinata
Annoying too high pitched voice even after she became a teen, too timid even for a timid personality, too obsessed with Naruto, barely any good interaction between them.
-Karin
That was a big missed opportunity. After she as almost killed by Sasuke her dialogue made it sound like she realised the truth and would forget Sasuke coming to her senses. She observed Naruto and how he was so much ""brighter"" than Sasuke. Given how they were also form th same clan it was a ripe opportunity for interesting character development betweeen them.
Naruto could realise he was not alone, Karin the same. They could become close, bond over their troubled childhoods and support each other in the coming battles.
But her character was wasted and the very next scene with her, she just still craves Sasuke's dick for some reason.
-battles :
That was hit n' miss.
Some fights, especiallu the early ones were interesting with various strategies and techniques being used in creative ways to make dynamic battles.
While however some characters like Sasuke or Shikamaru were given interesting fights, the protagonist himself Naruto most of the time had lame ones. Others like Lee, had onnly brute force but ultilised it in the same way we see Chackie CHan and other artists use it in fulm so it was entertaining.
Naruto offered none of the 2 : neither brain fights nor strength fights
He usually just used brute force instead of his brain, even when the opponents were much stronger and it was obvious it wasnt working.
He never learned any elements to supplement his arsenal, he never improved upon them.
HE learned th wind elements which he used to create his super rasengan and then he totally forgot about it. he didnt create any new technique that was less dangerous than that.
He went from 0-100 with no in-between.
Towards the end, the ninja fitghts are almost gone and we just have gods playign with each other so...whatever.",6
"
                First review so don't expect it to be super.
Naruto: Shippuden is set two and a half years after Naruto leaves the Leaf Village to train with Jiraiya and the overall story starts off from that after the main villain the Akatsuki were beginning to move out. This show gets a lot of hate mainly because of the ridiculous amount of fillers which is nearly half the show, some are enjoyable and give more depth to a character, others are completely pointless and totally random. But once you get past that the show is nothing short of excellent, amazing fights, beautiful soundtrack and a pretty great
                  story until the final act of the show which gets a little too out of hand. The art is nothing to write home about but it doesn't disappoint except for one episode, when you get there you'll know it. 
This shows main theme is bonds and how Naruto must overall protect his bonds and strengthen them to gain allies and become stronger. The characters are well fleshed out and all given clear motives for each one and excellent backstories are put into place here. The lore is also only enriched here and everything is more developed as all mysteries were explained and answered well and the best is yet to come.
Overall this anime is worth a watch as long as you've completed the first part and can either handle filler or just decide to skip it all together. That's not to say at the end it stumbles, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime as it was my gateway into all the anime I watch now and I still come back for some nostalgia.",8
"
                Naruto is an amazing anime that everyone should enjoy.
The story is just amazing, they have such a great focus on all the character, you will definitely like every character, and not only the main people. Also they use the ""set up pull off"" technic very well, there are a lot of surprises along the way aswell whitch will definitely take you off guard. I have been emotianally toutched many times in this anime, which was not something that I thought i would be when I first started watching it.
The music is simply amazing, both the intro and outro songs, but also the random songs that
                  gets played. It is absolutely amazing and really helps the atmosphere.
As far as i know, this is one of the best anime that is out there and it is definitely worth watching
If I should point out some of the bad things (which there are) then it has to be that there are so many episodes that it is starting to look like it will never end. Also there are so many fillers in there, and it can get kind of enoying at times. 
I wil highly recommend Naruto and Naruto Shippuden to anyone",10
"
                Story:
You can break the story of Naruto Shippuden down into one sentence.
Naruto's best friends Sasuke Uchiha did fall on the ""dark side"" and Naruto himself is a great bro so he does everything to bring him back without ever givin up.
Sounds pretty boring doesn't it? 
Well while the story progresses the whole thing gets a lot more complicated. Naruto and his friends would have to face several ""bad guys"", train a lot to be able to beat them and lose a lot of precious people (very emotional! :( ) and the great thing about it is that everything actually connencts.
Talking about the bad guys...they aren't
                  actual bad guys and this is something I liked a lot about Naruto. Usually they are just people who had a really rough live and therefore developed some ""bad"" but pretty logical philospohy.
For example one enemy believed that it is impossible to understand one another except if everyone understands one another's pain. And to understand pain you must experience pain so he became the bad guy to spread pain over the world. During Naruto's fight against that person they had quite an interesting philosophical conversation- something that the series does a lot. 
The only negative aspect about the sotry is that some of the so called filler episodes (episodes that don't really provide anything to the plot but are pretty important to have a deeper understanding for the character's development aka episodes that you won't find in the Manga) are really bad placed. 
For example during one of the most intence arcs of the show we got Fillers from OG Naruto- without any logical reason!!
My personal opinion is that you should still watch them but you can decide that for yourself (there are filler lists in the internet).
9/10
Art:
On one hand some of the greatest most memorable fights in Anime history and some really weird animations due to outsourcing of the animation studio but overall pretty solid. 8/10
Sound:
Let's be real on this one. Naruto Shippuden's OST is one  of the greatest of all time.
Just listen to these:

Characters:
Even though there is a ton of characters in this anime you will know every single one after finishing it and that's a fact. 
Why you might ask?
Well simply because all of them are very interesting and most of them have quite a depth due to their past and their actions during the story. 
The characters will stick to you and if you actually think about them you might learn some valuable lessons about life.
Enjoyment:
I loved it and felt a vast emptiness after I finished the series and the movies.
Overall:
For me a 10/10. Simply because I am emotionally very attached to this Anime.",10
"
                This review contains my biased opinion
Naruto for me is a classic
This is the anime that got me into all the anime's I watch now
Story is good, The fights are pretty cool, character design is alright 
Maybe some of the Arc's are drawn out, but I don't mind
I do wish the quality be slightly higher but maybe that's asking too much
I feel like the amount of episodes can be trimmed down slightly from removing the filler Story 8
Art 9
Sound 9 or 10
Character 8 maybe 10
Fights and regular enjoyment 10 
Overall a 9
Definitely recommend watching Naruto Shippuden if you haven't.",9
"
                Naruto Shipppuuden has a spectacular story with well built characters. I am not only talking about the main characters, but also secondary characters and especially the villains.
Not to mention that it has the best fighting animations ever seen. Not only the animation at technical level but the own choreography and strategies of the fight according to each individual and its power.
The story has many ramifications and variants, which despite one and another plot hole (which is understandable because of the extended time of its development) every each character evolve and go through a growth and development of character.
Naruto is that character that we can understand
                  and we want to be like him. We see his growth, it is not a character of 2 dimensions, but of 3 or 4. The same happens with many others, and the most fascinating are the villains. Especially those from Akatsuki. For me, Pain is one of the best-built villains I've seen so far in anime and even in movies.
I quoted this anime on my master's thesis countless times, exactly because of its story and character construction, and also because of its animations and fight choreography.
Anyone who loves a good fight (choreographically and visually) will feel immense satisfaction in this anime. Just like anyone who likes a good story with good heroes and good villains, both quite human. They do not make the characters just the flawless hero or the inhuman villain. No. The characters have a reason that moves them, because of their life experiences.
I strongly advise.
My favorite anime, no doubt.",10
"
                So, Shippuden which translates to hurricane legends or a wild tornado and some shit, and that is what this part of naruto is, a wild cyclone that makes Naruto's peaceful life of training with Jiraiya into a wild war after he came back to his hometown. 
In very short he comes back after his training with Jiraiya. He is welcomed by his friends and his wounds reopen after remembering how Sasuke has left the village and done what he has. We learn everything about Naruto's past, we learn all about Naruto's and everybody's past, we get to know the real people behind the crimes and
                  wrongdoings, in general, the plot advances, and well does Naruto become the damn hokage? watch to find out.
The story is that of a shounen's simple enough for a baby to understand but very fun and perhaps carries some emotions at times. 8/10 because the war arc really just took so many episodes and it was quite bad, I would give it a 7 as an arc and a 5 in comparison with other arcs, it was more concerned about action and commercial stuff instead of the story, basically characters fighting for 130 episodes and some drama, rest if very good.
The art style is just legendary and the quality quite good, it has not been too much time since Naruto Shippuden ended but the quality was on par with its times even when it started. 8/10
Sound is an 8, It had more good songs than the original Naruto but it just had so many songs that it was impossible for most not to be very bad. It had quite some good openings and some good endings but it also had many bad ones that balance it out. For example blood circulator, silhouette, blue bird, Diver, Sign, Distance, Lovers, Totsugeki Rock, Moshimo are just some of them, there are 2 times as many endings and out of all of them one I listen to commonly is ending 27 because it is a banger. Overall very good openings and some endings slap, some others are just quite average. 8.
The characters are a 9, legendary but if we take any nostalgia or motives away they are very bland and only some get much care. 
Overall Naruto Shippuden was the climax of the Naruto series it had so many good things but it also had some flaws, more than the original naruto. It was not too boring but it had some not that exciting parts as well. Overall good but also a bit bad, it just was incosistent, expected of a 500 episode anime but although it was overall great, it had some inconsistencies I can't exactly forgive that much, I think this is an 8.5 (9).",9
"
                Minor-Major spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pls read to the end and everyone is intitled to their own opn but this just need to be said. There are two parts . one about the fans another on the show pls enjoy
Naruto fans are blinded by nostalgia or just only look at the good things abt it. They are 10-13 year olds that saw Itachi once and put him as their wallpaper , pfp ect and phone watch the show in Dub and was the only anime they ever watched and give ever show a 10 or 9.
""Naruto"" gets soo much hype for no reason. I am going explain the good
                  and bad things about the show. The good are first, Naruto has amazing fights and also have one of my top 5 favorite villains (Pain).But the cons out weight the pros,"" Naruto"" as a series has a hard time following all of the characters, and its a good thing to have a lot of side characters because you my relate to one but towards the middle and end of the show most are thrown to the side so Naruto and Sasuke. But what really annoyed me was how gifted Naruto was, in the beginning of the show Naruto had only the 9-tails but in the end turns out he is a reincarnation of a God and was destined to succeed.",6
"
                Review 20: Naruto Shippuden (Our favourite hero grew up?)???
Well, well, well he's returned to our screens once again. But did he mature??? 
No 
Is he smarter??? 
No Did his brightly coloured strange outfit change at all??? 
NO
Another fun loving Anime program following on from the original Naruto series. We see our favourite hero returning after 2 years training with his sensei.
He's still loud and annoying, but for once everyones happy to see the demon child that is Naruto. Unfortunetly for his long time freinds he still poses that pervy, hot naked chick move which still freaks me out on a mild level.
Well Sakuras still the same to!!! Apart from the fact she's turned into a mini Tsunade, once again creepy on a mild level. Turns out in the years Naruto was training he became a great healer just like Tsunade.We see in the early episodes of Naruto Shippuden that even Tsunade's training may not be enough for some forms of healing. Her appearence has changed ever so slightly,the clothes follow the same colour scheme and fashion from the previous episodes, but I thought she would start growing her hair again for Sasuke, but it seems the shorter look has stayed and will be there to stay for a while.
Apart from this she's literally the same person, a few slight alterations inher wardrobe have not altered the fact that whenever Naruto goes off of task... She's there to hit him. (Obviously)...
With enhanced graphics and a slightly older audience to watch this series of Naruto it seems perfectly normal to me to jump straight in like they have. You know, introducing new characters and meeting up with past members of the Naruto series.
I have to say, I did start to watch the original Naruto series but became bored as i'd already read it. So I thought to fit back into the crowd I would start watching the series again. Good decsion for once.
I do think this series is better than the original. I think the only reason I think its better is because, well they've grown up, so its as if people my age can relate to the characters that we love. It may seem weird but it is true. 
I know younger kids at my school who prefer the first series to Naruto Shippuden as they can relate to him and the situations he's in.
I don't think Naruto's personality has matured or grown up with him. I think its the appearence and the voice that make him seem older. I actually like this element of Naruto as I prefer his characters to be this way, the series wouldn't be the same if he was smart and sophisticated 24/7. I'm glad with te decsion to keep him as a wacky nut job instead of a stuck up tight wod.
I prefer the aged Naruto to the younger one who always wanged to become hokage. Therefore I prefer Naruto Shippuden to the original Naruto series. (Sorry to offend anyone)...

"
                Oh, Naruto. An anime that you never thought would never end.
I've seen shonen anime like this where it's essentially a story about someone wanting to be something in their future, as well as something more compared to others who have tried.
Part 1 dealt with the whole idea of strategy vs talent. It made you feel inspired to go out into the world and essentially be who you want to be and not be limited by anything out there. The concept of it's possible no matter what anyone else says.
Shippuden aka Part 2 is different and in that, it's focus was more on the world of
                  Naruto rather than the actual character. Sure, Naruto Shippuden has interesting characters but the focus was obviously more on how they were (their backstories) rather than their present life. Sure, events transpire and they're still awesome to look at.. but when you look at it, it's like Naruto Shippuden became more interested in adding characters rather than actually developing them.  Sure, they did but it felt very slow. It's not something bad just something. Quantity over Quality even though Shippuden does have its moments. In fact, this whole idea of Shippuden being very different and somewhat lost what made it special reminds me of the shift from the first 3 Fast and Furious movies all the way to the ""now"" which are completely action with less racing.
The only outward thing I can say about Naruto Shippuden is that it's a lesson on how a writer can have problems when something they've created has become so huge that it's completely messy. Don't get me wrong, I like the characters as well as the overall story. But the way it was told was a little slow. Not only that, but this particular show is littered and cursed by filler. 
It's technically a meme that Naruto Shippuden is known mostly by its messy filler in between the stories that make it good and to be honest, that's what sad about it. Naruto has always been a story where you can pretty much feel emotion running through you especially since the writer/author is good at conveying emotion through his fights. However, because of Shonen Jump's harsh schedule, it ruined his draftsmanship and overall, ruined the anime. 
Nevertheless, Shippuden is undoubtedly a phenomenon. With iconic villains and characters as well as notable abilities and moments with amazing conclusions in its stories. This had a great finale to something so huge that it can be comparable to Harry Potter's Deathly Hallows and the MCU's Endgame. 
Every segment in Naruto is an event; An idea that Boruto or any anime might never, or might not be able to replicate ever again. It's an anime that meant to a lot of people and it will never be forgotten. However, like life itself; it had to end. And while it ends, you can feel the emotion through each final episode. And it shows that the writer, while he had his flaws, is truly a talented and amazing writer. Thank you, Masashi Kishimoto.",8
"
                Look, I get saying the filler brings it down if you watched the show as it aired; however, I am blessed with watching it after the airing has completed. I skip all segments of filler and only watch ones that a well-liked. I think if the show is watched as I am watching it now, it is the single best anime ever created. It has fantastically deep and dimensional characters, the fights (while I see why others think differently) look gorgeous, and lastly, it truly puts the time into forming the plot and doesn't feel rushed. Lastly, I feel its incorrect top judge Naruto and
                  Shippuuden separately, if watched in a single stretch the events of Shippuuden feel perfectly written and well played out.",10
"
                This has been a Journey. For everyone who complains about fillers what I suggest is that you watch them and then complain about the series having a lot of fillers because I too complained about fillers at first but most of them were funny af. Still had to say that amount of filler episodes and flashbacks were a lot. Though what I say is give it a try. His journey from a Baka to a less of a baka needs to be experienced XD .The one thing people say like The female characters of this show have been nerfed but I don't think so yeah
                  if a character is weak it is weak it has nothing to do with gender a lot of female characters have been empowered but I do agree but all of them were not used perfectly .I'm sure you'll like Naruto-kun's journey and feel like proud parents whenever he does something great or even cry sometimes. This was hell of a ride. ""The tale of Naruto Uzumaki"" has been wonderful in my opinion.",10
"
                After an endless wasteland of anticlimactic resolutions, I would like to express the disgust I have towards this work. ''Naruto'' prequel laid the foundations for this story, which although they stood out in some sections, in others they seemed really questionable, and Naruto Shippuden resolved my doubts.
I will expand on 3 points.
1: How does the Ninja World rank system work?
They come out of the academy and are Genin, fine (""fine"", since ordinary people hire them to do necessary jobs like mowing the lawn and doing chores), then they have an exam to be chunnin, fine (""fine"", since really at no time are the genin given
                  time to learn shit and learning is left to the Jonin in charge, which proves to be inefficient because ""muh one of them is my favorite and I'm going to train him, what fuck the rest"").
After the chunin exam comes the jonnin exam... I guess, we're not shown how it diminishes since you're a chunin. And what the hell is up with the Hokage? It is already canon at this point that Naruto skips two ranks and becomes the president. Why? For being the messiah?
If you think about it further, the organization itself doesn't make any sense:
1- You are in the academy, you learn the basics
2- You graduate and you are a genin, you do not study and it is intuited that your education from here on is self-taught.
3- You want to be chunin, so you take the exam, and it is intuited that you must know at least some espionage technique or something similar, apart from several Jutsus and a decent fighting technique (are there even libraries where they can study more techniques?)
4- Magically you are Jonin, it is assumed that you are practically one step below the president, you are the standard military force of your village and yet they put you in charge of rookies so that these are your team in missions that due to your rank do not correspond to you (I suppose they will have missions on their own, but it is made clear that the team that was under his command will be with the jonin for a long time until they are promoted to jonin or become academy professors, then what the hell was Kakashi doing with Minato, Obito and Rin if he was already a Jonin at that age?)
5- You are an AMBU, a member of the village's tactical operations squad, basically Team 6 of the Konoha SEALS, or cannon fodder according to the anime. What the hell did the AMBU do if not die every time they appeared? They are a literal joke.
6- Finally you get to be Hokage, apparently here you only need the approval of the elders of the village to be. You don't have ministers or subordinates, it's just you taking care of all the paperwork and paperwork.
From smallest to largest:
- Why doesn't the Hokage have official subordinates to take care of the paperwork?
- Why leave the heart and the operating system of the village in charge of a single person?
- Why should he be the most powerful and capable man in the village, since in times of crisis he is the one he should protect?
- Why isn't the village in chaos? Clans are supposed to exist and they can wish well for their people, the head of each clan should be sucking the elders' vagina and the malnourished nepe to ensure a position as Hokage and safeguard his clan from power. Internal wars cannot be happening because of that stupid government model.
2. The characters; There are so many characters that were introduced, with so many, I mean TOO MANY, that it is impossible to focus on all of them or focus entirely on one among so many subplots and a contrast is created with the lost potential, by contrast the ""Characters"" that are it gives them a main focus they have their own reasons for doing what they do and who they are as a whole and that's what makes each character distinctive in their own way minus that some have really anticlimactic resolutions that hurt the writing of these, this mainly in the last arc ""Fourth great ninja war"" this last arc felt bland and insipid, constant changes of morale between different characters that felt forced, constant nerfs to characters that were initially excellent. Add to that, innumerable plot holes, the story is full of script holes, things that are left in the air never to be mentioned again, important fights resolved by deus ex machinas.
I can represent all this as a shooting star, the work started out great, but that brightness vanished in the blink of an eye
3. Technical section. This is usually precarious and inconsistent, with all this I mean the little use of visual narrative as a resource for exposing ideas, apart from all this, the technical values ​​never seemed remarkable to me, you usually have a fluid animation and an inconsistent drawing for later become inconsistent in these two sections, and that in those static shots, I could never understand what was meant by all this.
(I'm just a casual with a critical eye, I don't take my opinions to the extreme like others would. I don't pick on animation or subtle issues with technical values, I give more value and merit to the script, I look at the bigger picture. So, being that said, please note that this factor will show up in my review).
Critic's Rating: 5. It's a regular series with big spikes in quality mixed to mediocrity, I'm not a reductionist and appreciated the intention of the series to pretend to give us something ''Good''.
Después de un interminable páramo de resoluciones anticlimáticas, me gustaría expresar el disgusto que tengo hacia este trabajo. La precuela de 'Naruto' sentó las bases de esta historia, que si bien destacaba en algunos tramos, en otros parecía realmente cuestionable, y Naruto Shippuden resolvió mis dudas.
Me extenderé en 3 puntos.
¿Cómo funciona el sistema de rangos del mundo Ninja?
Salen de la academia y son Genin, bien (""bien"", ya que la gente común los contrata para hacer trabajos innecesarias como cortar el pasto y hacer quehaceres), luego tienen un examen para ser chunnin, bien (""bien"", ya que realmente en ningún momento se les da tiempo de aprender una mierda a los genin y el aprendizaje se lo dejan al Jonin a cargo, el cual se demuestra ser ineficiente porque ""muh uno de ellos es mi favorito y lo voy a entrenar a él, que se joda el resto"").
Luego del examen Chunin viene el examen Jonnin... Supongo, no se nos muestra como se asciende desde que eres chunin. ¿Y qué carajos pasa con el Hokage? Ya es canon para este punto que Naruto se salta dos rangos y se vuelve el presidente ¿Por qué? ¿Por ser el mesías?
Si lo piensas más a fondo la organización en sí no tiene sentido alguno:
1- Estas en la academia, aprendes lo básico
2- Te gradúas y eres genin, no estudias y se intuye que tu educación a partir de aquí es autodidacta.
3- Quieres ser chunin, así que tomas el examen, y se intuye que debes saber como mínimo alguna técnica de espionaje o algo similar, aparte de varios Jutsus y una técnica decente de pelea (¿hay bibliotecas siquiera donde puedan estudiar mas técnicas?)
4- Mágicamente eres Jonin, se supone que prácticamente estás un peldaño por debajo del presidente, eres la fuerza militar estandar de tu aldea y sin embargo te ponen a cargo de novatos para que estos sean tu equipo en misiones que por tu rango no te corresponden (supongo que tendrán misiones por su cuenta, pero se deja en claro que el equipo que estuvo a su mando estarán con el jonin un largo tiempo hasta que asciendan a jonin o se vuelvan profesores de academia, ¿entonces que carajos hacía Kakashi con Minato, Obito y Rin si él ya era un Jonin a esa edad?)
5- Eres un AMBU, miembro del escuadrón de operaciones tácticas de la aldea, básicamente el equipo 6 de los SEALS de Konoha, o carne de cañon según el anime. ¿Qué carajos hicieron los AMBU si no morir cada vez que aparecían? Son un literal chiste.
6- Por último llegas a ser Hokage, aparentemente aquí solo necesitas la aprobación de los ancianitos de la aldea para serlo. No tienes ministros o subordinados, eres solo tú encargándote de todas las gestiones y el papeleo.
De menor a mayor:
- ¿Por qué el Hokage no tiene subordinados oficiales para encargarse del papeleo?
- ¿Por qué dejan el corazón y el sistema operativo de la aldea a cargo de una sola persona?
- ¿Por qué debe ser el hombre mas poderoso y capaz de la aldea, siendo que en momentos de crisis es a él a quien deben proteger?
- ¿Por qué la aldea no es un caos? Se supone que existen los clanes y estos deberían desear el bien para su gente, el jefe de cada clan debería estar chupandole la vagina y el nepe desnutrido a los anciantos para asegurarse un puesto como Hokage y salvaguardar desde el poder a su clan. Guerras internas deberían estar ocurriendo por ese modelo de gobierno tan estúpido.
2. Los personajes; Son tantos los personajes que se introdujeron, con tantos, digo DEMASIADOS, que es imposible centrarse en todos o centrarse por completo en una entre tantas subtramas y se crea un contraste con el potencial perdido, por el contrario el Los ""personajes"" que son les da un enfoque principal, tienen sus propias razones para hacer lo que hacen y quiénes son en su conjunto y eso es lo que hace que cada personaje sea distintivo a su manera, excepto que algunos tienen resoluciones realmente anticlimáticas que dañan la escritura. de estos, esto principalmente en el último arco ""Cuarta gran guerra ninja"" este último arco se sintió soso e insípido, constantes cambios de moral entre diferentes personajes que se sentían forzados, constantes nerfeos a personajes que inicialmente eran excelentes. A eso se le suman innumerables agujeros en la trama, la historia está llena de agujeros en el guión, cosas que quedan en el aire para no volver a mencionarlas, peleas importantes resueltas por deus ex machinas.
Puedo representar todo esto como una estrella fugaz, el trabajo empezó muy bien, pero ese brillo se desvaneció en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.
3. Apartado técnico. Esta suele ser precaria e inconsistente, con todo esto me refería al poco uso de la narrativa visual como recurso para exponer ideas, aparte de todo esto, los valores técnicos nunca me parecieron sobresalientes, suele tener una animación fluida y un dibujo inconsistente para luego volverse inconsistente en estas dos secciones, y que ahí de esos planos estáticos?, nunca pude entender lo que se quería interpretar con esto.
(Solo soy un casual con una visión crítica, no llevo mis opiniones al extremo como lo harían los demás. No me meto con la animación o cuestiones sutiles con valores técnicos, le doy más valor y mérito al guión, Miro el panorama general. Entonces, dicho esto, tenga en cuenta que este factor se muestra en mi revisión).
Calificación de la crítica: 5. Es una serie regular con grandes picos mezclados con mediocridad, no soy reduccionista y aprecio la intención de la serie de pretender entregar algo ''Bueno''.",5
"
                If the whole anime was like Pain's arc, it would score 9, but the first arcs are pretty boring to watch and Ninja War is easily one of the worst anime arcs around, and the anime simply abandoned all the good characters from the Classic to focus on the beast drama between Naruto and Sasuke, besides having introduced several interesting characters throughout the plot but that didn't do any good in the end, and even characters that were initially well written like Obito, were spoiled in the end with the classic Discourse no Jutsu. One thing that also bothers me is the fact that they
                  haven't explored almost anything in Naruto's universe apart from Konoha, and even in Konoha some things were left out like that political arc right after Itachi's death.",5
"
                NB: Recommended to watch Naruto before Shippuden. Because this is a continuation if did not know :)
Naruto has been out for years for as long as I know but I never intended to watch it. Everywhere I go and talk with people about anime they will know about Naruto, both those who watches anime and those who dont. My thoughts were quite ignorant and I judged it for being overrated and being popular because its a long watching series, thats all. Until last summer where I binge-watched this B*cth within 2-3weeks. And I can swear to you, it was a beautiful journey where I felt
                  so sad that it ended. I regret somehow, and even wish I tried it earlier. No sugarcoating! Dont let the earlier episodes animation lure you to drop out because the quality is a little low, if you compare it to those high quality anime series NOW.  Ok enough rambling about how good it makes me feel :) 
The good:
Story 10:
The more you watch it the better and better it will be. No point in this series where the excitment, storyline, and pace drops down. Even at the begnning was already very good. I cant believe the author made this story where all the stuff connected to each other and gave meaning without being forced. I myself believe there is no plotholes, only amazing writing and how the characters interwines with the story so much.
Character 9:
Sooo many amazing character with deep and amazing background. You will get the feels and sadness for them, even though you have not seen much of them.  Cool, cute, amazing made characters in this series, where you will enjoy the good and bad characters. The reason for why I gave it a 9 instead of 10 is because when most of them are that amazing, those with a little less character or personality, with background will fall down the list very low. You might even dislike som of them cause they feel so useless compare to the others character you know or like.
Sound 10:
The voice acting here is top notch, all of them are suitable for their character. And I love the way whenever they call out for their jutsu. The music in here is legendary for me. From epic, emotional, sadness and sorrow to happiness or the feeling of nostaliga. Beautiful made and brings out the act of the very scene very well. You are gonna be a fan of the music even when you have not watch naruto yet. 
Art 9:
When I give the art 9/10 I am being a little bias here, cause sometimes you can notice the quality is not always top notch or even that good. Sometimes its amazing animation and quality. Other times you can notice the difference of this epiosde and that ep, thats the problem, when Im nitpicking. And the earlier episodes have not that great art if you compare it to the later episodes. Of couse it should be understandable since its older, so its a good thing that there is improvement.    
The bad:
Nothing is perfect and I tell even my most favorite anime is not. Naruto has it flaws and that is the the bad thing. Lets call out for those jutsus 
1. Filler jutsu, as fans calls it. Naruto its quite well known for being the king of it.  And the amount of it is massive, thats a whopping 44% filler, if I have not recalled it wrong. Some of it was nice to have, but sometimes its downright cruel  when you are in the middle of something big and they take you on for a 30 eps journey of filler. Good thiing its finished so you can just skip over those, I recommend to watch some of it though, if you are a hardcore fan.
2. Flashback jutsu. The use of flashback in here sometimes brings out tears of sadness and feels that hits you right in the face. But on other occasions when they show you the flashback of something so many times, it will lose it purpose. I think that was the shame of it on smaller occasions. Other times when flashback is used because the producers are perhaps scared that the viewers have forgotten scenes that they have watched for some episodes back or the ones you JUST WATCHED. And they show you the characters remembering the memories, the bad thing in this is that it has happened before where the character uses A WHOLE EP for that purpose. Thats enough complaining.
Overall 10:
 I mean overall this was a wonderful anime, and I want to share this happiness and joy to as many as I could. I recommend this to be watched in your lfetime, and its strongly recommended by a very picky person.  Pardon me if there are some grammar mistakes :) Do take me serious though :D",10

                Resting after surgery to prevent amputation of the left foot was an experience of agony and suffering.
 Away from work, friends, and the desire to continue to exist due to melancholic crises engulfing my states of mind, body and mind, I found in Naruto the peace therapy I needed. Watching 40 episodes a day, it was the drug that anesthetized my pain and entertained my loneliness.
Sometimes I felt like Rock Lee, a boy who due to a genetic disease is unable to be a normal ninja, but even so through absolute effort and dedication to training, he keeps his dream active through a will to
                  win. Or like Neji, who as a member of the warrior part of the Hyuuga clan is destined to serve the noblest part. Becoming someone indifferent to fate, until a punch to the chin changes his perspective.
Much empathy for the villains, who are often just children abandoned by their parents and adopted by their nations, as instruments of war due to their exceptional abilities.
 Kishimoto - author of the work - through his characters assumes the positions of father, grandfather, brother and or teacher. Naruto is a great deep motivational speech about how hard life is, and people need to have the strength to overcome it, which I needed at that time.
In Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, the ninja world is a constant war between humans and their traumatic lives. Orchestrated by battles of jutsu, kunais, shurikens, swordsmen, clashes of giant animals, colossal demons inhabiting the bodies of young people and a lot of flashback, while the soundtrack makes a point of tearing every tear from your eyelid or stretching every inch of your lip through smiles in moments of happiness.
The exaggeration in praising the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke with constant reruns and memories, good characters becoming extras, the inconstant animation and the exaggerated fillers weaken the brightness of their journey.
But it would be impossible, not to be grateful for the story and appreciate its great deeds and characters that welcomed me when I needed it most.
Thanks to my experience with Naruto in 2017, the 2020 quarantine is a simple Tentei compared to the great Maito Guy.
SINCE I WATCHED THE SHOW AS A ONE, ITS THE SAME REVIEW FOR BOTH ANIMES.",7
"
                As someone who watched the original Naruto anime growing up, I found myself enjoying Naruto shippuuden a lot.  I recently got back into anime, and decided to finish one that I never got around to from my middle school years.  As I watched the show, I slowly went from an overcritical skeptic, to a cautious optimist, to a Naruto fanboy.  Like so many characters of the show, Naruto had won me to his side, for a variety of reasons.  
The strongest part of the show has to be its music, in my opinion.  It had many great openings, ending, and
                  a fantastic soundtrack.  Some of my favorites would be OP 3 - blue bird, OP 16 - silhouette, and Hyouhaku just to name a few.  The OST would almost always perfectly complement what was happening on screen and add to the emotional impact in a meaningful way.  My only gripe with the  OST is that with 500 episodes, it gets tiring hearing the same thing over and over, even if the songs are excellent.  
Naruto shippuuden's art is very interesting.  For the most part, each episode has the same aesthetic, but, every once in while, the viewer sees an incredible, bad ass, brutal fight.  Shippuuden has many great fight scenes, that shine on a technical level. 
The story is fairly straightforward, Naruto is on a quest to save his friend Sasuke, but life throws a few curveballs at both Naruto and Sasuke.  Without giving too much away, the story is better than most, but shippuuden has a bad habit of lagging.  What I mean by that is that, it takes time for the plot to progress.  I should also mention the filler.  The amount of filler in shippuuden is very high, but seeing as the show is now over, I highly recommend to the reader, that they skip the filler.  In the beginning we could expect the filler only in between major arcs, but towards the end, the anime gets a bit heavy on filler, and it ends up obstructing the action and displacing all tension from earlier.  You are only doing yourself a favor if you skip the filler.  
The characters of Naruto shippuuden were a big part of why I enjoyed the anime as much as I did.  I was already attached to the cast from Naruto, but shippuuden did good job of furthering development of some of my favorites characters.  Not just Naruto, but seeing Shikamaru, Jiraiya, the nine tails, Sasuke, and Itachi grow was something I really enjoyed seeing.  Unfortunately, shippuuden also neglected some original characters as well, such as Sakura, Lee, Ten Ten, Neji, Kiba, and Asuma.  Nevertheless, I always found myself invested in someone on screen.  But, the FINAL villain, was really stupid, I did not care for that person, but the fight was enjoyable to watch at least.  
I mentioned earlier that Shippuuden won me over, and that is very accurate.  I laughed, I cried, I cheered for my boys as they fought the good fight, I was floored by the badassery that occurred on screen, and there were times when I cursed out villains and their schemes.  I think that Naruto and Naruto shippuuden are shows worth watching, and that despite their flaws, continued to be a great source of enjoyment for me.",8
"
                This is my first time writing a review but i will try my best.
Well so first what i wanna say that since everyone tastes are different so some people might not agree with me. But its okay. Naruto is a good anime. Many people hates it and many people loves some people think that this anime is average. But i actually like it. I talk about two things here that's the negatives and the positives and at the end of the review a final verdict for it. First a quick summary. I will try my best not to give any spoilers.
[size=90]summary[/size] :- The main character
                  is Naruto Uzumaki. And the story is simple he wants to be the leader of his village means hokage because he wants the villagers to recognise him. Everyone in his village thinks he is a monster and see him as nothing but a brat.
Story:- Well Naruto is an overall good anime. For me its one of my top anime i ever watched. It was my first anime too. I already wrote the quick summary of it so you now have a bit of knowledge for it. The best thing i found about Naruto was the enjoyment. The enjoyment it gave me no other anime entertained me that much. It has its own positives and negatives i can't deny that. I found the story of it quite simple but it was enjoyable. I wouldn't say that it has the best storytelling but its still good many other anime does this better. Some people complain about the flashbacks well True but i think flashbacks are necessary here. The story is connected with their flashbacks there are character who has their own tragic backstory and if you want to understand them you have to watch the flashbacks it goes for villains too and why the villains became villain you need to know their backstory and than you will understand the story that's how the story was created theres a villain (antagonist) behind a villain. And that villain is the one who made the other villain a villain well it cofuse right but that's what it is you will know that when you watch the anime. I found almost every flashbacks good my favourite are [spoiler]Itachi's and sasuke's [/spoiler] story. Other flashbacks were also good but i felt a bit bored in [spoiler] obito's[/spoiler] backstory but it was still good because he was one of the villains. You might say what connection does the main story have  with flashbacks like i said before if you want to understand the maim Story you need to watch the backstory. Every backstory connects with the main story the same goes for the main character he has a backstory too.
Character:- Well characters are not great but still they are good there is a lot of characters but all of them doesn't get enough screen time and one of the main secondary characters is pretty useless and was almost the whole series but became a bit useful at the end of the story the same goes for others all of them has decent character development. But i didn't focus on the secondary characters that much because i didn't think that was necessary if i know the main story and female characters many people says the female character were annoying maybe some of them but i didn't find them annoying or entertaining they just weren't boring. But when it comes to the main characters they were great and entertaining 
Sounds:- Sounds were decent except for some OST's and OP, ED some of them are my all time favourites.
Animation:- The animation was good. I won't say that it was great and top tier. Because Naruto never fucused on animation it was action anime so the fight were absolutely one of the best in all of anime.
Positive:- The positives are its fighting. And the overall enjoyment. Its doesn't have the best animation or the best sounds well hear me out first its sounds aren't the best but they great. But it did good at what it should its fighting the fightings are easily top tier nobody can deny. The characters are overall good and i think you will enjoy almost every main secondary characters except one because she was useless almost the entire story. But others are great and their personality too. 
Negatives:- Well it has a decent amount of negatives too. Its fillers and its flashbacks also the amount of time the other characters get. It has good amount of fillers but if you don't wanna watch it than just skip them if you are like me who only cares about the main story than you can skip it. Now the flashbacks well yeah as i said before you won't quite understand the main story if you skip the flashbacks more importantly the antagonists. Almost every antagonists have their flashbacks and the flashbacks shows why the turned villain. And the flashbacks are connected to the main story. If you skip the flashbacks than at the end of the story you might think why did this villain did this and you might won't understand some of parts of the main story. It has some plot holes too but if i talk about it than i have to give spoilers so that's entirely a different thing. And for the characters just don't care about them.
Final Verdict:- After reading all of this you might say that why did i rated it as 10/10. Well true. But that's because enjoyment. I never watched any anime that gave me as much enjoyment as Naruto. I watched Hunter x Hunter and Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. Hunter x Hunter has better power system than Naruto and a better storytelling too. Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood has a better storytelling than naruto. But all of them are nothing compared to Naruto when i think of enjoyments. Maybe im being biased here. Since Naruto was the first anime ever watched so its nostalgic. But im a person who cares about personal enjoyment over anything else. Because of the enjoyment i never noticed all of the other negatives and mistakes. Some people also compare about the fact that sometimes Naruto talks with antagonists, tell them that what they are doing is bad the shouldn't do it and nicknamed this as talk no jutsu. I didn't care about this actually because i don't care about such if it was entertaining 😅. If you are someone like me who only cares about the main story then skip the fillers. Some people might not have same opinions and tastes as mine but that's okay. That was all i had to say. Hope you enjoyed stay frosty.
For alternative recommendation:- Watch bleach, Hunter x Hunter.
So that was all i had to say guys. It might be a bit big. But i had to make it big to tell you the reason's why i like this show. It was my first review so i hope you enjoyed this. If you read the full thing than thank you very much.
(Sry for my bad English.😋)",10
"
                This anime is very emotional and can get both women & men to shed tears routinely.  It has some of the best music of any anime.  The fighting is masterful involving different types including physical - taijutsu, mental - genjutsu and supernatural - ninjutsu all beautifully choreographed.  It has some of the best fights ever in anime like the mystery coffin man vs the Shinobi Alliance.  But the best part is this anime has some of the best plot twists in anime history.  At times you will feel like this anime lied to you for the longest time but you
                  will eventually love it when the truth is revealed.
Everything about this anime is top notch from the story telling to the music to character development of both minor and major characters.  Just be sure to look up which episodes are fillers and skip them altogether to best experience this anime.",10
"
                The story of Naruto Shippuden continues where part 1 ended, the main plot of the series consists of Naruto trying to bring his friend Sasuke back to the village and aspiring to become the next Hokage. While the story may seem basic you truly feel attached to the characters and the story and want to know how the story will conclude, this could be due to how many episodes the show has. The show has some very high points for art and it has some pretty low points but when the show wants to it can look phenomenal. Honestly, I believe this show has one
                  of the best soundtracks to any anime, all the songs can either make you feel insanely hyped up for a fight or even make you severely depressed (i.e. Sadness and Sorrow). I might be biased for enjoying the characters as much as I did, simply because I started watching Naruto when I was 7 years old and seeing him grow up at the same rate that I did really create a sense of relatability and overall made me more invested in his journey to become Hokage. It is clear by the end of the show that most characters are pushed to the back and Naruto and Sasuke really take center stage, but even so, every character still felt real to some degree. Personally, Naruto is one of my favorite animes despite its flaws and I would highly recommend watching the show!",9
"
                This Review Contains Spoilers, read at your own discretion:
Ah, Naruto Shippuuden, what could have been a great sequel to the amazing show that was the original Naruto. Now don't get me wrong, Shippuuden was fantastic up until Post-Pain. The writing was fantastic, several plot points had been tied up and closed, and the Akatsuki were essentially reduced to nothingness. But in that lies the problem. After the Pain arc, not eliminating the Akatsuki by leaving Obito alive dragged the story for the next 260 episodes, with a near infinite amount of filler in between.  And when we finally get to the meat of its
                  climax during the War Arc, Madara is suddenly trashed as a character, betraying Obito, ruining a Madara vs Hashirama matchup, to symbolize the passing of the torch to Naruto, who should have fought Obito alone, as Obito is essentially Naruto if he failed at his life. To make matters even worse for Shippuudens writing and enjoyment, the notion of a character we had no foreshadowing of in Kaguya emerges. Kaguya or the Otsutsuki clan were not described until the SOSP had bestowed Naruto and Sasuke his power, detracting from the severity of the situation. And the wrapping on top, Neji. Oh, Neji. Why did you have to die? There was no reason for it in the story. The only reason one could think of is to kill a character the audience was attached to in order to bring interest back into the arc, when in fact it did quite the opposite. Ultimately, Naruto Shippuuden is like a cake. One that was prepared well in its prequel of Naruto, only to be left at too high of a temperature for too long in the oven. A total wreck.",6
"
                ONE WORD. LEGENDARY.
I totally fell in love with the anime. the story, characters, and sound effect. Also i recommend watching Naruto before Naruto Shppuden, cause you might wonder and have many questions, even though with time there will be some flashbacks, but i wonder if that's enough. Yes, Naruto was a little boring, there nothing new, its fights and everything. but atleast theres some info about naruto's past.
I started watching Naruto only because of a post where the kid naruto is saying he doesnt have anyone at home who will wait for him and there was a second pic where there his child is saying
                  "" where were you, i was waiting for you''. I means the first pic was from the vey first episode of Naruto.
anyway. i dont think i can tell anything without giving any major spoilers. but its different and amazing. but theres many arcs of filler episode. dont always skip it. naruto shippuden is indeed big 3 title deserving anime.",10
"
                Naruto is the typical story where friendship will allege everything, now put that with 200 filler chapters and a plot that constantly contradicts itself, the best it has without a doubt is its soundtrack and in some moments its animation, Naruto has many failures and he is late many times, making late plots, like Sasuke's, when it no longer matters, Naruto is recommended, but only if you don't see the filler, because counting the filler naruto is a bad anime, that only its popuradity It saves from being forgotten, even if it has good characters such as Shikamaru or Jiraya, in some moments it transmits
                  emotions such as sadness or emotion, but they are rarely because there is almost always a failure in the plot that aurrinates it.",5
"
                Naruto is my favourite Anime of all time it is because of Naruto that i like anime as ,much a si do now so with that said this review is going to nbe very biased but its my review so i can do what i want ;)
This show has far surpassed my expectations of the first series.The storyline is so informative and powerful there's nothing you won't understand if you watch every episode accordingly.I love that all the characters have grown and the action is even more defined and EPIC!This has made DBZ look terrible in comparison.The story can make you laugh,cry,get angry at the
                  bad guys and more.The one thing I do dislike is that they re-show the same parts over and over again in flashbacks but since they do add other sides to the story we already know it makes up for it. If you're a anime junky that is only satisfied by great action and a strong storyline look no further here it is! 
before watching Shippuden it is a MUST to watch part 1 but honestly if you havne't watched Naruto yet and are feeling put off by the filler sand what you have heard online then all i can say is give it a watch and let me know how you feel once you finish it.",10
"
                So, this was the amazing Naruto: Shippuden huh? What a ride...I watched Naruto when I was little and I finally had the opportunity to watch Shippuden. The first Naruto was amazing, the Zabuza arc, Chunnin exams arc, Orochimaru invasion arc and Tsunade’s search arc where totally amazing. Those were awesome and well constructed arcs showing very good character development, story and epic moments. But, was Shippuden’s arcs the same? 
——————-
Story: 8/10
——————-
The Bad: 
1. Fillers
Yes, the fillers are also telling stories. Maybe is not cannon but this is the anime, not the manga. The thing is that easily, Shippuden would had only 375 eps instead of
                  those 750+ were the half was just fillers. Pierrot wanted money huh? Don’t get me wrong, there are some fillers that are really enjoyable, but the most were horrendous and stupid.
2. Pacing Issues
This anime in some moments suffers of some slow pacing moments that may confuse the spectator of how fast or how slow the story is. Well, also considering that has 750+ episodes.
3. The Final
Sadly, Shippuden has an awful ending and maybe one of the worst finals and arcs I have ever seen in my life watching anime and reading manga. The last arc was just so painful, to the point were Kishimoto was lazy or wanted to rush the final. Because the last arc ruined the message of the series and also a good villain. Additionally, there are a lot of power ups and null character development. Also ruined a lot of characters progression and overused some characters to the point were they were broken.
The Good:
1. Arcs
Yep, Shippuden’s story is pretty good, showing us more content of Naruto’s journey to become a Hokage. Showing us outstanding arcs like the Pain’s arc, were the character development, story, evolution, construction, villain phylosophy, fights, sad moments, epic moments were just incredible. There are more arcs that also are really impressive, but the most brilliant one is Pain’s. 
2. Characters that move the plot 
There are some characters (not everyone) that controls the plot and move it to the direction they want. And this is an awesome thing. It reminds me of Hisoka Morow from Hunter X Hunter, who also directions the plot to everywhere he wants. Well, the exact same thing happens in this series. 
3. Themes, ideology and philosophy
I have to say that the themes, ideologies and philosophies of the characters/villains are just historical. I have never seen a show with such themes. In the first “Naruto” animation, the main theme was loneliness and how it destroys you. But in “Naruto: Shippuden”, there’s more themes and also well constructed. In philosophy, the philosophy of certain villain makes him one of the best villains I have ever seen in a shounen. My favorite villain is Meruem from Hunter X Hunter, but this certain villain is also as good as Meruem’s philosophy. The ideology of all the villains are splendid, they all have different ideologies that makes them historical and remarkable.
4. Fights
As a shounen anime, Shippuden is one of the best in terms of fights. The animation was not that good, but we see ideological fights and well constructed fights. All the fights make sense. But there’s one issue with one of the main character that makes one fight with: “How did he didn’t win?!” or “How is he not dead?!!”
——————-
Art: 7/10
——————-
Studio Pierrot is characterized as an studio that has just a “decent” animation. I totally agree with that. There are some parts in the anime were the characters doesn’t even blink and they keep standing there if like nothing has happened. While there are some parts/fights were the studio think: “Yes, I’m gonna put effort in this one”.
——————-
Sound: 9/10

The music in this anime is just amazing. There are a lot of themes that are just so damn good and if you hear it another time, you will definitely recognize it. Why I’m not giving it 10/10? Because sometimes the music repeats himself until the scene finishes, and it’s a little tedious.

Character: 6/10

This is the part where I know almost everyone known that there are a LOT of wasted characters. While in the first “Naruto” animation the characters were well constructed and with bases, like Neji and Lee for example, in Shippuden, they ruin it. Just the protagonists and some secondary characters have development. The reason that this is not lower is because every character is different from the other. They are all unique, but it doesn’t mean it has good development. There are a lot that are completely wasted.

Enjoyment: 9/10

Even thought Shippuden has a lot of issues with characters, animation and some arcs, the enjoyment was really high. It will keep you watching this until the very night and maybe almost without sleeping.

Overall: 7.8/10

I still think that “Naruto” is better than “Naruto: Shippuden” but is still a great shounen series. It’s a pretty good shounen that deserves to be one of the “Big 3” in the anime (Alongside with One Piece and Dragon Ball). My favourite shounen of all time is Hunter X Hunter, but still Naruto: Shippuden is still a great series recommended for everyone.",8

                if only there were less filler episodes it would have been better.
The fillers made original story to drag out.
I think that Naruto should have spent little more time with his parents.
It has one of the most emotional scenes in my opinion which is his goodbye to his father's spirit.
Overall it was an enjoyable ang nostalgic anime.
Hence they shouldn't have ruined it's legacy by making a crap boruto.

                Extremely stretched without any valid reasons.
Let me start with this , Naruto is a extremely good series and a piece of work which will make you fall in in love with this medium (anime) but only if you watch it when you are new to anime , Naruto was my 3rd anime and watching it felt so good that i binged naruto and naruto shippuuden withing 25 days but then slowly slowly i started watching more and more anime and after a certain time when i thought back about naruto i simply started feeling that this is nothing special and is simply overrated (which is
                  pretty understandable) and unnecessarily stretched. There are other shows which people say are copied from naruto like black clover and even jujutsu kaisen but here is the thing, these shows actually did everything right which naruto didnt and they didnt give us 200 fillers neither did they stretched the story for a decade.
 I did rate the series a long time back and i dont intend to change the score because at that time i actually enjoyed the series a lot but if i have watch it again then i would say i will give it a 6 out of 10.
other than that naruto has played a very crucial role in increasing the popularity of anime  across the world so it actually do deserve credit for that.",8
"
                Warning: This review contains some spoilers!
Naruto, one of the most popular anime out there and one of the most discussed shows too, inspiring passionate discourse even to this day. Despite being far less popular in Japan compared to it's other shounen contemporary One piece, its better produced anime adaptation has propelled it to equal or even greater fame in the international community. However, unlike One Piece which mostly sticks to a tried and true plot structure, Naruto's plot is far less organized, being largely without direction in it's first part and with bits that drag out, seem contrived or don't entirely make sense towards the
                  end. The discussion around the show too is rather unfocused with a lot of the discussion being power level talk, meme tier analysis of characters and largely uninformed takes on the animation. Despite the lack of broad consensus on its messy plot, I do believe that Naruto develops coherent themes through its run. Perhaps this review/analysis will have ideas that have been said before but looking at the state of discourse surrounding the show I'd like to try to change people's opinions on some aspects and offer my perspective on it having finished it fairly recently.
Perhaps the main draw of Naruto is in its worldbuilding, with it's ninja villages with buildings of modern looking architecture but wrapped up in traditional Japanese mythos and aesthetic. The ninja in Naruto don't exactly perform the same role as traditional ninja, serving more as a sort of militaristic force. These military villages engage in a sort of power struggle not too unlike nations in our own world. But in the ninja word of Naruto, the villages seek to arm children to use in their fights and even turn them into weapons of mass destruction by sealing powerful spirits in them. Indeed, the Ninja world is one stuck in vicious cycles of hatred, where acts of aggression leave survivors who seek retribution which in turn leave their own seeds of hatred.
The show explores its themes of imperialism and the circular nature of violence through its two main characters, Naruto and Sasuke. Though they've both been through difficult circumstances in the past (despite being just kids), Sasuke is consumed by hatred and his desire for revenge while Naruto remains empathetic. It's this empathy in spite of suffering that is the driving force of the show. From Zabuza to Gaara to Pain and Tobi later in the series, Naruto is able to conquer his own hatred and reach out to those consumed by hatred themselves. Through his empathy he offers an alternative to the extreme measures his enemies are forced to adopt, and by believing in Naruto, they believe in the idea that the ninja world can get past their differences and mutual hatred to reach a common understanding.
Naruto reaching out to his enemies is dubbed as ""Talk-no-jutsu"" and is dismissed as one of the quirky, illogical failures of Naruto. But in my opinion, empathy beating hatred through Talk-no-jutsu is the entire point of the show. There is also a belief in the fandom that Naruto was fated to become hokage, having immense power and being a reincarnation of one of the founders of the ninja world. As such, the anime goes against its own message in the first part that fate doesn't matter and that anyone can achieve what they wish for if they don't give up. However I think that the revelation of Naruto being a reincarnation is meant to convey a theme of defying fate rather than being a blessing for Naruto. As reincarnations of Indra and Asura, Naruto and Sasuke are fated to fight to the bitter end being locked in a curse of hating each other through multiple lifetimes. However Naruto is able to make Sasuke accept his way of doing things and breaks this 'curse'. Though this is a bit of a weaker point, I also think that Naruto is able to become hokage not due to his strength from being a Jinchuuriki or reincarnation, but because of his empathetic nature allowing him to bring peace to the ninja world.
There is also a question of how Sasuke is perceived by the fandom. Sasuke becomes Orochimaru's accomplice but is able to obtain use of his resources and improve his abilities without being taken advantage of. And Sasuke isn't really wrong in his decision to seek revenge on Danzo when he learns that he was responsible for nearly wiping out his entire race. In a sense Sasuke belongs to same class of characters that fictional villains like magneto belong to, in that his beliefs are right but the plot requires him to do evil things in order to undermine his rebellion against established powers in the ninja world. While I like the message the series tries to push with Naruto beating his opponents with empathy, it isn't really realistic and Naruto is only able to accomplish what he does thanks to his main character power. Through Sasuke we see a somewhat more realistic take on the story, a flawed teenager trying to change his flawed world.
Finally we get to the production aspects of the show. In my watch of Naruto I saw some of the worst as well as the best bits of animation I have ever seen in anime. In particular, I loved the work of animator Norio Matsumoto. He was responsible for some of the best fights in Naruto like the famous Rock Lee vs Gaara fight as well as many others and also the controversial Pain fight. Norio tends to simplify his character models a bit in his work and also incorporates exaggerated squash and stretch movements that are more often seen in western animation. These exaggerated frames are often taken out of context and used to mock the animation in the show. While I'm not fond of his work in the Pain fight, his work on the rest of the show is absolutely top tier so I've always found the mocking of his work really distasteful. He possesses an amazing talent for fight choreography and is able to pull off extremely difficult bits background animation. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Naruto anime wouldn't be what it is without Norio Matsumoto. Even aside from Matsumoto's work, there are plenty of other talented animators who have worked on the show and I think every animation enthusiast who is into anime should give Naruto a watch. I've even heard stories from animators all over the world who've watched Naruto as kids and been inspired to take up animation as a career partly due to the show. So for people who say 'read the manga' I heavily disagree, just skipping the filler episodes should give you an enjoyable anime experience.",8
"
                TBH the art and sound was beautiful but they don't factor into my overall score.
Naruto Shippuuden suffers the same flaws its prequel faces without even talking about the fillers; it's got too many flashbacks. Having 3+ flashbacks of the same scenes that just aired last episode is not a good idea; you're just wasting air time and so obviously saving budget at the cost of quality.
Next, Naruto suffered from TOO MANY CHARACTER flaw like Fairy Tail does in that it starts to become distracting as the focus is taken off the protagonists and onto the side characters. Shippuuden however ADDS MORE characters to the show;
                  most of which won't even be all that influential or significant to the story. They're literally just there to fulfill a key scene or fill a vacant spot.
Naruto has a bad trope of escalation tactics and using growth of power as indication that a character is growing internally. It is certainly entertaining in the mindless shounen department but in a substantial review judging its overall quality, Naruto doesn't hold up well.",4
"
                Like so many other people have said, both Naruto & Naruto Shippuuden had the problem too much filler and it kinda baffled me when I was first watching the show but now that I have finished I am so grateful for the extra filler. The show is amazing and absolutely captivating to the point where when I finished the 500th episode of Shippuuden it felt like it was gone too soon.  Each and every ark is enjoyable and watching Naruto and his friends grow as time goes on is a heartwarming experience. Being able to now go back and watch filler episodes that I
                  skipped when originally racing through the series to finish out what happens next is a blessing because I get to learn more about this incredible universe.
I have watched anime that is enjoyable and anime that has provided me with a wide range of emotions, but no other series has amazed me to the point that this one has. Very well done from the studio behind this series.",10
"
                After almost 4 months I'm finally done watching Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. I really liked the first series and I was looking forward to binge-watch this sequel. But I have to admit I have mixed feelings about this. I'll start my review with the few good points this anime has:
STORY
The plot is very well crafted. It's funny because the first series ends with a three-year time skip to prepare and train for a specific event. But the story in this second part changes completely after the introduction of new characters and plot twists, with a new level of world-building, more complex storylines, and a more
                  mature tone. Each storyline fits well with the overall story, and some backstories and motives are gradually revealed, helping with the intrigue and mystery for the most part. It's nice to see how each arc feels different. It's not like they are constantly increasing the stakes or giving us epic fights all the time. It takes some episodes to cool down and at the same time build-up to the most important parts of upcoming arcs. Even though it gets really stretched out and over-the-top on the second half getting close to the finale (which I had a lot of issues with it, but I'll talk about that later), but it has its epic moments nonetheless.
CHARACTERS
Just like the story gets darker and more complex, the main characters have great development and you can see how they are more mature than in the first series. They are not the same reckless, annoying kids. Most of the characters have enough screentime to develop their arcs, and we get to care about them when they are dying. Even characters that I found annoying in the first series I like them now, like Sakura for example. Some side characters have an amazing impact on the story, and their respective arcs develop and close really well. 
Of course, there are a few new side characters that I hated and I wished they were killed off every time they appeared on screen, like Karin or Suigetsu. 
SOUND
The music is pretty good, nothing extraordinary, but it fills the scenes very well. It has it's heavy, frenetic rock songs for the epic moments, thrilling and sinister songs for suspense and mysterious moments, and sad songs for the emotional and heartbreaking moments. The typical shounen music. 
One song that I want to highlight is during a certain fight scene where, instead of playing battle music, it plays a heartbreaking song that fits the feeling of betrayal and sorrow of the character.
The voice acting is also on point. Each character has its own personal tone, and they get enough emotion when the scene needs it. There are also characters that have an amazing voice, that no matter what they say, they sound really good, like Madara.
Now the negatives:
ART:
Not exactly a bad thing, but I need to point it out. Visually, the quality is very irregular. It varies from incredibly dynamic (in very few battle sequences), to decent most of the time, to very cheap and bad. It's easy to tell when an episode is animated or drawn by different artists because even the style of the lines or the color palette changes very often. As I said the best animation is in the action sequences. These are very dynamic and intense, especially when they involve hand to hand combat. But they are rare, happening once every one hundred episodes.
PACE:
The pace of this show is really slow. It drags too much during most arcs. What can be told in one or two episodes takes four or five. The conflicts are action-packed, yes, and they get their proper build-up. But once the battle starts, they hit each other, then one of them makes a monologue, then hit each other again, then we see a two-episode-long flashback in the middle of the fight, and then they fight again and the battle is over, just for another battle with higher stakes to start right after it.
The overuse of flashbacks does not help. Around 40% of the anime is filler (which I totally skipped), and the remaining 60% is the main story, but 20% of that main story is just flashbacks. We constantly see full scenes from past episodes and recaps, sometimes taking a whole episode's length just to tell us something we already know.
Just to put an example, the ""final conflict"" starts around episode 320 and it literally ends in episode 458 (with a lot of fillers in the middle). And even though it has it's epic moments, it's just the enemy outsmarting the heroes with every move, getting even more powerful each time the battle reaches a fake climax and making it seem like it's about to end, just to start again with even higher stakes and more flashy superpowers. It gets really exhausting. I binged watched this part not because I enjoyed it, but because I wanted it to end soon. And even when this arc reaches its true conclusion, it ends in the most anti-climactic and disappointing way possible.
SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS:
I don't know how to call this subject, but what I want to talk about is the chakra, ninjutsu, and all that weird stuff, which is my main problem with this series. For starters, I'd like to say I actually found it very interesting how each character used their chakra in different and unique ways, and that's something I enjoyed from the first series. But the problem in this second part is that sometimes these characters get overpowered to an absurdly high level. They get powerful enough to do absolutely anything, even becoming immortal, resurrecting the dead, or create massive asteroids to destroy everything. I don't really know how all this works, but it seems anyone can become some sort of god. They say the Jinchuurikis are powerful because they have a special type of chakra. But then these get easily sweep off by some random, powerful dude. There's also no apparent limit to the amount of power a character can get because even when they are running low on chakra, they suddenly develop or create a new Jutsu, more powerful than anything we've seen before. And even after they use that superpower and get considerably ""weaker"", they keep fighting using powerful jutsus.
The battles feel also really different now. In the first series, each encounter was filled with tactics and strategy, and each character used their chakra and unique jutsus to take advantage of the situations. But here the fights are reduced (I don't know if I should use that word) to rap battles between ninjas showing off who has the most powerful Jutsu. We even get to see Mechas and Titans fighting. It's literally as if the author said ""Oh, you think this character was powerful? Then watch this guy power up!"", ""Oh, you thought it would be that easy? Then watch how this boss fight enters stage 2!"", ""You though the enemy was outsmarted? Then watch him move to plan C, D, all the way to Z every time the heroes make a move!"", ""You though the series would end here? Then watch how I stretch it even further with some over-the-top, random new threats that have nothing to do with what we've seen so far!"". As I said above, the only good battles are the hand-to-hand combats, but they are very rare.
While I praised the development some characters received, I have to admit I have a serious issue with the villains of this series. They are uninteresting bad dudes with extremely powerful Jutsus and crazy abilities that seem to defy all rules of this world. The only interesting villains are the ones that turn out to be not truly evil in the end or are evangelized by Naruto, and then they die, with a few other exceptions (like Kisame and Sasori). And while a lot of people seem to love Madara Uchiha, I have to admit I hated him and found him really uninteresting and absurdly overpowered.
OVERVIEW
While I don't love or hate this anime, I find it an entertaining show with some interesting storyline and characters, great fight sequences intensified with a good soundtrack, and a continuously expanding worldbuilding. It also has some really emotional death scenes that made me tear a bit, and that's something I can't ignore. BUT the pacing issues, op characters, and over-the-top battles made this show difficult to watch at times, especially after the second half of the series. And even though I didn't like the final arc(s), the last two episodes (478 and 479) were somewhat emotional and they hit me.",7
"
                NARUTOOOOOO... eh.
Naruto starts off in a direction that I simply wish the show had continued following. Ninja train to complete all manner of jobs, some straightforward, some shady as heck including paid assassinations. Somewhere along the line, they became nothing but dull shonen stereotypes, magic wizards with a Japanese twist. You can call them ninjas if you wish, but they're just punching wizards, powered by friendship, who exist solely to protect their pals.
 Yes, Naruto IS a shonen anime, but I remember way back reading the manga for the first time, I felt like it was going to take a darker route. I really don't
                  like how the series ended. I never expected it to become some edgy murder fest, but...the need to redeem almost every single bad guy? It's lame, it takes any tension you might feel out of the story when you know that any enemy that gets enough fan love, will eventually help the good guys. The worst offense was what they did to the Kyuubi. The idea that at any time this raging evil with nearly unstoppable power could finally break loose if Naruto was pushed too far, that was cool. Now he's a talking pet dog.
Anyway, if you want a rather generic, if pretty well done series, Naruto isn't bad as long as you skip the filler episodes. Of which there are Many. 
  If you're looking for a story where the author wasn't afraid to take chances, this probably isn't for you.",6
"
                It's hard, to sum up in words my experience watching Naruto Shippuden as a whole. This story is so in-depth and complex and just follows such an emotional, beautiful storyline that will have you falling in love with a multitude of characters. Alot of the characters have in-depth backgrounds that leave you speechless and sad. But, It's not just sadness this show has you feeling. This show leaves you flabbergasted with the amazing fights that show the pure determination of the main character. It's so rejuvenating to see how far Naruto himself has come since the original story. It makes you feel almost like a
                  proud parent.  This story also had me laughing a lot of the time and even smiling from the goofy antics in this story.
This story is one about connections, to other people and how much they mean to you, and how far you're willing to go for them. It shows determination and loyalty, and love. This show has the story of two brothers and the hardships their relationship dealt with, and all of the hidden reasons behind their actions. This show and these characters made me understand the depth of brotherly, familial, and platonic love and how far it will take you. 
I have fallen in love with this world created in Naruto Shippuden and its wonderful stories, even the fillers I loved all of them. I will miss each and every one of them so much, and I'm so happy I got to experience it all. Overall, the main thing I learned from this show is Bonds and love. The bonds between Naruto and Sasuke, and between their friends. The bond between Sasuke and Itachi and how much they always loved each other. Many moments had me crying like a baby, losing characters I love, and just watching Naruto do many different things. Finally seeing him get married and become an adult made me so happy.
Please, watch this show. Maybe it's not for you, but, for me, it was a life-changing watch and I will always miss this world and its many characters.",10
"
                this show was average at best, half the show was filler and the other half was just meh for the most part. i felt that my enjoyment for the show peaked at the pain arc, but then after that it was just me finishing the show because i was already halfway through and i figured i might as well finish the show. 500 episodes of a meh anime, i no watch again :) but in all seriousness i did enjoy a fair bit of the show, mainly the first half and remember that this is just my opinion so if you liked it, that just
                  means you found something good in this show that i did not and i hope you did cause otherwise thats 500 episodes down the drain",3
"
                Careful Spoilers
It is very hard for me to rate this show because ass many many people in the world I liked a lot the pre-Pain death show, but after that the show and the manga is pure crap, the war is way too long and way too boring, and the flashbacks.... don't get me started with the flashbacks, they are annooying even in the manga. Dear Masashi Kishimoto it could be way better if instead of soo many boring af flashbacks you created a spin-off precuel with all the flashbacks. The show goes badly towards the end because the final boss if f*** Madara, please
                  men let the dead characters rest, the worst of it is that the resurrected characters are key to the story, and this is just awful.
The second part of the show is bad because the Sasuke comeback is forced af. This would be better ending with Nagato's death, the rest is again just pure crap",6
"
                this show is just overhyped, it went from talking about ninjas, to talking about how the main character can completely change a character personality just from talking. I still can't find the why to all of the 10/10 reviews when it doesn't even come close to that: the story degenerates and it quickly switches focus on fighting, the art is pretty decent you can't complain much about it, some characters receive less than 15 minutes of screentime and the series itself is 2/3 filler and most of the filler itself is just boring. what can i say, just another overhyped series.

"
                I'm not one for long lengthily reviews, so I'll be brief. The complexity of the storyline weaved in Naruto Shippuden is a great advancement in depth and seriousness. A change reflective of the growth in the characters as well as the viewing audience. Darker, more extensive backstories are revealed with many a plot twist in addition to breath-taking advancements from the prequel. Once you begin watching this (assuming you've watched and enjoyed the first) you'll be engrossed. The only reason I wouldn't score the anime perfectly would be due to the frequency of less interesting fillers in the middle of arcs as well as the
                  slow start before the real intensity and emotional depth takes hold in the plot.",9
"
                Naruto is a classic anime people should watch. Everyone will enjoy and be drawn to this. The storyline is very interesting (although it might have some fillers). The main protagonist is someone I can relate to. He never gives up, he draws people to him, be them friend or foe, and can kick butt in so many ways. His rival Sasuke can be a bit annoying, but he does have some redeeming qualities. Sakura can be unbearable at times but gets better during the last stages. Naruto is one character that kids can watch and even look up to. He can be a good role
                  model for kids everywhere.",10
"
                Disclaimer: My review is purely based on the cannon episodes of Shippuden. I did not watch the filler.
Naruto Shippuden is a very emotional character-driven story, and that's why I love it. Sure, it has an out-of-this-world story, with some pretty insane powers (though I do think that this is part of the anime's charm), but it's mainly the characters that carry the show. They are some of the most memorable, well-designed, iconic, and interesting characters in anime history if you ask me. 
Shippuden is also great from a technical standpoint. My mind is blown at how consistently fantastic, beautiful, and effective the music is. The
                  soundtrack has its own personality, and never fails in setting the mood for any given scene. The OPs and most of the EDs are also pretty unforgettable. While Shippuden certainly has many instances of subpar animation and art, there are also many instances of absolutely phenomenal art and fight choreography that are well worth the wait.
My only real issue is with one of the last arcs of the anime. I won't get into spoilers, but I thought it was, hands-down, the worst written cannon arc in all of Shippuden. This fact made the victory of that arc feel less deserved and a little hollow. That being said, the anime does end on a beautiful high note. As a whole, this anime is profoundly memorable. Because of that, I can forgive the aforementioned poorly written arc. This was a wonderful anime, and deciding to watch it from the beginning was one of the best decisions I've ever made.",9
"
                Both series of Naruto were in my opinion unenjoyable, at its worst the anime is inconsistent with animation, plethora of poorly written characters and poor pacing with things like 6 mins of recap footage, cutaways to backstories and flashbacks not necessary to whats going on, and actual interesting characters in the original series that I liked ended up becoming background characters being replaced for even worse written characters. With the 700 episodes of Naruto you could better spend ur time watching 30 smaller 12 episode anime. At its best Naruto is full of unique design, amazing fight scenes and creative fighting styles and techniques, and
                  interesting character dynamics developing one of the most iconic rivalries in anime history. Although I did not take the time to watch all 700 episodes I would not recommend anyone this anime",2
"
                Apart from the war arc and ending this is a great anime. Unfortunately the series ended up being milked at the end for money. Masashi Kishimoto's brother Seishi's o-parts hunter also had a war arc but it was done a lot better than what's in naruto. Yes the war arc has some exciting moments but it lacked a distinct purpose (and there are other parts that have you scratching your head wondering ""does that make sense""). It's pretty disappointing that kishi dropped the ball on the end because i think naruto could have continued developing characters. The fights going from more hand to hand to
                  dragon ball level attacks didn't feel natural",9
"
                Naruto Shippuden, in my opinion, is one of the best animes I watched here is why.
First of lost character development from every character in the series.
The art was perfect in my opinion it could have been a bit better but I still think the art was great.
The sound was one of the best parts the endings and openings were amazing no disappointment at all.
The story and plot were both amazing and I didn't even mind the fillers but the flashbacks were annoying which is one of the naruto weaknesses.
My personal favorite was the pain arc but the war arc was a bit dragged but it
                  ended up being worth it at the end.
Overall 10/10 Amazing anime.",10

                King of retcons. Queen of killing continuity. I thought this was some hype shit; at least for a shonen. But my dumbass was like 10 at the time and looking back it was mediocre at best and I don’t understand how people older than me can see it as otherwise. When the series first started, the show was about strategy and mastery of stealth, jutsu, and planning. Now what? Who can explode more shit? Who has the biggest ghost monster. A betrayal of nostalgia. If you want to watch/read a shonen, go read One Piece (don’t watch pacing is shit). 2/10.

                Here we have a world that holds quite an immersive story which not only advances over time, but even events of the world's past end up building up the events that took place in the story's present era.
As for the characters (ignoring filler characters) we saw a lot of them grow up over time (especially due to the use of the time skip) as well as see just how corrupting a tale of revenge can be. Though of course we'll always have our complaints on some things ('Useless' Sakura and Sasuke only paying an arm for his actions), but they don't really do much damage
                  to the series overall.
So great series overall...but the only real downside in my opinion would be the sheer amount of fillers in this and its predecessor (Naruto). Such is the fate of the 2000s era mainstream anime.",9
"
                I will waste no time here to layout the story, you all should already know it by the time you get to this review. So instead I'll answer the elephant in the room questions about this series; ""IS IT WORTH THE TIME TO WATCH A SERIES THIS LONG? IS THE FILLER THAT BAD?"" The first answer is yes with a but. Yes it's good, and when it’s at it's best, it’s great! BUT, when it's not good it's past bad to downright insulting. I understand recaps are for those who may be joining the adventure late, but the series does it so often that it
                  negates what comes before. So is it worth the watch, yes, but be prepared to skip some episodes like I did. 
The second question’s answer is yes, with a maybe. Yes it is. I mentioned I skipped chunks of this series, maybe if you love the series and/or characters you'll find motivation to watch the filler. The show has a large cast with a wide array of characters, some you’ll like more than others. That may be more motivation to watch the filler arcs than I had. I watched some of it, but not all. The six out of ten stems from the fact that when the show is at it’s best it’s a ten, and when it’s at it’s worst it’s a 1 average those together it’s 5.5. It’s just entertaining enough to round up to a six.",6
"
                I'll try to keep this short:
If you skip most of the fillers (not all), the anime is pretty good. 
It's one of those animes that grow on you over time, and it's all worth it when you watch the final episodes as if you went on the journey with Naruto, watched him grow from a nobody to one of the strongest people to exist in the universe.
The music is really good and well used. It never changes from the original and it's used perfectly.
Naruto has the best Anime plot I've ever watched.
There are many characters and you will definitely find one to relate too. Most
                  of the female characters are hard to like and some don't get enough screentime.
If you're willing to take the journey, I assure you you won't regret it.",10
"
                The best anime after naruto is naruto shippuden. Yes as it tells u about betrayals like who  betrayed konohagakure no sato (Hidden leaf village) it also shows about itachi and sasuke(i am not giving spoilers) it gives the secrets as if u know in the prequel naruto and doesn't know his parents. It even shows about gaara and naruto which i like absolutely. So i give it a full 100/100. It even shows things which are nice. The only thing i dont like is why did the makers make naruto almost bald in later episodes he dosent look nice. I would prefer his hairstyle
                  like minato which looks so much nice and if he would get uzumaki strength with namizaki also if would be nice. So bye",10
"
                After the original Naruto series the quality of the story diminishes greatly. Mostly because Naruto's popularity made the corporate control over the series much more involved, thus skewing the story to fit polling, and also the narrative got really convoluted just in terms of enemies and power ups and this and that. I'd still recommend watching this just because some parts of the story are worth knowing! If you've seen the og Naruto, seeing Naruto pursue Sasuke, and Sasuke's bid for power and search for the truth are something you want to see unravel. Lot's of really cool fights in this series. Can get really
                  monotonous though, especially if you watch fillers. Not to spoil anything, but if you are excited for character development, expect to see the opposite in some cases, you will probably be disappointed if you are really looking into the show. If not, then enjoy it for what it is!",7
"
                Well, can't say I didn't enjoy such anime, but the plot was going on for too long with it's fair share of fillers happening. But the one in manga however, proves me wrong. The main point here is like one of those in the previous naruto seasons where the bloody epic battle between sasuke and naruto were totally outstanding.
 I think what kept this anime going is the sort of predicted events that are going to come from the main plot, but at the same time, some unexpected turn of events from the sidelines. overall, it's a worthwhile anime.

                I was so sad when I came to know that Naruto Shippuden has come to end but its great, all well when the ends well. They should have made some wedding scenes too but I think they must be working on the 'Boruto' series, after all its going to be aired on 5th of April. I hope to see some old characters in Boruto. It was disappointing that they haven't mention a single scene of Jiraya, he was the one teach Naruto the ""Ransengan"" and taught him about the ""Sage mode"".
Overall, the last episode made me cry like others too, I love the show and
                  hope Boruto bring back the old Naruto days.

                About Naruto: OMG this is one of the trash and overrated Anime I've ever seen. 
Plot? Cliche, cheap emotional scenes
What about Characters? They're suck, Kishimoto is a bad writer he literally can't draw women characters, no character development.
What about art? Inconsistent. Especially the Naruto vs Pain and I actually laughed at the Anime while the Anime isn't really emotional. 
What about Sound? Cheap and overrated soundtracks, I rather hear Yugioh soundtracks instead, Yugioh soundtracks although underrated but it's absolutely Better than Naruto soundtrack and can easily fit with other animes like God Anger, Battle of God,...
Tons of fillers and flashbacks. 
This isn't your shonen Anime.

                As much as i loved both naruto(Young and older) I'm just going to say that i enjoyed the fact, that i got to play the games reading the manga and watching the anime since they're all good they follow up the story ...not much to say really besides my disappointed reviews on some errors within this series. . .
>Sakura not dying. . . .
>Neji's death wasn't really needed,
>Boruto still ninja or Advanced Technology..?
I would agree not all animes could normally get in my feelings but this anime gave characters actual hearts which connected and was able to hit mine indeed i was in a hurry
                  to wipe years off my face when naruto was talking to his father(edo form) about telling him he was doing well and to give the message to his mother but if you all had this same feeling be sure to let me know.. i'm sure you too could use a shoulder~ :P",10
"
                Naruto fans need to calm down. 
This show needs 80 episodes MAXIMUM. 
The long awaited ending was completely BAD.
If you have time to watch this UNNECESSARY LONG SHOW, skip the fillers and most episodes and you will still feel bored a bit.
Every 50-100 episodes you will feel some kind of excitement, and then, LOOK AT THAT, MORE FILLERS.
I was completely hyped for this show, myself and from other people, and I expected so much from it, but it is a really poor and long show all in all. 
Tastes are different, but there is no need to waste time on such an anime (where most
                  episodes aren't even connected to the manga itself).",5

                Story: 9
I really love the story, and -spoiler- the storyline gets exponentially more complicated and I really like that. The mediocre 'me = best ninja and my friend ran away, I must get him back' changed to some masterminds with mindf*ck plans that actually make sense! If you're a kid, you won't get what happened after the first arc with Sai.
Art: 1
It's not exactly the art, it's the animation. It's like they don't care if the animation is any good. They slagged off with the starting of shippuden and I really can't give a higher grade than an 1
Sound: 5
It had some great OP and
                  ED's, especially bacchoi!! I really like most of the voices. Some of them are anoying, like sakura, but in general it's quite good.
Character: 6
I dislike a lot of them. A lot of them are just annoying, like sakura, but there are some characters who are just epic wins! I would like to praise Itachi, Deidara, Jiraiya, Pain, Shikamaru, Hinata and Kiba.
Enjoyment: 7
Despite the lack of good animation and annoying voices and characters, this anime has a lot of great jokes and some characters just make you laugh, no matter what. 
Overall: 7
I would give it 8 if the animation was ANY good",7
"
                How in the world can people claim this to be the greatest anime they've seen? *Deep sigh*
This show had 40 episodes worth of content and like 20 good episodes and even in those good episodes there was like 8 minutes of content.
The art was super inconsistent, you clearly saw when the studio ran out of money and started drawing like little children.
There was no Character development.
It was overall a dreadful experience and it wasn't enjoyable at all.
People hyped this show to be life altering and the greatest thing a man can see.
If you ever want to start this show, I'd suggest rather hitting your head
                  through the wall and then going skinny dipping at the fountain in the middle of your city. getting arrested for that offers more enjoyment than any of the episodes in this show.",4
"
                QUICK REVIEW, MINOR SPOILERS.
so.. I finally watched Naruto, dubbed as one of the three great big shounen, and I have so many mixed feelings about it.. so let's start!
Story 7/10: the story... was not one of its strongest points. It's good, but does it drag on unnecessarily with plot Twists that make no sense at times? 100%. A prime example of this is orochimaru switching sides randomly and with no real explanation  other than 'the wind'. This is a character who's literally committed genocide. That said, I do think the mangaka does an insanely well done job with highlighting certain themes from beginning to
                  end, such as perseverance and friendship. The repetitiveness of the constant love/hate  between sasuke/naruto, the idea of the 3 in a team representing history & idea of hate and love itself throughout history is what truly brought forward emotions for myself and really carried the plot. That said, pain arc was a masterpiece, and all the other arcs in shippuden pale in comparison. Furthermore, it concluded the huge series really nicely with the wedding... makes me wonder if boruto was needed...
Art 4/10: disgusting, and the reason is in this section im including the outright bad fillers and flashbacks. Okay  some fillers mightve been good , but when you're in the middle of a war and suddenly have a filler of happy konohamaru..no, just no. People use the excuse of 'were binge watching it now but at the time fillers were good' - let me tell you, no they weren't. Why? Because one piece has less fillers than naruto, running since 1997+ and being double the length . There's other ways to go around lengthening/ delaying the show, and having 20 episode arc long fillers in the middle of scene is a no no. And the flashbacks... you get flashbacks from the episode before. I truly wonder how much better naruto would've been without the fillers and unnecessary flashbacks.
Sound 9/10: beautiful, the themes that play during a certain group, truly resonates their character. Openings and endings were solid. No complaints at all.
Character 10/10: This is what carried the show. This. When you talk to someone about naruto, they don't say I wanna be naruto, the say I wanna be madara,  or itachi  or daedara. The villains were so well designed and have so much personality it truly is what made naruto into a masterpiece in my opinion. Naruto didn't carry the show, the villains did. The character development was top notch, seeing narutos growth throughout the entire anime was really solid to watch as well, same with sasuke. Even sakura to a certain extent. Also special shootout to kakashi, easily one of the most liked characters in the entire show,  tbh all the characters were above average with design. Then there's the most significant characters,  naruto and sasuke. The love/hate between them is so beautiful and eloquent, that it draws out a multitude of emotions from the watcher, who's awaiting them to meet. I've never seen such love portrayed as the way naruto did for sasuke in any anime really.
Enjoyment 8/10: Naruto is truly unique. It's an anime I can see why so many people admire it. But let's be honest here, if the villains weren't as cool as they are , I don't think it would've been a show to remember.",7
"
                Most of us will probably review Naruto base on nostalgic more then logic. I too remember when I first saw Naruto, because it was one of the earlier anime I watched and being a ninja was the coolest thing. You can do all these hand signs and focus your chakra and the most random running style ever. But looking back at Naruto, those were long gone once Shippuuden hits. Basically toss all that out the door, world building and power scaling, what's that? 
Remember how Madara name sent chill down everyone's back and how a whole war started just because of that name alone. Well
                  guess what, he's just a pawn and who the heck is Kaguya? Where is the setup.. oh we'll explain some plot that it's all been there without really building up to it and you'll just have to accept it. 
I can go on and complain a lot about Naruto, because I loved Naruto when it first came out. Well until we got fillers and talking Ninjutsu. Honestly I was never a fan of Naruto lol... since I thought he was the most trash Ninja... Since in my head, a ninja is crafty and silent, Naruto is like totally everything opposite. He had his moments in the earlier arc... but I got annoyed by him more and more as it went on. 
The power scaling is just dumb as ever too... remember how they said Naruto can't use that one technique a lot... then he goes only spam it the rest of the time... yeah... when power scaling was a thing. Good times good times... 
Well no point of commenting or messaging me, I don't really care if you want to defend Naruto or whatever. I once too loved it, but I ain't looking back at it with nostalgic eyes, because if I did, I would say I loved it... but upon watching more anime, I remember why I couldn't finish it. 
But hey I will admit, Guy vs Madara was probably one of the coolest fight scene in Shippuuden... seriously though, I love him but he should've died. And wtf is up with Neji death seriously? I didn't feel sad, more like that's just poor writing.",3
"
                Story:(8) The need to get stronger continues from where Naruto was in the hostipal asking Jaraiya to personally train him to save a friend (Original Naruto). 2 years and a half have passed when he returns to Konoha. The need to save a friend is it worth?, or forget about this rogue ninja?. The decision is on Naruto throughout the story. Pain Arc (-1) a resurrection is so wasted when characters already displayed their feelings of ones death. War Arc (-1) this one is contentiously adding fillers when you know the content of fillers since it was already explained this was a nuisance when you
                  make it from this nuisance you will enjoy it later on. (Personal Opinion) The new Naruto generation is not interesting to me, and it should of ended with Shippuden after Naruto ,and Sasuke last fight at the Valley. That episode of it's epilogue is where it truly ends for me.
Art(7) The continuously consistently not up to par animation is so frequent during this anime (-2). It really disappointed me since the (Original Naruto) have better animation this is embarrassing. (-1)
Sound(9) The soundtrack is worthy for the ear to listen, and for the fitting right moments it makes sense to have it there to add excitement, or personal moments. It's original counterpart had a better list to continuously use throughout the anime while Shippuden have less. (-1)
Character(10) Character build up is prevalent in the time skip, and it questioned you how much they changed since the skip. Once more they are enjoyable characters compared to its original counterpart.
Enjoyment(8) From these ratings it leaves me with a 7 pushing to a 8 since the characters are so worth the wait to watch build up in their character development.
Overall(7)",7
"
                One of the most popular animes of all time..
Writing seems to have gotten better than its original series. The episodes where they showcase the past were probably the best episodes in the whole series other than the fights. The story was good but had bad pacing at times especially during the fights, some flaws, and also the sub par stories of some of the episodes because almost half of them were fillers. Character development was good also. The characters were alright, there are very few that are likable or interesting.
Some of the openings and endings of this anime are legendary and are definitely in the
                  anime hall of fame. The music was amazing. Animation looked pretty good but quite inconsistent at times. It had a similar vibe to the previous series.
Overall it was an enjoyable series, it was well rounded and the only thing that really sticked out was the lore and history of this fictional world.
Memorable: No.. Rewatchable: Maybe..",7
"
                Alguns personagens não foram de todo muito bem aproveitados, senti falta de um aprofundamento na história dos outros jinchuurikis. As outras vilas também não foram muito bem aproveitadas, acho que o universo da névoa, da nuvem e da pedra poderiam entrar mais cedo no enredo. 
Em algumas partes as novels passam a ser melhores que o canon original... 
O final do anime também não me agradou tanto, creio que o autor tinha de fato um grande desafio ao tentar explicar a origem dos poderes oculares e dos bijuus, mas ele poderia ter feito melhor.
A minha nota se justifica por gostar do canon até saga Pain

"
                Naruto Shippuden : The first 300 episodes are clearly nothing compaired to the rest. The last 200 are what made Naruto so good, they are the reason why everyone love Naruto. The sound, the animation, the story, everything is awesome. But there is one thing that bothers me. The ending. It could've been 1000 times better... In my opinion, it should have stopped when Sasuke and Naruto are lying on the ground after the final fight. After that, everything feels like non canon episode. All the hype was gone, and Naruto didn't even become the hokage. Also, the art and animation was batched. Other than
                  that, I am glad that I watched this anime, it really affected me.",8
"
                I have watched Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden as a child and loved the action, now that I am older an have been watching anime for many many years (17) out of the hundreds of shonen anime, Naruto takes the first place prize! you can watch Naruto simply for the action, but you can dig much much deeper into the characters past and see their development, as well as see the wonderful meaning behind the story, the depth of some characters truly amazes me, and the mystery is not lacking either! You truly feel like your there experiencing these characters emotions as well as the story first hand!
                  This is a great first anime especially! I cannot tell you how many people have gone from hating anime to loving it because I recommended Naruto series to them. I consider my self a seasoned veteran when it comes to shonen anime, and I am pretty picky about what I consider 10/10, but Naruto hits the ball out of the park!! Even the 3rd time I watched the series all the way through, there was STILL things that I did not even think about and mystery to uncover. IF you have not watched Naruto I suggest you do, stick with it and really look at the whole show (depth, story, characters, plot, theme) or just stick around for the fights, up to you either way you will not be disappointed! The last thing I will leave you with is, if you really do not like filler, skip the Naruto fillers and go back and watch them at a later time. A  lot of them are really funny, JUST MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACTUALLY FILLER! some episodes are cannon/filler mix!",10
"
                This series was a disaster. Right from the start I was already annoyed when Naruto was screaming SASUKE but I never realized that would basically sum up the Story of Shippuden. The series started getting dull because of the characters, the animation and the story also, I'm not saying that this series didn't have AWESOME moments but unfortunately, there are more bad moments than good ones. The few Naruto fans that I know, told me that they stopped watching Shippuden out of frustration and honestly I don't blame them BUT by the end, the show redeems itself and I would say that aside from the
                  little flaws that annoy me, the end is pretty satisfying.  
If you watched Naruto, you have to watch Shippuden in order to get some closure so my advice is avoid the filler and prepare to be surprised and for a few disappointing moments.",5
"
                I actually grew up with Naruto. I was around eight and use to wait for him to come on adult swim. Enough corny backstory let`s get into Naruto: Shippuuden. I really like this show. The fact that he was able to beat all odds when the world wanted to see him fail or to become mediocre its a good lesson for people of all ages. Not only that every episode had a lesson attached to it. 
OK Let`s get into the cons. Those D*MN filler episodes towards the end. I don`t know if he was trying to continue this anime like the infinite tsukuyomi or
                  what. I understand the creators need to stretch out this legendary and famous anime but come on dude. Also the graphic animation of fights of the last few seasons of the anime were a bit ..odd? Like you couldnt see legs or their faces were contorted so weirdly lol. Maybe they were trying to stress the magnitude of power each character held? I don`t know but it was funny looking. The anime finished when both Naruto and I was seventeen and I was in SHAMBLES. I cried for one minute.",10
"
                Before I start, yes Naruto was one of my first anime and I did grow up with it and I may be blinded by its nostalgia by just a tiny bit. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible by talking about what I liked and what I didn't like in this show.
I'll start by saying that Naruto has one of the best cast of characters from any Shonen anime I've seen. You can say whatever you want about Naruto's story and all the plot holes and inconsistencies it has, but you can't deny Kishimoto's character writing for the most part is amazing. There's a
                  reason why these characters are so iconic and why many other writers have taken inspiration from them. There are so many characters I love in this show, but there are just too many of them so I just gonna talk about my top favorite ones.
Naruto is one of my favorite shonen protagonists. I love the way he's written and how he first appears in the story. We first see him as this annoying brat that likes to make a mess of things, but then we learn about his past and what happened to his parents. We also learn that the nine tails is sealed inside of him and that's the reason why the village treats him like an outcast. So obviously Naruto dreams to be Hokage so he can be acknowledged by everyone in the village and seeing him grow as a person and as a character throughout the OG show and Shippuden is really satisfying. What I also like about him is his personality, he's always being really goofy but he isn't stupid, during a dire situation he knows that he must get serious and fight like a man. I don't really have much more to say about him, while he isn't my favorite character in this show, he's still amazing and while people like to meme the whole Sasuke and Naruto thing, I actually thought it was a good dynamic between the two.
Now I'm gonna talk about my favorite character in this whole series and who is also one of my favorites of all time, and that is Itachi. Itachi is probably one of the most well-written characters from any shonen series. After learning his entire backstory and his motivations, he instantly became my favorite character, his past is one of the best parts of this show and he stole the moment in pretty much every scene he was in. I think I said this in my Bleach review for Ichimaru, but I really love characters that hide their true motivations from the audience and then later reveal what they really were. Itachi alongside Ulquiorra 100% deserves to be part of the black air force round table.
Now I'll talk about Kakashi who is my second favorite character and is also one of the most fun badass characters in this entire show. I just love seeing tragic characters hiding their dark past and emotions behind their fun personalities. His Anbu backstory is one of the best arcs in Shippuden. Although It's filler I would say It's one of the most well-written arcs in this show because it really dives into his depressing past and what his life was like after losing Rin and Obito. Also, I would say It's pretty obvious that a lot of writers have taken inspiration from Kakashi's character. You can deny it as much as you want but come on now, you easily can tell that Gojo was influenced by Kakashi. I'm not throwing shade at Gojo or anything but his design, personality, power, status, are very similar. I mean come on just look at the two. I think If there was a Shonen Jump crossover these two would get along quite well.
Lastly, I'll keep this brief but Naruto probably has one of the best and most iconic villains in all of anime. Just like Aizen if you search up the top ten best anime villains, nine times out of then you'll see a Naruto villain there. Pain is one of the most badass drippy characters in this entire show, his whole character, every scene he's in, and his entire cycle of hatred speech is just so awesome and well written. In fact, the entire Akatsuki was badass. Madara probably had one of the most badass introductions in a Shonen anime. He fights an entire army as a warm-up match and later continues trash-talking, he's was honestly one of the better parts of the Fourth Great Ninja War arc until he was ruined by the ending but I'll talk more about in the things I didn't like.
There are so many other things I love in Naruto that I haven't mentioned yet, mainly because I don't want to make this review too long, so I'll just put it all here. The ost is amazing. The Pain arc is one of my favorite arcs of all time. Other characters I loved in this show are, Gaara, Rock Lee, Neji, Guy, Jiraya, Hinata, Orochimaru, Obito (for the most part), Minato, Shikamaru, and Shisui although I'm sure I'm forgetting a few of them. The animation is also really good, granted some of the animation can get choppy but when it wants to get good, it gets good. Naruto's fights at the time were like nothing else, no other Shonen series could even compete against it. Granted a lot of newer anime have better animation but honestly prefer the old fully hand-drawn animation. 
Just like Bleach my biggest issue with this show is THE F%#KING FILLER AND THE EXTREME PADDING THAT STUDIO PIERROT HAD DONE! But this time my experience was much worse because unlike Bleach where I actually skipped all the filler, I was watching Naruto as it was airing so I wouldn't know when a filler episode would come crashing down from hell. The filler was atrocious because you would watch a canon episode, and then you would get hit by filler non-stop. You had to wait for so many months just to watch a canon episode only to get hit by garbage filler again. This was one of the many reasons why the Fourth-Great-Ninja-War arc is considered the worst (apart from a few dumb story decisions). Because this was the time when the fillers wouldn't stop coming. Another thing myself and many people hate are the female characters in this show. Kishimoto doesn't know how to write female characters because most of them are so forgettable. Sakura is considered one of the worst characters in Shonen history, if you take her out of the story, it changes essentially nothing. Honestly, if you take most of the female characters out of Naruto, it changes nothing. Granted that doesn't mean that all the female characters are bad. I really like Hinata, and Tsunade and Anko are pretty decent, but for the most the female characters suck. Another major issue was Madara's defeat and the introduction of Kaguya. Her introduction and backstory alone created more plot holes than anything else in Naruto. Kishimoto literally admitted that he made Madara too powerful and that he didn't know how to kill him off, so he shoe-horned Kaguya an even more overpowered villain into the story. Another thing that I didn't like was that a lot of the supporting characters from OG Naruto got side-lined in Shippuden, granted they have their moments here and there, but for the most part, they didn't really do anything.
Naruto is one of my favorite anime of all time, it isn't my actual favorite or anything because of all these issues that I had, but It's still really good. If I'm being fair and unbiased, I would still think that this is the best shonen anime I've seen. My score for this would probably be an 8.6/10 or an 8.7/10. But I'm putting my nostalgic biased glasses on and I'm giving it a 9/10. Also just like Bleach, be wary of the toxic ass fans, because Naruto has one of the most annoying fandoms out there, although the toxicity has gone down by a lot. Another thing I hate aren't the fans or anything in the anime, It's the people who haven't watched it, for some reason people will bash on you if you like Naruto even if they haven't watched it. I cannot tell you how many times people have said this to me on site, It's one of the most annoying this ever. Anyway, Naruto is really good, stop hating on it for the dumbest reasons and go watch it.",9

                  outside forces posing a threat to the entire Hidden Leaf village, Naruto discovers that he must become much stronger if he ever wants to realize his dream and protect the friendships he's forged .
This series is long but if you start watching it you won't quit. First some episodes is boring but later it becomes interesting . You can skip fillers .There are total 720 Episodes and Some Movies . Movies are kind of fillers , you can skip . But I prefer you to watch Naruto Shippuden : Road to Ninja . The characters of this series are amazing . The music of this series are amazing .
Every anime lover should watch it . It shows us true friendship and love . It shows how the life is without parents .",9

                I finished Naruto on Saturday 4/2/2022 1:02AM, but I couldn't comment, so I am writing my review now.
Naruto is my favorite anime and there is no other to compare it to. I still didn't gave it a 10/10, because it was a bit spoiled for my by Tiktok and other social medias (but not a lot, just that there will be wedding at the end of the series, that Itachi will die, about Rin too), it also had a lot of filler, but all of the fillers build up some kind of relationship with every character, so I was able to feel at least a
                  bit of pain (compared to the actual characters) in every death, a bit joy, laughter and other emotions.
For me the saddest episode was 474 (Congratulations), because Naruto lost his father again (R.I.P.) and the whole talk to Minato was just depressing and I was crying like a baby that night.
The death that hit me the most was Jiraiya's (my favorite side character). It didn't hit me when He died, but the episodes where Naruto found out about it killed me inside and the flashbacks to memories of him.
Not a lot to say about this show, because it left me speechless, but I need to give a shout out time my man Itachi for being a hero we didn't deserve....
Best villains:
1.Itachi (not a real villain, but everybody in the anime thinks like that, so ye...)
2.Pain or Nagato (He wanted true peace, but in the wrong way)
3.Obito (a strong shinobi and I give him my respect for what he has done. All He really wanted was a world with Rin in it)
4.Madara (the God of the shinobi, but all he wanted was power and that was the thing that killed him)
5.Orochimaru (at the end He became a good guy, but he still killed the 3rd Hokage)
That pretty much sums up my review. Could be writing about the whole show, but even this was a drag to write (I'm kind of like Shikamaru :D ).
Want to say hi to my cousin who started watching Naruto 3 years ago. When I started watching it he was about 100-200 episodes away from the end, but I still caught up to him and surpassed (He is about 50 episodes away from the end of it, but can't really be watching, because He is studying hard in the university). Don't really know if he is using this site, but he still is the guy who got me into anime, so i really appreciate that.
I will most definitely will be re-watching this in like a year or a bit more.
Thanks to the staff for creating this masterpiece <3

                Look, this show was pretty great, and is a dang classic. Love the setting, themes, and everything about it! As a weekly series though, the filler is absolutely a detriment.
I'd give this a 8-9 star if you could cut all the flashbacks from it. It gets to a point where you will watch a scene, a flashback will play of that scene, and then they will talk about it for 5 minutes mid- battle before flashing back to the talk they just had. It doesn't respect your time and I almost dropped the show because I was so put off by this. Quantity over quality
                  was very much a theme for about half of Shippuden.
If you're willing to follow a list of the ""cannon"" happenings and forego context of the episodes, that might be your fastest route through Shippuden. I got through most of these 500 eps by CONSTANTLY hitting 'forward 10s' on my media player, and found that 60-80% of each episode didn't have any new content, just rehashing. This will literally happen, up to and in the final episode.
Good show. Filler makes me afraid to watch Boruto.",8
"
                500 episodes ------- 7.9 / 10
Hailed as a classic, hated as never before: Naruto Shippuden. It clearly suffers from its overuse of fillers. Even so, it still maintains an interesting narrative bringing action, comedy and drama together until its conclusion. Definitely a classic that has affected world culture and will continue to affect it over the years. Watching after the hype I must say: It is a decent and very fun anime.
The good:
-It has a good world building.
-well developed in terms of characters.
- Animation doesn't bother so much.
- Good sound design and soundtrack.The bad:
-  Fillers kill the pacing, especially at the final arc.
- Animation mistakes happen often.
-  Sound is worse than in comparasion with the classic version
Overvall a fun show to watch after the hype.",8
"
                Hmmm what can I say about Naruto?
Well, for having a total of 500 epsidoes 204 of these are fillers (This is 41% of the anime).  This is a bit annoying because it did drag out some of the scenes, which I found a bit unnecessary.  I think filler episodes break up the flow of the anime and makes me confused about what's happening when they finally end and go back to the main story.  
However, the anime was really fun to watch.  The anime had the right amount of comedy and angst when needed.  
Overall, the anime displayed good character
                  development (for some of the characters at least), I just wished that it had less filler episodes, but it's to be expected with an anime this big.",7
"
                Shippuden is literal fillers to the characters past. But incase you're skipping all the fillers,it's an enjoyable series. Plenty of likeable characters even though Naruto is still cringy to watch :/. I remember so many of the OP's in Naruto because it's just that good. The character development is tolerable,I suppose. The story feels rather slow at times,but it's alright for a shonen anime. In my personal opinion,the Pain arc is the best. Nothing can top that. The action is nice but not that amazing. Naruto:Shippuden is an alright anime at it's core but it can be enjoyable if you're into this kind of stuff.
                  Just don't go expecting great character development or an amazing story cause this anime doesn't have it.",7
"
                Oh boy, this is going to be a long one. I put Naruto Shippuden on Hiatus way back when in 2012 or so, when I caught up to the manga. At that time, Bee was first being introduced as a new character. 8 or so years later, I finally, over the stretch of a month, finally finished the entire show. There will be some spoilers in this review. It's been like 7 years since this show has been released, so I highly doubt you haven't watched this show, or plan on doing so anytime soon.
In all honesty, Naruto: Shippuuden can be said to contain many
                  flaws, some including ridiculous plot armor, plot holes, and questionable character development. Let's go over them. When talking about the plot in Naruto, one also has to include characters. Characters become a major plot point in many of the most important arcs in Naruto, and so they have to be discussed side by side. And what else but starting with the Main Character himself, Uzumaki Naruto? 
Naruto can't be considered a terrible shounen main character, and he certainly fills the role quite well. The problem is that much of his character could have been developed in a much greater way than what actually ended up ensuing in his self reflecting and confrontational arcs. His  beginning arcs were probably one of the best I've ever seen in a show: gradually transforming from a loner to an identity as a member of team seven. Iruka was the first person to acknowledge Naruto, and this gradual dynamic between Sasuke and Naruto begin to begin. Naruto is able to get acknowledgement and satisfaction from the bonds that he painstakingly forms, and Sasuke doesn't even want to form them in the first place, and thus begins the whole entire setup for their rivalry down the path. However, somewhere along the line, Naruto begins to stagnate as a character. He's extremely immature throughout the entire show, and despite this childish nature, still manages to mature in different ways. This is confusing to say the least. When it comes to his goals, which he eventually finds out with his interactions with Jiraiya and Pain, he's able to easily find his determination and objectives. which of course, can be summed up in: peace. Yet, at the same time, he's idealistic and lacks any sort of concrete plan that allows him to follow up on that objective, and this continues until the very end of the series, where he still has this immature idealistic world view. Neji's death might have been a wake up call for himself, and in some ways, it is. He realizes that in conflict, not everyone can be saved, yet he shouldn't wallow in that despairing emotion, but make sure that the ideals that the person died for wasn't for naught. Perhaps Itachi's talk about how not every burden can be shouldered on his own could also suffice as a rare form of maturing. However, this is where his maturation as a character seems to end, and these moments are few and far between, not to mention, extremely short. There are so many characters and story arcs that focus on Naruto persevering and reinforcing his determination for his goal, but there seems to an extreme lack in any sort of maturing or learning of how he's able to complete such a task. 
Instead of learning from his own mistakes, he instead gets convenient plot armor in the form of who knows what all scattered throughout the entire series, and this makes him bypass any sort of realization that his actions have consequences. Over and over again, you see Naruto charging into battle, determined to follow through his ideals, and stubborn enough to not ever budge. This is alright, but in the end, he gets beat up, but bailed out by whatever plot devices the author wants to throw at him. Maybe, if someone got extremely hurt, someone died for his mistakes, this would have been a key to his character development. Neji's death occurred in the rare moments that Naruto's actions were completely logical and were not made in a hot blooded attempt to stop the enemy. There is no arc where he undergoes the consequences of his actions, nor is there any arc that helps him understand the reality of his dream. What exactly is it that he can do to make hate disappear from the world? This self searching arc never began. I think it would have been immensely helpful to the depth of Naruto if there was just a single arc where he sees how conflict happens and faces the reality that there isn't just a single ""good"" side and ""bad"" side. Naruto obviously understands this theme very well, but it was always through the flashbacks of other people that he watches as a bystander, and never as a personal experience, and as a result, he never truly matures as a character as intended. The fourth ninja war could have been a great example of this happening, if not for the fact that that entire arc was pretty dumb. It clearly marks the shinobi world as ""the good guys"" and Madara and his gang, ""the bad guys."" Is it really a shinobi war if it's essentially Madara versus the entire world? It's ridiculous how such a great potential arc became a ""good"" vs ""bad"" guy arc. If there was a split in nations supporting and going against Madara, this could not only have been a great way to express how conflict isn't always black and white, but also great fights. Instead, we see lame fights between reanimated people, rather than real ones with real motivations. There is such a distinction that the author wants to make that ""these guys are bad and mind controlled by jutsu"" that it was hard to sit through. In fact, instead of having people side with Madara, in the end, everyone that used to support him goes against him, truly making it so that there is as little need for any distinction between good and bad at all. The entire war arc feels like a ""side character"" arc and doesn't feel like there was any sort of real engagement or conflict of interests in place, since again, everyone on the enemy side was mind controlled or copies of Zetsu.
Sasuke, on the other hand, manages to be a much better character in this aspect. Broiled in revenge, he kills his older brother, only to find out the undertones and plots that are hidden in the village. He sets his eyes on the sole reason why Itachi had to kill his own clan: the clan itself. However hot blooded revenge is stopped short by meeting with his brother once again through edo tensei. This arc of revenge to redemption is a clear turning point in Sasuke's character, and is the reason why his goals go from a revenger to a desire to be a savior. This decision to become a savior was also only after he came face to face with the previous hokage, which again, further reinforce the fact that not everything is light and dark. He also cements his perfect idea of what it is to achieve his goal as a savior.
What Naruto and Sasuke both have in common are their idealistic hot blooded pursuits in their goals, yet Sasuke manages to comprehend, through his self reflection, on how to achieve his goals, however silly they might have been. And despite the fact that  there is such a focus on Naruto's character the entire series, there fails to be any sort of progression as a character in Naruto for the most part, only reinforcing his idealistic dreams, while Sasuke is able to become a more well rounded character with much less screen time and focus. In the end, Naruto's and Sasuke's goals are both idealisitc, but Sasuke matures more as a character, and even determines his next course of action without much difficulty, while Naruto is merely led along the plot of ""defeating the bad guys"" for essentially, the entire series. This does make Naruto progress as a character, but stops short of actually trying to make his abstract goals tangible through his own way of thinking.
Plot armor is also a pretty big issue for Naruto, but it is such for all shounen series in general, but the more pressing issue is power progression. Naruto is considered to be a pretty untalented person, yet he still manages to become the strongest shinobi in the world. How did that happen? Power progression in Naruto Shippuuden is one of the most inconsistent things. People get crazy powers throughout the entire show, and not only is this method fast and instantaneous, it also happens so often. There are so many times in the show where a huge fight is tilting greatly in one side's favor, but due to a crazy powerup reversal, the other side has a great advantage. Both the ""good side"" and ""bad side"" do this constantly near the end of the arcs. Not only is this pretty stupid, it doesn't make a lot of sense plot wise. There were many times where some people were so overpowering the other side that the fight was declared over, yet somehow, they don't finish them off and allow them to power up. This power progression is also reserved for a select few, so essentially Sasuke and Naruto become the only relevant characters, power wise at the end of the story. This brings more consequences other than poor plot. It completely destroys and semblance of need for any side characters, and this is my biggest problem with the series.
Naruto has one of the best cast of characters in the entire series. Lee, Tenten, Gaara, Neji, Guy, Iruka, Ino, etc etc. There are definitely quite a cast of arcs dedicated to a lot of side characters in Naruto, and it is one of the best points in Naruto. These characters have great personalities and contributed to the plot greatly, earlier in the story, yet fade to obscurity as the story goes on, and when Sasuke and Naruto become overpowering and leave everyone behind to the point where they don't become any sort of meaningful support. Arcs without Naruto in it tend to be pretty damn good. My favorite arc in Shippuuden was definitely Shikamaru and Asuma's arc. The fights were great, Shikamaru's development was great, and the enemy was interesting to watch. In the end, it goes to show that it was definitely possible for there to be a lot more potential arcs concerning the rest of the cast of characters, but it was never explored, but rather just wasted on Naruto. Fights were flashy for sure, but when the same message of ""wow you're just like me, I was lonely and sad too,"" and ""bad guys are bad, I want peace"" gets repeated over and over again, you wonder what could have happened if these characters got more love. Not only are characters shoved aside because power level wise, they were completely obsolete, but it also got rid of any sort of interesting fights involving ninjutsu. Shikamaru's arc, again, is an excellent example of this. His shadow binding jutsu was used in unique and different ways, and so were the enemy's jutsu as well. He couldn't afford to get injured because the enemy was able to reflect injuries right back at you. There was a lot of strategy and matchups that were used, but in later fights, this doesn't happen. It's just more like ""I'm going to bash you in with my OP power, you don't stand a chance,"" and for the most part, this is basically what happens. No unique techniques get introduced, no interesting strategies, but just straight up broken and OP powers get brute forced into defeating the enemy. Elemental weaknesses and strengths essentially don't get mentioned ever again at some point. It really sucks. Power creep in Naruto not only demolish characters, but it also got rid of the interesting ninjutsu's that people were employing in fights. This is most apparent in one single ability: Edo tensei. A completely busted and overpowered ability that has so much impact on the ninja war, yet apparently becomes super weak in the later arcs. What happened to invincibility? What happened to unlimited chakra? Edo tensei manages to become one the most busted jutsu's in the show, but becomes practically useless by the end of it, and it also highlights the lack of consistency. Edo tensei not only becomes obsolete because of power creep, but more importantly, it actually gets weaker for no reason at all. It goes from an invincible form  that can't be stopped other than sealing. Regardless of element type, sage chakra, or OP abilities, they will regenerate. Regardless of how much chakra is used, they can regenerate. These features become disabled right after the ninja war arc, and it's never explained. What a bunch of bull.
I talk about characters in Naruto as if there were no bad ones. Far from the truth. Sakura and Kuruma are the worst characters, by far, in the series. I always knew the meme about Sakura being useless was a thing, but I thought it was an exaggeration , if anything. It really wasn't. Sakura is a piece of emotional baggage that had literally no influence on the plot other than the fact that Naruto liked her. Liked. her. It was pretty clear that Naruto liked Sakura in the beginning of the series, but as time went on, Naruto accepted that Sakura didn't have the eyes for him, and Naruto even matures so great that he calls her out on his fake confession. This shows how much as a character Naruto grew in this department at the very least. If this were in the beginning, Naruto would have accepted it no doubt. Sakura, on the other hand, can't make up her mind. Time and time again, she can't make her own decisions, and it's clear that her only role in the series is to make us pissed at her. She can't make a decision on Sasuke. Or on killing Obito. or on her resolve to fight. She is such a static character, as she never truly progresses or matures throughout the entire series, and is babied the entire way by all the people around her, especially Naruto. She too, suffers from power creep immensely, and never manages to catch up to, even after her line of ""I've caught up to them, Tsunade"" quote. What a joke. She's unironically also a simp. Loves Sasuke from beginning to the end, despite Sasuke only berating her, trying to kill her, and not making a bond with her to the end. Even after all the crap Sasuke does to her, she is irrevocably in love with him. Holy. Crap. Naruto moves on with his love eventually, yet Sakura manages to never do such a thing. Without reason, no matter what Sasuke does, Sakura loves him anyway. She didn't do a single thing for Sasuke, in the end either. As Sasuke said, the only bond he had was with Naruto, not Sakura. Naruto was his only friend. Naruto is the one that Sasuke acknowledges, not Sakura. Overall, not an impactful character. She hogs a bunch of screentime only because she was on team seven in the past with Naruto and Sasuke. 
Kuruma's definitely a much better character than Sakura, but he's still a pretty bad one. He just randomly transitions from an amalgamation of evil to ""good guy"" within the span of a few minutes in a single episode. I think we all knew that Naruto was going to bond with Kuruma and that Kuruma was going to eventually befriend Naruto, but what a lame and anticlimatic bonding that was! Sure, there were many arcs regarding the evil nature and uncooperativeness of Kuruma, and the his tug of war with Naruto, but there really wasn't much of a bonding arc, and this was much needed. In the end, he gets defeated by Naruto, and acknowledges him as a result. You might be thinking that Sasuke's bonding with Naruto was essentially the same thing, but Sasuke wasn't actually ""defeated"" by Naruto physically, but philosophically. and this gets explained a lot more. Kuruma's arc felt like subdued=good guy. Not only was it short, it didn't make a lot of sense.
That concludes the main points I wanted to share. There was a lot more to cover, but these were the major points that I wanted to cover.
Side note: I had the benefit of being able to watch both the anime and read the manga long after the series had ended, and as a result, I was able to navigate any and all fillers by combining my reading through any chapters that were mixed/filler, and skipped all the episodes that were filler. As a result, I had the unadulterated canon viewing experience, and in my opinion, the best way to experience the show. I can't say I would have enjoyed the series as much if I didn't have this opportunity, and can't blame other people for disliking the show because they had to sit through all the filler content. But hear me out. I get it, the filler is bad, but unlike one piece's way of introducing filler, in Naruto, pacing is still alright. There's just filler in the form of entire filler arcs and flashbacks. This can easily be skipped. One piece's filler was ""unskippable."" The show was just at a constant snails pace, which led me to adopt only the manga as a result. Given I could skip the filler, I still rate the anime decently, comparable to the manga.",7

There is like 500 épisodes, and you can easily remake the entiere anime 99times better in like, what, 4,5 seasons ? There is no more story , 4 or 5 seasons, the entiere remainder is filler.

                anyone would know this anime. This anime already has many fans in the world. the Naruto Shippuden series is a continuation of Little Naruto. Many changes appear in Naruto Shippuden, namely improved graphics, storylines that turn out to be more exciting, new jutsu jutsu that appear, and the appearance of Akatsuki that makes the story more interesting and exciting. In Naruto Shippuden there are also many epic moments and exciting and exciting battles. character building is also getting stronger, especially the main character, Uzumaki Naruto. In this anime, the role of Uchiha Sasuke is also getting cooler and more epic. the added value of Naruto
                  Shippuden is the backsound of each scene is very appropriate to the moment, especially sad scenes, very touching. moreover, plus an exciting fight with a long duration is very interesting to watch. the biggest shortcoming of this anime is too many FILLERS. again the filler problem occurs again in the anime Naruto Shippuden, after the previous series there were also many fillers. many fillers are not important in Naruto Shippuden. but there are also interesting filler episodes that still connect to the main story. I know the filler is made so that the anime is not overtaken by the manga. Now Naruto Shippuden has finished, and filler is not too much of a problem. Naruto Shippuden is finished with the happy ending story. Naruto is married to Hinata, and life becomes peaceful.
Naruto is my favorite action anime and will not be replaced by other anime, because this anime has become a legend for me. especially Naruto Shippuden whose storyline changes dramatically, becoming more exciting. I am a big fan of Naruto anime and Naruto Shippuden anime, and also Boruto anime. maybe if Naruto Shippuden has a little filler, then this anime rating will definitely be high, even in my opinion it can be up to 9, because this anime is very popular in the world and has many fans, and has a very exciting story.",9
"
                Maybe my review is too positive about Naruto because it was thanks to him that I started to watch anime and have the passion for Japanese works as I have today so for me, despite the flaws (which are not few) Naruto is easily in the my top 3 favorite anime. As it's been a while since I saw the anime, maybe I'm not specifying and detailing a lot since I don't remember everything.
   Of the defects that I remember the most striking are the fillers, animation and script holes. Starting with the fillers, the bad part: for those who followed the time
                  when the episodes were released weekly, you know how frustrating it was for you to wait a whole week to see the anime's plot unfold and I found myself a noda filler in the middle of the fight telling things random; the good part: there were some very but very funny fillers man, as an example there is that filler that shows the dream of someone who is in tsukuyomi and in Kankuro's dream it is him controlling a giant robot lol.
   The animation: good most of the time it is average to good however in the arc of the 4th ninja war it was shit after shit in terms of animation as an example has the scene of Obito turning around after absorbing the Juubi (that was horrible) . I didn't mention the Pain VS Naruto fight because I think it was a stroke style done that way on purpose, like in the Gaara VS Rock Lee fight in the classic. I would like to mention some parts that the animation surpassed itself: Kakashi VS Obito inside Kamui, Madara VS Guy with the 8 gates and Naruto VS Sasuke in the valley of the end (there are several others but then I would spend all day talking about that).
 Now comes the worst part of the entire anime, the plot holes, starting with the questions that no one knows how to answer, how did Hashirama die? How did Minato master dead Kurama's cloak? Why didn't Hiruzen raise Naruto as a son? Why didn't Jiraiya come back even once in 10 years to help Naruto? Well, these are questions that we will probably never know the answer to, maybe in Boruto we can get an answer but for now we don't have anything.
   Ah, I wanted to talk about Naruto's charisma, I sincerely wish I had a friend like him, the guy just puts you up in conversation brother, besides we follow all his evolution both physically and emotionally, it's like I saw a son succeeding in life. Naruto really inspired my life even if the characters are not real and I know the work is far from perfect but it is definitely the work that marked my life and that's why it will always be in my heart.
   This is my humble review about Naruto, I didn't cover all the points that a review should have, I just talked about the points I'm interested in. 
Portuguese Version:
   Talvez a minha review seja positiva demais sobre Naruto pois foi graças a ele que eu comecei a ver animes e ter a paixão por obras japonesas como eu tenho hoje por isso para mim, apesar dos defeitos (que não são poucos) Naruto é está facilmente no meu top 3 animes favoritos. Como já faz tempo que vi o anime talvez eu não esteja especificando e detalhando muito já que não me recordo de tudo.
Dos defeitos que eu me lembro os mais marcantes são os fillers, a animação e os furos de roteiro. Começando com os fillers, a parte ruim: para quem acompanhou na época que lançava os episódios semanalmente sabe o quão frustrante era você esperar uma semana inteira para ver o desenrolar da trama do anime e me vim um filler do noda no meio da luta contando coisas aleatórias; a parte boa: tinha uns fillers muito mas muito engraçados cara, como exemplo tem aquele filler que o mostra o sonho de quem ta no tsukuyomi e no sonho do Kankuro é ele controlando um robô gigante kkkkkkk.
   A animação: bom em sua maior parte do tempo ela é mediana para boa entretanto no arco da 4º guerra ninja foi cagada átras de cagada em quesito de animação como exemplo tem a cena do Obito se virando depois de absorver a Juubi (aquilo foi horrível). Não citei a luta do Pain VS Naruto pois eu acho que foi um estilo de traço feito daquele jeito de proposito, como na luta do Gaara VS Rock Lee no clássico. Gostaria de citar algumas partes que a animação se superou: Kakashi VS Obito dentro do Kamui, Madara VS Guy com os 8 portões e Naruto VS Sasuke no vale do fim (tem varias outras mas ai eu ia passar o dia todo falando só disso).
Agora vem a pior parte de de todo o anime, os furos de roteiro, começando com as perguntas que ninguém sabe responder, como Hashirama morreu? Como que o Minato dominou o manto da Kurama morto? Porque o Hiruzen não criou o Naruto como filho? Porque o Jiraiya não voltou uma vez sequer em 10 anos para ajudar o Naruto? Bom, essas são perguntas que provavelmente nunca saberemos a resposta, talvez em Boruto a gente consigo alguma resposta mas por enquanto não temos nada.
   Ah, eu queria falar sobre o carisma do Naruto, eu sinceramente queria ter um amigo como ele, o cara te poem para cima só na conversa irmão, além de a gente acompanhar toda a evolução dele tanto física como emocional, é como se eu visse um filho tendo sucesso na vida. Naruto realmente inspirou minha vida mesmo que os personagens não sejam reais e eu sei que a obra ta longe de ser perfeita mas definitivamente é a obra que marcou a minha vida e por isso ela sempre vai estar em meu coração.
   Esta é a minha humilde review sobre Naruto, não abordei todos os pontos que uma review deveria ter, apenas falei dos pontos aos quais eu me interesso.",9

                - TALKING ABOUT BOTH SERIES - NARUTO AND SHIPPUDEN
When you first look at this you think wow, this is very long. Nah, over 70% of it are fillers and just don't matter. 
Beside the absurd amount of fillers, the plot is pretty amazing, even though character development doesn't actually happen until half way between shippuden and doesn't happen at all in the original series. So basically you have to wait 700 episodes for Sakura to be less annoying, Sasuke to be less useless and a character who is 'there' to make Naruto's adventure somewhat meaningful. At least Kakashi stayed the best character throughout and wasn't
                  killed off like most of the other few great characters.
It may sound like I'm talking bad about this, but I really did love it even though a lot of the time it was frustrating to watch.",8
"
                Shippuuden  (non filler) 
Story 9: pretty solid story I'd say but didn't get the end goal. Naruto did not become hakage(training to be one). Great story of friendships and working as a team. Growing together. 
Art 9: great art during fights, some of the animation is not the best in the background (character wise) never the least animation is great for it's time. 
Sound 8: few OP stuck with me, none of the ED stuck with me. Dub cast was on point too, I liked that some of the characters had different VA as time went on since they were getting older. 
Character 8:
                  great character development, almost all characters from Naruto played a big role in Shippuuden. I didn't end up liking Sasuke(I really don't see why people like him). If itachi didn't exist Sasuke would of been the worse character IMO.
Enjoyment 9: honestly fights scenes are incredible and the characters you meet you will fall in love with. 
Total: 8.6",8
"
                I liked Naruto Shippuden a lot because (for the first half of the show) the plot was great but in the second half of the show the plot was kinda all over the place with lots of battles here and there.
Sure, it’s good that there’s a lot of action in it because that is what it’s meant to be like but half of the fights are filled with flashbacks which makes them last way longer than they should.
Do I think this is better than the original Naruto? Kinda. Some arcs of the show are just plain bad because sometimes you don't even know whats going
                  on in the fight.
The show does a good job censoring things like blood by making the person being hurt into just a black silhouette.
There is WAY TOO MUCH filler in this show. 45% of it is filler so it may seem there’s 500 episodes but if you’re watching without filler you only get to watch about 300. Also (I can’t confirm this considering I haven’t watched the filler) the filler is absolute dog poop.
The show has some good characters with interesting backstory and I think you’ll have a fun time learning about the characters.
This show is also a (mostly) family friendly show with not very much gore, blood or violence.",8
"
                Naruto is a tricky one for me. I absolutely adore the manga, I'm still reading it and I was really excited when I heard that the Naruto Shippuden was coming! The first 30-40 episodes were alright...not great, but they weren't terrible. After that, there were just too many fillers, strayed quite a bit from the manga and I just dropped it. Also, I believe the anime just kind of got cheesy and the art wasn't as great either. So, overall, I give Naruto Shippuden a 8/10 because of the manga. The art is great, story is great, no fillers...but the Naruto Shippuden anime just gave
                  Naruto a bad name in my opinion. My recommendation: if you want to start reading Naruto or gave up on it, don't watch the anime! Read the manga, you won't be disappointed :) .",8
"
                The Anime lost ratings on a couple of things overall is a 6 because of the listed reasons. 
1. Dubb taking way too long, even series that came out a year ago are getting dubbed first.  Rating loss 1.0
2. The Flashbacks had me constantly saying ""That's not what you said"" Seriously one scene could have been pulled from episode 2 but they decided to screw it up instead. Rating loss 2.0
3. Just constantly aggravating me with breaking away from the war arc. rating loss 1.0
Now don't get me wrong some fillers were well placed and worked perfectly like Kakashis childhood fillers. HOWEVER as cool
                  as it was to see the second chunin exams it should have been SAVED for AFTER the war arc.",6
"
                Anime was great srls 10/10 + i grown up with it... kinda nostalgic.. just one BIG -
Everyone know why. If not, let me tell you.. FILLERS.. 
Yet, still love this anime and those who wanent seen it yet. Its in a must watch list. 
Story great, art great, sound great, character great like we get a lot info about characters. 
Story is not that copy/paste isekai nowdays too. Even now idk any good anime as naruto with ninjas.
 Page wants longer review so i have to say something else.. hmm..
Thx for reading i guess? :D
Or something like that. Hope you find this short review usefull.
                  Still cant subit god deatmit.. Should i write book ion there or something?",10
"
                THIS IS JUST THE BEST ANIME FOR ME
I have never ever cried so much on any other anime. Even the most unnesscary(sorry for the spell) flashbacks can make you cry from villain to villain no matter how much irritating they. They are unique in their own way
My favourite is obviously Kakashi Itachi and Gaara!!
Not also that naruto teaches us a lot of important things, like never ever give up on your dreams, do not leave your friends and who are dear to you alone. There are lots more
Also the greatest 4th ninja war is awesome. If you havent watched this you should. You will regret
                  later if you dont watch this
Anyways a very great anime!!!!",10
"
                ""Naruto Shippuuden"" gets me nostalgic AF. It's the one anime that you can't stop thinking about for weeks after completion.The story and the plot is pretty awesome. Action scenes were also nice. Sometimes the animation sucked, but the story took care of it. For example, the pain arc .It has some plot holes, like deidora could use self explosion repeatedly in edo form. But the only thing that keeps me away from rating it a 10 is its ""FILLERS"". The first impression of 500 episodes scares the shit out of people .Still, overall it is a pretty decent one .I would highly recommend anyone who
                  has patience and guts to watch it. And skip the fillers if you want. You won't miss anything by doing so.",9
"
                I keep my reviews short, simple, and to the point for those of you who don’t want to read the rest of these essays. If you liked Naruto, you will like naruto shippuden, it is absolutely worth your time. Do not watch shippuden unless you have already seen the 2002 naruto. This is a continuation of naruto. The fights are hype, the new villains are awesome, and there’s a huge improvement in characters. The world is expanded on even further, the story picks up and is fast paced. The powers get even cooler. We are blessed with some awesome  music/openings. It gets surprisingly emotional
                  at times, which you would not expect of this show. There are some must see fight scenes with legendary animation and build up. It has a problem with too many repetitive flashbacks, but you can skip through them so it isn’t unbearable. It sets up nicely for Boruto, which is the next continuation, while leaving you with a satisfying and conclusive end even if you are never to watch boruto. There are filler episodes like in the 2002 naruto and as I said in that review you can skip them and not miss out on the story, however if you have the time I would still go ahead and check them out if you are a fan. You can also just go back and watch them after you finish the main show. They are enjoyable and I do not regret sitting through them. If you are still hungry for more naruto after you finish, check out the movies.",9
"
                Again, I skipped the filler in this show.  Say what you want about the rating and the payoffs and the pitfalls but let me tell you guys this show made me cry (you all know what specific character death I'm talking about here) laugh, rage and everything in-between.  You come to care for character's you never thought you would more than you ever thought you would.  You're invested in their lives and in the plot and despite all it's flaws I can't help but say the hate is not deserved.  Shippuden is really great, even better than the original imo, and
                  you can come to your own conclusion upon finishing it (believe me I have qualms myself) but please do give it a try.",9
"
                After 1 week after the end of Naruto a new series Began named Naruto Shippuden, it s the sequel of the previous anime named Naruto, that takes place after 2 years of naruto training with Jirayia
The story is by far one of the best out there in the Anime World, that will make you cry several times, after you begin the series you can't stop watching episodes that's how good the story is, the story is good but the fillers make this more enjoyable.
The art stands by personal opinions but i think the art did a prety good job for me as i enjoyed the
                  art i'm gonna give it an 8.
Well the sound is on another level, only the songs make you cry, the songs feel alive and they make you fell the character entire story with them a very well maded songs that caracterizize the character well
i'll give it an 10
Well the Character are also pretty well designed that have an clear ambition, that they want to get stronger, to protect their friends,but they are pretty bad written characters too, one of the best character developments it s Itachi his story is far on another level, you had to cry at least 1 time when you heard his story.
Well i enjoyed the serries pretty much but he has too many fillers and i think the level could be reduced because they are like 40% of the series hope the kai version comes out.
I'll give it an 8
Overall Naruto Shippuden gets an 9.",9
"
                honestly a 7 overall, but the reason I'm giving it an 8 is because of the way it ended. Ending shows is rly hard, and this one really stuck the landing. The final naruto and sasuke fight was perfect in terms of explaining their respective ideologies and how they clashed, and the way they reconciled was epic too. The actual fight itself was really nicely shown, and the symbolism and details throughout was top notch. The aftermath and the wedding was very nicely done as well, so props for that.
The middle of it though was really tough. From the end of the pain arc to
                  when Madara gets the ten tails, it felt really dull and monotonous honestly, except for some parts like the truth about Itachi. The early part of the war especially felt very boring and dull, the reanimations just didnt feel emotional when fighting, probably cos they weren't real, and that whole arc felt like a proper drag. If that middle part had honestly been cut in half, it would have made the whole thing way more enjoyable. I didnt even watch most of the filler episodes too, I can iamgine if I chose to do that, it would have turned out to be even more long and dull. 
Best advice to enjoy it, skip almost all fillers (search online for the few that are worth), and watch most of the war arc at x1.5 speed, cos its very repetitive and boring until Madara arises.",8
"
                Anime with the best ninja story concept ever. I watched Naruto anime since I was in junior high school. This anime is very popular in Indonesia. All anime lovers in Indonesia, must know about Naruto.
An anime about epic ninja fights, and entertaining ninja adventures, as well as a harsh ninja world.
An anime that tells about Uzumaki Natuto, who wants to become Hokage, and become a great ninja, who is relied on by many people.
This anime is good, but there are things I don't like. Too many non-canon filler stories, and too many flashbacks, which doesn't really matter.
              ",8
"
                I'd be hard pressed to admit that Naruto: Shippuuden was entirely bad, but amidst all the action and story and characters, there's something the show sorely had too much of: Filler. 500 episodes and almost half of it (a quick google search shows you that it's 202 episodes exactly) doesn't develop the story. I haven't finished the anime but I know the whole story as I had just played the video games, and they're much better at conveying the long overarching story of this ninja epic. It highlights a glaring problem for me and possible newcomers to the series, that half of what you're watching
                  doesn't actually matter. I've only seen the show up until the end of the Five Kage arc and I'd be lying if I said that all the filler was bad, but that doesn't excuse the 90% of bad filler. The show would probably be a solid 8 for me but filler, filler, filler brings it down to a measly 6. Just play the videogames if you can, they're much more fun :)",6
"
                I enjoyed watching this anime from the beginning when he was younger trying to prove himself and also when he came back as an adult. The only problem was that now the story seems like it is slowing down. It is taking them 2 months just to show 1 fight scene. Other than that I love this anime.
              ",8
"
                Naruto
1% action, 99% flashbacks
I love this anime and yet I hate the anime. It’s all about ninjas. The ideas are great but the story isn’t told well. 
So Naruto has a demon sealed inside him. A demon with nine tails, it’s one of nine tailed demons from the One Tail to the Nine Tails.
Because of this Naruto is hated by the villagers because this demon attacked their village a few years back. Naruto’s dream is to become leader of the village, the Hokage. This is the basic plot so far.
Now my main problem with this anime is that it’s suppose to be an action anime
                  but there isn’t that much action, just a bunch of talking, Naruto constantly makes a speech about how he wants to be Hokaga, Hokage, Hokage. When you think you’re gonna get a cool action sequence they interrupt it with a flashback. And they reuse the same flashbacks over and over and over…
It’s like Dragonball Z, now this is an anime that I love and hate. DBZ’s problem is that they’re always standing around staring at each other, charging their power, etc. But DBZ is better, better action, more interesting villains, etc.
You might enjoy this anime if you watch it online, but back then I didn’t have internet and was forced to watch 1 episode a week, so I didn’t have time to waste with flashbacks. 
Not much to say about Shippudden, Naruto hasn’t changed that much, he still uses the same techniques, the show got more serious but it’s still 1%action 99%flashbacks.
My favorite characters are Mito Guy and Rock Lee, these are I think the only two who actually use martial arts whereas everybody else is using ninjutsu and genjutsu (“magic” techniques)",7
"
                NARUTO SHIPPUDEN is the real deal but it also has its negative points.
For example: too many filler episodes(almost 50 percent of anime is made by filler and most of the filler episodes ain,t worth watching at all. Its just waste your life time.)
The anime is about the ninja world but its just showing too much hand sighs and trainings and it lacks some great fight scenes.
just like season one, there are too many filler characters with a nonesence backstory 
that really means nothing.
It could have so many great fights in it but naruto,s goddamn Talk no jutsu killed the mood.
So many great & important characters
                  got killed by kishimoto,s hands just to make naruto & sasuke the only reason to watch the anime or read the manga.
There are too many useless characters like Rock Lee,Sai or choji.
naruto & sasuke are just two ordinary shinobies that could defeat the gods with the power of friendship(NAKAMA POWER) and its really meaningless.
Defeating the immortal & highly trained Gods with only NAKAMA POWER? Give me a break.
and also, the plot armor is much more than it should be
on my opinion: READ THE MANGA
Even the Ending ain,t gonna worth it(watch the anime & you,ll get what i mean)
in fact, NARUTO is just the most overrated anime in shounen-jump series.
Its the one & only ninja anime that you can get.
That,s all.",7
"
                Naruto Shippuden is definitely one of those series where if you truly understand it, it becomes very memorable  whereas if you don't then you see it as mediocre.
in it's most basic form Naruto: Shippuden is a series where about a boy named Naruto who just wanted to fit in with people, become respected and acknowledged by everyone including his best friend and rival Uchiha Sasuke.  Naruto just represents the unacknowledged youth of today who are ignored by society and left all alone in to rot away.
now let's get down to my real review of Naruto: Shippuden
Naruto's story is fairly decent enough it doesn't
                  have the best writing of a Shonen anime but it's not bad either it's fairly good. many a times it's about how society can fck you up and make you purposeless that you start to hate society itself, but again this theme seems to be repetitive used amongst some of the major antagonists throughout the series, the plot seems fairly predictable but not as predictable as Mid Ball Z lol Shippuden also has some retcons which were never addressed by Masashi Kishimoto I won't point it out here cuz I don't wanna spoil anybody reading this review. but Naruto is definitely one of the best anime when it comes to plot-twists of the show but hpwever these twists can come off with 0 foreshadowing at all but that IMO does little to make the series look bad, Naruto has very deep real life philosophy and emphasis with characters like Itachi, Obito, Sasuke, Pain , Madara, Hashirama , Hagoromo and Naruto himself. these characters more or less have been through very tight circumstances and in each case they developed different ideologies which are very similar at the same time that they follow. these characters with do or die life situations seem to be  well written, when it comes to side characters who aren't villains or anti-heroes or dudes who didnt die a long time ago Naruto does fall short for example the females Naruto seriously are some of the most laglustre in popular the only who ones who even contribute a little are Sakura, Tsunade and Konan, and even then Sakura and Konan mostly serve as supportive beta females to their male counterparts while there is also Kaguya Otsutsuki who seems interesting as a character but the way she gets introduced is very unappealing oh I almost forgot to mention that Naruto:Shippuden also has one of  if not the worst written female character in anime Hinata Hyuga, a creep with no individuality who makes me sick just by appearing on screen like everytime she appears i feel like fast-forwarding. Naruto still has some good compelling side characters like Might Guy, Kakashi, Shikamaru, Choji and Sai.
Naruto definitely has Immaculate art and fight scenes, Naruto's fight scenes are one of the best in anime and it's mostly thanks to chakra for being a incredible power system throughout the series even from the days of the OG Naruto, Naruto fights such as Naruto vs Pain, Kakashi vs Obito, Might Guy vs Madara will always be remembered by Anime fans for generations to come, Baruti had very good comedy too especially with the adult jokes sprinkled in between.
when it comes to music Naruto: Shippuden has incredible masterpiece openings like Silhouette and Blue Bird and endings too, their music is so addicting that I think Naruto: Shippuden is the very reason why I stopped my habit of skipping the openings
Overall Naruto is a series that I would recommend if you have the time to go through an anime with 100s of episodes",8
"
                In my opinion, Shippūden surpasses the original Naruto in some ways. Both are amazing shows, so what you favor more is up to you. Whether you decide on that or not, it is undeniable that Naruto Shippuden is a very successful and strong follow up to Naruto. It further explores the depth of many characters old and new. My favorite thing about this show is how each antagonist hardly feels like a villain. I was touched by their philosophies and how each compared to Naruto, the classic “bring peace to the world” guy. My only complaints with the show were the dragging out of the
                  Great Ninja War. This show, for me, was a 10/10 until the War. It was a good arc, BUT I found myself struggling to get through it towards the end. All in all, Naruto Shippuden was a fun watch!",9
"
                A very reasonable title, cut with filler and flashbacks to the point of being barely watchable much of the time.  When in doubt, jump to a flashback.  If in doubt about a flashback, put a flashback in your flashback.  Are we at the climax of the series?  Better bump it up to 90% flashback content.  Can't remember what's going on because of all the flashbacks?  Better recap — with a flashback.
The producers of the Naruto Shippuden anime milked what I assume was a pretty good manga for easily three to four times its value by turning exceptionally bad hack
                  writers loose on the story between installments of the manga, and by... well, it's like that time...

That, and the Yota mini-arc.  Seriously, **** that guy.",6
"
                I hate the way the female characters are written and designed. Why should kunoichi, female NINJA who are ACTIVE and shit, wear HEELS (ahem Sakura and Konan)??? That shit hurts your feet, and in many places of the world (ahem Japan)  women are still forced to wear high heels because misogyny. And yet it is being glorified by this show.
Why won't any of the main female characters stop moaning and groaning about some man? The male characters never sacrifice so much of their time and energy for a woman. 
""But Kishimoto said he can't write women"" that's so fucking misogynistic. You write women
                  like you would write any other character. It's like you're saying you're bad at writing black people. Why treat us as some completely different species?
If you are going to treat women this way, then there is no point of having them as main characters and fighters in the first place, since they usually just get sidelined and protected by the men anyway.
For some reason i watched every single filler episode so my judgement of the actual story line is really clouded, but I loved the major fights and they made sense to me.
Spoilers ahead of this point!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sasuke's motivations however make no sense to me. Poorly written edgelord. Wanting to kill Konoha even though Itachi died for the sake of konoha. The only romantic relationship that made sense by the end of Shippuden was Temari and Shikamaru's. They had good chemistry.
Sasuke almost killing Sakura like 2 times and Sakura still pining for Sasuke for no other reason than him being attractive is terrible. Naruto still having a crush on Sakura for no reason and not having feelings for Hinata until the very end is shit writing. I mean, he even ignored her trying to cheer him up after Neji's death and her putting her hand on his face and them holding hands. And then he had the audacity to say to Minato ""yeah Sakura is my gf lol"" like bruh. Could've had him thinking after the fact ""hmmm Hinata is very nice, Sakura never treated me like that, I think I wanna go talk to her more."" But noooo. Instead he ignores her until the fucking shit movie that established their relationship.
Overall I just think the characters are poorly written and illogical.",5
"
                The story is absolutely beautiful. You have epic fights combined with deep emotions and unpredictable story changes that will blow your mind.
Marvelous. There are dozens of different characters and every one is unique. Even the side characters have distinguishable features, and the main characters show a character depth that many Hollywood movies could learn from nowadays.
Let's take the villain Orochimaru for example. He is easily the most well-designed antagonist I have seen in any motion picture, even in all the books I read I can't find a character like him. Pure evil. Cunning, bizarre, and frightening. On top of his unpredictable actions and twisted motives,
                  the music appearing together with him just rounds up the presentation of this character, and to me, makes it unforgettable.

"
                Naruto Shippuuden is a very well known mainstream fan favourite and continuation to Naruto with 185 filler episodes which aren't bad but y'know they're fillers and do what fillers do. The entire show is very entertaining including alot of the fillers giving you alot of time to have a connection to alot of the main characters, the story has alot of depth with what happens and what each character goes through with actual development so It's not just Naruto who develops. The show also wraps up very nicely although being a show with so many episodes you'll never have the perfect ending which is what
                  Boruto is for.
If you still haven't watched Naruto and are just looking at reviews for if you want to watch it or not I'd say it's a great mainstream anime to watch even with how many episodes it has which can look daunting but with the story it gives you it's definitely worth it.",10

                I watched naruto shippuden when I was 13 years old, so while I remember a lot of it I don't really remember enough to write a detailed review. It was ok. I skipped all the filler btw. 
**SPOILERS AHEAD.** Not major ones, but spoilers nonetheless.
Pain arc was definitely the highlight. Sakura was useless for nearly all 500 episodes. Itachi's story was really well written. The akatsuki were a well written group, and I really liked Madara. Not a fan of the Otsutsuki. A real asspull because the author couldn't figure out how Naruto and Sasuke could defeat Madara.

a masterpiece that makes you wonder the lives of characters other than the main characters and can be watched without skipping a second; and makes you feel like you grew up with the characters. and there's no nonsense that the main character must be strong; it's nice to explain character development as well. i watched it a bit late, but i'm glad i kept this anime for later. because at a time when i was in a void in my life, it was this anime that gave me morale again and kept me from thinking about my troubles; i

                Naruto is a series that a lot of people enjoy, my self-included at one point. That opinion changed however upon a second view of the series as a whole. While the many flaws that exist within this show could be repeated, they are ultimately mute as the real problems that exist in this show are most prevalent in it's story/character direction and its predictability. Naruto is a story that set itself up from the very beginning as a tale about a nobody coming from nothing and struggling to become the greatest so as to earn the respect and acknowledgement of his peers and those in
                  his community. It is a decent plot, one that has been unfortunately been beaten like a dead horse throughout shonen for the past several decades. As many know upon the completion of Shippuden however, that idea went out the window. Naruto is revealed to have been the reincarnation of the Christ analog of his universe as he and the rest of the main cast of heroes and villains are ushered into the levels of godhood that no other ninja regardless of effort could hope to replicate. Many state that this is where Naruto lost sight of its identity but I argue something more introspective. It never had one. Naruto has always had the Nine-Tails inside of him since episode one,  a mass of chakra with whom there are no contenders. Naruto uses the Nine-Tails to overcome every fight in the series in some way, shape, or form with one (arguably two) exceptions. Unfortunately, that isn't rising from nothing. That's taking the worlds greatest advantage and using it like a crutch instead of bettering yourself but then passing it off as of own efforts born of sweat, blood, and tears. If you took the Nine-Tails away from Naruto or created a situation where he couldn't bulldoze his way through a fight with virtually unlimited power, I can guarantee you that Naruto would lose and his opponent would be uninjured. All of his efforts only amount to him getting beat up on screen for ten minutes until he decides to end his fights with his signature technique, the Nine-Tails, or a combination of the two. You could watch all the fights that transpired with Naruto and 99.8 of them end this way. It gets to the point where fans of the series already know in the back of their mind how a fight is going to end before it even starts. Beyond that, the cast suffers from Bleach syndrome, in that the series has way too many side characters and jutsu and doesn't develop a majority of them beyond the surface level. The main cast is okay. I don't dislike Sakura and though she can be infuriating at times, I regard her as just another shonen woman who is doing her best to contribute to a series that primarily doesn't need her. I found Sasuke interesting, even for rival archetypes as his role is primarily undefined by Naruto which is good. Barring some moments where he acted out of character through the later half of the series, I was at least invested in his story. Kakashi is a great character with whom I probably never would have gotten through Naruto if he was not there. His role as the group mentor however was not the best as he is quickly abandoned by all three main characters midway through the series and is then out right replaced during a particular arc only to note upon his return that his students have surpassed him and don't need him anymore when they arguably have never needed him. The series also falls victim to key events that are ultimately made contrived to the point of insanity for the sake of preserving continuity and plot holes so gaping, I'm surprised they haven't imploded the series into several, conjoining black holes. I don't hate Naruto, as it is a series that does it's job in entertaining viewers (to an extent) but I can't help but feel as though it failed to tell the story it wanted to tell. Even part of the end goal is not even addressed until another (less popular) spin-off which cheapens the adventure that viewers invested their time in to see. While I would not recommend this series to anyone curious, I will not deter them from doing so as Naruto is an undeniably an experience but one that may leave you feeling disappointed and cheated.",3
"
                This series has disappointed me greatly in multiple ways, the main cases being how it destroys the core aspects of the series themes and how most of the loved side characters were handled poorly in execution and many established characters ended forgettable. There are other things such as the pacing being off in some arcs and inconsistent world building however, I would like to finish this review on a positive note and say that the actual production quality in regards to art and audio was generally done well.
In conclusion:
Shippuden hasn't succeeded in surpassing the original
Has glaring problems that are overlooked 
Is overall a 6/10",6
"
                ok so I've seen like 69+ series and I will have to say that this is most pathetic series. I watched up to shippuden 40. I am telling you nothing interesting happens, and like 90% of the series is filler anyway.
the plot is lacking and its excuse of a slice of life/action-drama type of show. I am posting this for people who haven't seen the show but the series is just NOT worth the acclaim or watching at all.
The characters are shite. The mc just so happens to get increasingly stronger enemies to fight along the way. than you have your emo broody guy who
                  all the fan girls swoon over while he talks about how much he resents his brother and must AVENGE HIS CLAN! get over it already and last you have your naturally talented good girl who has a crush on the bad boy, even though its obvious he hates her and that the other guy would kill to have her. It is waste of your days and you should watch something else instead. It will take over 3 and a half DAYS! you could have been doing something WAY more productive like watching one piece. PLEASE heed my words and never ever watch this series of overrated garbage!",1
"
                Okay this is going to be long so please bear with me. Prior to me many have written reviews on this so, you may not find many new points. So I will not write about separately about story, art etc instead I will try to provide my view objectively. Now coming to Naruto Shippuden, I believe it has received so much positivity majorly due to its nostalgia factor. It may not be as bad as I make it to be for some people but let me explain you in detail.
First let us discuss the main protagonists of the show:
The main problem I had with this
                  is the main trio. We can simply state them in three words ie, dumb,dumber,dumbest. Yes, they are so dumb. Naruto, the protagonist of the series never ever grows up. He is same as he was in Naruto(prequel) except for a few changes. And the people who used to dislike him come to like him for his same dumb antics. Even the characters who had rarely interacted with him believe in him and give *If its Naruto then it can be possible* vibes. They are the same people who hated him before.
The dumber part of the show goes to sakura. She is there to make us believe that she is equally strong and determined in the team #7. Her love(only if you can call it that) towards Sasuke is so unreasonable and forced. She is so clingy and is there just to make life of naruto difficult. She, like naruto never stops the ""sasuke sasuke"" thing which is annoying as hell. Kishimoto tries so hard to make us think she has become better. She has always been useless, only occasionally used to make us believe even she is strong. At other parts of the show ahe is just there to occupy space.
Now comes the dumbest part of the show. Yes, you guessed it right. It is none other than Sasuke. He is one of the main characters of the show but is absent for nearly half of the show. He gets ready to follow some stranger for the sake of power and ends up abandoning his comrades. To speak it was due to his jealousy towards naruto that made him to become strong. His motives are so messed up and they fluctuate tad bit too much to sympathize for his losses. Even till the end he is as hopeless as a person can get. I am trying to not spoil much but his sense of thinking is so messed up in the later part of the series.
This is not all, our main protagonist is so righteous that he goes on and on about friendship that he ends up putting all of his friends into risk in order to save one selfish, arrogant idiot. He gives so lengthy speeches to the antagonists that it makes me sick. He never stops ranting. He is just too loud and annoying for a protagonist. His attitude isn't any better as he does some pretty nonsensical shit during missions that would definitely make you question his maturity even after these many years. 
Yes, 2 years later, Naruto became 15 years old, and his personality is still the same. He is still unable to refrain from himself from doing something stupid that would fuck up his whole team. What irritates me are the techniques. For some reason, everything is an upgraded version of his previous techniques; Rasengan to Odama Rasengan to Rasenshuriken. 5 Clones to 100 Clones, then went to 1000 Clones.
Flashbacks are normal in many animes. However, Naruto is an exemption. The flashback last so long and most of the scenes are being repeated. Flashbacks in Naruto do not bear much significance in the story and yet I do not see the reason in dragging the flashbacks.
The fight scenes in this show are all talk and no battle. The fight scenes bores me to death. Fight scenes are very predictable. All characters spend most of their time just standing an telling lame stories rather than fighting. This is how the fights go- Naruto uses Kagebunshin. The enemy beats all of them, beats Naruto to pulp, then Naruto teaches the enemy about life and friendship and at last Naruto hits the enemy with a rasengan and the fight ends.
The backstories every antagonist is almost the same. Almost all were good but a single situation fucked up their lives and they end up on the bad side. This is not to say that there are no good characters. They are there but they take the back seat in the show.
It took Naruto heck lot of episodes to just get a single power up. There is nothing wrong with it but in the final few arcs he literally becomes god which makes all his hard work seem pointless.
The final arcs:
Ah! These are the worst part of the the show. It involves the great shinobi war which is dragged to death. It is very poorly written and the antagonist at the end of the show makes this show a joke. There is no build up for it. Yes it is the kaguya part. The war part almost makes naruto and his precious friend sasuke gods. They become gods to defeat gods and naruto is now even capable of healing. The final arcs make all the established rules and world building look stupid. Logic goes for a toss in most parts.
The good parts like a few arcs and characters are highly overshadowed by the terrible pacing, whole lot of filler and dumb main trio. The pacing is so terrible that there are so many pauses and others efforts put in to drag the show which make me feel nothing even after a bunch of episodes, as they cover very little progression. Don't even get me started on fillers. They just dragged the anime to make some 700 episodes which is not very enjoyable.
Finally there are good aspects which others mentioned so I chose not to as I feel they are so overshadowed by the fillers, pacing and the terrible main cast. I don't know how many people liked naruto but to me he seems too dumb and immature. So I mainly believe that this show rides on nostalgic factor. It has many notable inspirations taken from famous shonen series like HunterxHunter and Dragon Ball. 
In the end all I want to say that there are better shonen series like HunterxHunter and it is not worth the time you put into this series. Believe me when I say you won't miss a single part of story even if you watch it in 2x speed. By the way this is my first anime review. Anyway it doesn't really matter as I have rather made this review pretty late I guess.
I beg your pardon for any grammatical mistakes.
Thank you for your patience. Signing off...",5
"
                Ignoring the filler and focusing on the main story, it is a pretty decent anime. The writing on the villains was compelling but pretty much every moral struggle that any of them had was exactly the same, the talk no jutsu meme. The characters are generally interesting and likable but non of them have any character development. Most characters are exactly the same when the show ends as when the show starts, just with slightly more context. It quite literally takes to the last canon episode for Sasuke to stop being a douche, which is saying a lot. The fight choreography was really good for
                  important fights but lackluster for anything in between, so good on average. The show for me was a good gateway into anime but after rewatching it recently, I found that it isn't as good as I remembered and is definitely overhyped. I compare it to Star Wars where most of the content is mediocre but it creates a universe and deep lore that is very interesting and worth keeping up with.",5
"
                Naruto Shippuden is a legendary anime. It is old and it it brings back memories from the childhood. From the beginning i want to say that i only put 9 on overall because the enjoyment pull down the grade (i did put 6 because of fillers. 41% of the anime is with fillers). [this review may contain spoilers!!!]
1. STORY: The story is amazing. It is about a ninja that want to become the best one and he also wants to become the hokage (LEADER) of the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha). The story got many good things but the story is also sad sometimes (some character
                  die). From the beginning of series Narut, the main character is looking for his friend that left the village and join the Orochimaru team (Orochimaru is a villain). The story is most based on finding Sasuke (his lost friend). So i thing in the end the story is ok. Beginning and the End are so good
2. ART: The art it's very good because the Naruto shippuden was started in 2007 and in comparison with other anime the art and graphics are cool.
3. SOUND: The sound is amazing. It is so different from the others. It brings me old memories. 
4. Characters: The characters from this masterpiece are incredible. One of them i think are made in joke because are so useless in the anime but Naruto, Sasuke, Itachi, Obito, Kakashi, Madara, The 4th Hokake, etc. are so powerfull, good costumizated and got lot of good personality.
5. Enjoyment: The anime is very good but the fillers are so annoying because they are in the middle of a good fight or somthing light that. I am saying it again: there are 41% of the anime fillers.....
-----Overall----- The anime is great but the fillers are annoying. So the anime is 9/10 but i will give 10/10 because it brings me good memories of chilhood.",9
"
                just alil bit of spoilers !! praising my girl, sakura !! 
first of all shut the fuck up sakura is not useless , she saved naruto thousand of times, esp in that part where theyre about to go to orochumaru's hideout ,tsunade said that she only allow the team7 to go to partly bc sakura is part of it. in war arc where kurama were pulled out of naruto, sakura pumped naruto's heart with her bare heart!! in the first part of shippuden , sasori made a poison that took years to finished, and here is queen sakura that only need a day to make
                  an antidote. most of peeps who hate sakura is seven years old kid whos stuck in naruto og lol stay mad, oh and even in naruto og , sakura is weak but not useless, she protected naruto and sasuke in the chunin exam, if she did not, narusasu could had been in sound ninjas' hands . sakura have perfect chakra control even in naruto og, remember that climbing tree, amomg the three sakura was the first to do it. in pain arc yall stay dumb she did not summon naruto , the frog did it, in pain arc they were 16 or so, she was the one whos in charfe of konohas hospital bc shizune is busy, she had so many potential but sadly theyre misogynistic",9
"
                I have been sa watcher of Naruto for over three years now, and I must say, it has changed A LOT! Allow me to explain. 
Story:
The Story overall is kind of good. I like the whole original idea of Ninjas being the supreme beings in the world and like to kick each others asses just to show off their powerful swirling balls of air. In fact, sometimes it was SO original, that I couldn't even keep up with the huge cluster fuck of plot twists and new characters that were popping up in between canon and filler arcs. Since I made I to that part,
                  let's talk abouit the fillers. YAAAAAYYY! We all luv um. I lied, I hate them actually. And Naruto's fillers are SOO BAD that I, at one point, dropped the anime for a year, came back a year later, and they have only advanced 20 episodes of Canon. The gap between canon and filler is so small now. There is  new BORING filler arc every month. It is PATHETIC!!! 
Art:
The art for the anime was pretty good at the beginning of the series. The character design was complex and different, but as the series progressed, the art became lazier and lazier. Did you see the art for the Pein Arc? Holy Shit, what a fucking mess. And its only been worse from there. I'm scared that its going to turn into fucking Lucky Star five years from now. And we all know its going to last that long too, so shut up.
Sound:
All of the openings are also lazily done including the transitional music. They all sound the fucking same! The first Naruto series before Shippuden was pretty gifted in its music. Sadness and Sorrow was a really good song. One of my favorites, but it all went downhill from there.
Character:
There are s many characters, and surprisingly, I've managed to memorize all of their names. It's pretty amazing, . But seriously, thatsd the problem. Theres just too many. And the ones that are superfluous are just a waste of animation! They are fricking annoying and can't fight for themselves! All of his friends are pretty stupid. 
Enjoyment:
Meh
Overall:
6.5",6
"
                I will keep this short:
Manga 10/10
Games 10/10 (they are much better then even manga)
Anime 4/10
Once again the filler percentage is around 41% with ethe same problems as the Naruto Part 1 anime. Fillers don't give us nothing new to overall story, and exist only to overstretch the anime livespan. When anime adapts the story from the manga it's really perfect, but when the filler arrives it simply downgrades.I did even put a higher score because this show started to adapt some of light novels, but if you're watching this anime weekly it was impossible to tell the difference back then. For the manga it's really
                  a shonen classic at this point of time. The Storm games did even surpass the manga with the showcase of the final bosses fights (Naruto Shippuden opening 8 reference is the best example).",6
"
                This may be a hot take but I do not find Naruto to be a very well written character. He has no character growth throughout the show and you always know what he will do. It makes the show agonizingly predictable. Also many main cast characters such as Sakura are also very poorly written. Its also a shame because Naruto has some of the most well written characters in all of anime, but they are surprisingly under covered in the story. Secondly the show does a great job making a very interesting story between Sasuke and Naruto (although I think its a bit under-covered). Also
                  the story behind Itachi is truly a written masterpiece. Overall the main thing the story has going for it is that the writers did a great job of making lovable characters. You are hooked to the anime to see if the characters will succeed. And in the end they do. But now... yall know I was going to talk about this...
Fillers... Okay so... If I take away the fillers I would rate naruto probably a 8 or 9. But the sheer antagonizing fillers brings this show all the way to a 5. If you calculate. 47% of this entire show is filler. Let that sink it. Even if you have a filler guide, near the end the fillers all have some vital info so you need to watch SMH.",6
"
                There's a reason why Naruto Shippuden is at the mantle of the Big 3, and why it righteously holds a solid reputation.
When people regard Shippuden in a negative light the main point is typically filler, now obviously it's a fair complaint but easily avoidable and in some cases unavoidable for the animators. At least they made filler for those who enjoy it, opposed to not making anything at all.
In my opinion the peak of the anime was the pain arc, I have a hunch that Mishimoto had originally intended for the story to wrap up there but the franchise had just too much money potential.
                  
While the following arcs were great, I think that it almost dragged out the eventual ending of it and for someone to watch the series through, it could derive them from the original enjoyment and feelings that were conveyed. 
Overall, a great anime for anyone starting out. And even for those who want to develop a liking to the action genre as well.",8
"
                The classic and one of the most popular anime to exist. Actually bringing some newcomers to the anime world. And had many influences to the anime community and the internet itself. like who didnt knew Naruto is? Okay lets breakdown this in short paragraph.
The story in a whole is the continuation from the Naruto(kid) and the way how he achieve his goal for becoming Hokage and get acknowledged and respected by people in his village. And it the end it happen BUT hear me out, idk why they just made this story even more longer but for me Naruto Shippuden should've ended after Pain Arc.
                  The best arc in this franchise, with amazing buildup, story progression, and of course the aftermath. He lowkey achieve his goal by becoming the hero of the village and get loved by everyone. But why this story had to continue for another hundreds of eps? i mean there are still plenty good things come but if they decide to ended that story it would've be amazing. 
Then the war happened, may nostalgia feelings come through within almost every character because of the edo tensei thing that sometimes good but mostly boring with all of the FILLERS. Madara as a final boss is actually great too, too bad they made it even longer this tory by forcing the ""rebirth"" of Kaguya and thus Boruto could made his way on his new anime which is unnecesary.
Art itself is sometimes very good within those animation, but knowing that this is weekly animes that almost never stopped releasing every week. some downgrade in quality of animation is could be seen.
Sound? Pure joy to ears, OSTs and OP or ED is so amazingly done. its masterpiece.
Character? yeah some chararacters is fairly good and some just meh. And i still thinks final battle within Naruto and Sasuke is highly unnecessary after what they did to defeat Kaguya and Madara. They just threw all the development to the basket.
Enjoyment, for 500 eps there are like 300+ eps that are fillers, non-canon or boring things. had they removed those Naruto would still the same or maybe slightly better.
So thats why Naruto is 7/10 there are good things but many flaws are exist too.",7
"
                Naruto shippuuden could have been a really good anime, but, after a while in the anime they start using flashbacks, and not a few. 
Sometimes these flashbacks takes up 90% of a epsiode and the episode after shows even more flashbacks. 
Most of the flashbacks are not needed therefore they ruin the show.
The story it self is really good and is something that you can come a long way with, and they do they continue to put out new arcs that fits with the story.
It could have been great.
It could have been a really good anime.
But with all of these flashbacks it aint.

"
                I love the Naruto franchise... and Shippuden Just solidified that fact for me!!!
Naruto is a challenging exploration of themes such as the cycle of hatred, war, comradery, and peace. Through its expressive and varied cast of characters, it paints a vivid picture of the world in which they inhabit. This rich world is further brought to life by the gorgeous sound design and visuals. Shippuden truly is a sensory treat.
And I haven't even started on the characters. Kishimoto works best in creating memorable and fresh character dynamics that keep you drawn to the screen. In particular the dynamic between Naruto and Pain is a masterclass
                  in storytelling, not only being highly enjoyable, but also deeply tying into the show's themes...
...is what I would say if I were a CHUMP! Naruto sux!!
Haha just kidding, I meant what I said. Got you there kind moderator 😂
Thank you for reading my review.
Glopglup, signing off...",10
"
                This anime is by far my favorite, and I don't think there'll be anything that will surpass it. Though, I will admit it isn't overall perfect, but what anime is. All that matters that in my eyes I believe it to be the best and that's my opinion.
Story- 9/10
The story in Shippuden, while not extremely complex like some anime, it still contains underlying tones and messages in its arcs that make you think. It starts off immediately into an entertaining arc that once it starts the series never looks back. There wasn't an arc that I can say I didn't enjoy (excluding filler), some are
                  even my favorite arcs in all of anime, and while they mainly dealt with Naruto and Sasuke, the arcs also gave other characters development and growth that you don't see in a lot of series. The results of each arc are felt and have lasting effects on the characters and me as a viewer. Some arcs made me cry, some cheer, and some even caused me to reflect on life. Character deaths are meaningful and aren't something that are just brushed past, they are talked about and impact the series the rest of the show. The world is expanded upon and so is the lore that makes a somewhat smaller world larger and enhances it in the process. 
Art- 8.5/10
The animation in this show is its weakest point, but I wouldn't call it a negative. There are moments where you can see the flaws in certain scenes, where characters are making weird faces. Other than that the animation is good and the fight scenes are very well done with the visuals looking extremely good and the characters animated well. The fight scenes especially are amazing, with the attacks looking great, and the choreography of the fights can be among the best.
Sound- 10/10
The ost for Shippuden is among the best with emotional scenes being enhances by the background music, the fights feeling more intense because of it, and the comedic scenes better. So, the soundtrack does what it's supposed to do, enhances the overall anime. It is also, so good that I listen to a lot of them in my free time outside of watching the anime.
Characters- 10/10
Now we are on the strongest point of Shippuden, the cast of characters. Naruto and Sasuke are my favorite characters in anime, along with a couple of the supporting characters being in my top 20. Naruto and Sasuke are very well layered characters that change with what they experience around them, making them feel very human. Their bond is also something to love because they are the best pair of characters in anime, with how they interact with each other. Then, there's the supporting cast like; Kakashi, Shikamaru, Might Guy, Jiraiya, etc. Most get developed, some more than others, but it helps make you care more about these characters and what they go through in the story. Lastly there's the villains, which are also extremely strong characters, who have their own backstories and reasons for what they do. It makes you understand them, sympathize with them, and even agree with some of the points that they make. So, overall the characters are one of the major reasons that I enjoyed Shippuden. 
Enjoyment- 10/10
If you couldn't tell based off of what I wrote before this, I enjoy Shippuden to the fullest degree. Enough that I re-watched it twice and still got the same enjoyment out of it that I had the first time I watched it. 
Overall- 10/10 
So, overall I think that this is the best anime out there. Obviously this is my opinion and everyone has a right to their own. However, I request that you give it a chance if you haven't already, and I hope you get the same enjoyment out of it as I did.",10
"
                Naruto is a masterpiece buttttttttt jjba part seven steel ball run is ranked second so TAKE THAT NARUTO STANS.But if im being for real naruto is a masterpiece and in my opinion its a starting anime there are so many genres but naruto is just a average shounen jump normal power system and very well boring at times.Out of 500 episodes 210 are fillers thats 40 episodes away from being half FORTY.Almost half of naruto is just fillers and straight up boring.Comparing it to jjba is in my opinion pretty rude so I wont.Now that we got past the bad part the good parts well
                  its probably just the memorys and friends i made.Naruto was the first anime I have ever watched (other than pokemon) so it will always hold a place in my heart.",7
"
                strong points
+ best thing about naruto has got to be the characters. naruto, itachi, jiraiya, these are just some of the few examples of profoundly impactful characters that have etched a deep impression onto its viewers and caused viewers to be extremely emotionally attached to them and whatever they may experience throughout the story
+ although not particularly sophisticated and intellectual to the likes of Death Note and Code Geass, naruto's story and universe in general are still very comprehensive and feel very immersive for the viewer
+ the use of music is very focused and adds heavily onto the atmosphere as and when appropriate, changing the
                  mood and tone as it goes along.
+ many of the fight scenes that happen are very well thought out where characters do interesting things to try to outsmart their opponents or work together effectively to form a better strategy, generally applies for most fights
weak points
- of course the major criticism naruto gets is the insane amount of filler material/flashbacks present (almost 40% of the 500 episodes) and while this definitely prevents naruto from being a straight 9/10 due to the repetitiveness and loss of impact from overusing fillers, there is a filler guide available people use it as necessary
- naturally, naruto's art and animations are not particularly the best. some character's faces and fight scenes in general are poorly animated (e.g. naruto vs pain) although generally they are good enough to go buy most of the time. don't expect anything close to violet evergarden or anything like that
- naruto's pacing can be questionable at times, although this applies more exclusively for earlier seasons. from less important events being explored heavily to extremely draggy fight scenes, these are some of the issues with pacing. once again however, not a very big issue for the most part of naruto especially if you follow the filler guide
at the end of the day, naruto is still one of the best big-ticket mainstream animes out there with a really comprehensive universe and some of the most impactful characters out there.",8
"
                This is the second part of Naruto, a bunch of movies and 200 episode left we get a teen Naruto dealing with the worst and most heartbreaking story.
As Naruto seemed to be just a bunch of kids saving people and being Ninjas, now we get in the gist of the story, and the whole reason why I love NARUTO SHIPPUDEN this much. The story, once again follows this orphan boy who's now a trained ninja in this never ending war. I love how the story revolves around how war is wrong and we all should be pacifists, because THAT'S STILL TODAY SO NEEDED! Everyone along
                  the story you meet is just a consecuence of war crimes, and I genuinely couldn't love the story anymore. 
I think the anime is ten times better than Naruto (Naruto is the ig of the whole anime that gets better with time), I think the stories are so much more complicated, overall the plot reflect way more on peace and kindness, and even though there's a whole tone of episodes and quite some fillers, I think it's great anime to watch! (With the obvious add that this started on 2007 so it's still pretty damn sexist)",9
"
                Fillers is all I have to say. Reason for my score is fillers(38% so far). if you want a list of fillers http://www.narutohq.com/naruto-shippuden-fillers.php. So you can skip them if you start it. i'm keeping the review short.
The story has nothing special, just a knucklehead hero that saves the day and thats about it.
character development is pretty neat in this show, you can see some of the characters grow. Which is kinda cool. You can get a connection to some of the characters and that is what I Think makes this show.
Mostly this anime seems to be about fan service.

                Really good anime but 50 percent of this anime are revorey of an existing scene.
A lot of emotion but a lot of boredom.
the story, we must recognize him is very good 
unfortunately the characters are not developed enough compared to their numbers.
as I said, without the scene redundancies I would have set a minimum of 9. unfortunately the scenes completely ruin the atmosphere brought by the fighting or the scenes more generally.
also, we can have two identical narrative forms in the anime. (you will see them all right away) that concerns the trios. a stubborn, strong, and already cold rival in his youth, 
that's why
                  I put 8 in the scenario.",7
"
                Naruto Classic is good, and Shippuden starts well and remains acceptable until Pain's arc, after that it's just downhill.
from there, Shippuden takes everything that was presented in the classic and throws it in the trash, remember the charismatic characters of the classic? forget everything, what matters here is only Naruto and Sasuke. Remember that Naruto story that ""there is no destiny"" and that ""he makes his own destiny""? Forget it, Naruto is now the child of Ashura's prophecy and reincarnation.
The Arc of War is one of the worst things ever done, too much trouble, screen time for characters that didn't matter at all for that
                  part of the story, and LOTS of filler during the war, and if that weren't enough, there are even flashbacks in all episodes, a problem that has been around since classic Naruto.
The animation worsens with each episode and the end of the war, come on, the final villain is an ALIENIGINE without any development that emerged FROM NOTHING in history and was defeated by a JUTSU HARÉM.
Anyway, very bad, it's just not a complete crap, because it has Pain's arc which is good. I do not recommend",3
"
                I finished Naruto, i liked the ending, i loved the anime through my childhood and i still do, i have a lot of affection for it, it shaped my personality. But i cant say that have no problems in the plot. 
resuming, It's a lot of flashbacks, some of them useless, that tires us, like the zillion episodes fillers.
betray his own premiss, by saying that naruto was destined to save the world but in the classic he said that he does his own destiny.
And so many forgotten characters, good characters, to focus only on Naruto and Sasuke.
{Major Spoilers!}
Itachi is not a Hero! 
The anime treat itachi as a hero in the shadows but he is not, he is a genocide and a bad brother. He forces sasuke to pursuit a path of hate and pain. He made sasuke watch everyone dies in a genjutsu, and that makes the cold man that he is today. 4th Hokage, 3rd Hokage, Kakashi and even Itachi itselfs are Elite, Strong Ninjas and they dont follow a Dark path.
Itachi should at least spared the children and the inocent and Hide them since that he didnt want inoccent lifes to be lost
3rd Hokage is not a good guy
He Know that Naruto was Minato's Son but why he did not raise naruto as his own son/grandson. Instead, He left naruto at his own. 
Naruto could die at any moment and never controlled the Fox. 
He left a little kid to suffer.
Where were Kakashi, Jiraya and others when minato died? Why they didnt care for naruto? {End of the Spoiler}
The only person that its good its Iruka.
Naruto was suposed to be an Anime where anyone can be a Hokage but it becames a Anime of 'Chosen one'. To be a Hokage you have to be a chosen one, or be trained by a former hokage, that's so unfair  and like i said betray the premiss of the Anime",7
"
                I liked naruto a lot, i used to be hyped when the new episode would come, and then again we get another moodkill by another filler, its simply just to much fillers, 
i'm not planning on watching it untill it is done, cause i don't wanna have 1 episode and 20 fillers every time i'm waiting for a new episode.
Even if they say the fillers are ended, i don't have the trust in watching anymore, simply had to many downers on naruto. 
i don't wanna enjoy 5 episode's and then another bunch of shitty fillers.
I maybe would have enjoyed the fillers more if the where
                  before the war, or just in some more OVA's those happen during the war, My naruto rate dropped from 9 to 6.",6

The anime is good, I liked it, but there are points where they went wrong. Poorly used characters (that could be fucking harnessed), I also did not like the fact that they used the Edo Tensei just to have the war. And one point I did not like too, is that, from the moment Naruto went into the war, only a single day passed. Also has the fact of the doujutsus, in Naruto Classic, all had the knowledge of two doujutsus, that are respectively, Sharingan and Byakugan. They fucking enjoyed the Sharingan, until Magekyo appeared in the classic and taus, but nothing said that they
                  could summon a megazord. I know these things are secret and blablabla, but, do you really think they were thinking about these things when they created the Sharingan? (In this case Kishimoto). But, like I said, I liked the anime, the anime story until it was good ... Until the war started, that sucked. I also liked the fights, the important moments and the appearance of the Akatsuki, the Plot. So my grade is 6 for that.",6
"
                So this is not going to be a long review. Naruto is one of the most beloved manga, and it is noy hard to understand why. The setting is unique and the characters are very intresting. 
But in Shippuden all the elements that made part 1 unique are lost after a certain point. The fillers are too many making about 40 % of the series and the final arc is boring and full of plotholes. Now it might have stumbed a bit in the final arc but the ending is where it truly failed. Extremely important plotpoints are left unresolved and brushed aside and the
                  characters lose their essence. It basically feels like you are watching strangers, which can be painful especially if you have come to love the characters and mainly the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki who loses all of the qualities that made him lovable among the audiences.",6
